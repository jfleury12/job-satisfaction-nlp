Benefits are great. 401k match is hard to beat. Flight benefits are, mostly, truly wonderful and impossible to put a value on.",If you are working in ATL at the GO - world class headquarters and you’ll have a lot of events around the campus. Not so much up in MSP. If by chance you end up finding a job posting for IT (rare as Delta relies HEAVILY on contractors) and one in MSP (even rarer) - welcome back to 1985! The work is interesting but you will end up carrying dead weight (people that should have retired 10 years ago) if you want to make your job tolerable. It will be interesting to see what happens to this office in 10 years’ time when just about the entire building has retired.,Delta Airlines

21,"""Joining now, you most likely won't get health insurance, workman's comp, paid sick days & other benefits for a long time""",3.0,"Decent pay, flexibility, and flight benefits","Challenging work environment, long hours, physically demanding. If you are a ready reserve agent you will not get health insurance, workman's compensation, paid sick days, and a lower pay cap than the benefited employees. Benefited employees are not exclusively leadership positions, most are working alongside the ready reserve employees. Delta is slowly getting rid of benefited employees, when a benefited employee is fired, or retires, or leaves the company Delta will not hire more benefited employees, they will hire ready reserve employees, for every 4 benefited employees that leaves, Delta will replace them with 4 ready reserve employees, or maybe 3 ready reserve and promote one ready reserve employee from within. To move up quicker you will probably need to relocate. In 2015 on average it took 4 to 5 years to become benefited. It now might take 7 years. Delta gives the airport managers too much power with very little oversight. They have been incredibly hypocritical when it comes to firing an employee, or promotion. I will say that there were a a number of employees I loved working with.",Delta Airlines

41,"""World’s greatest airline""",4.0,"Very fun company to work for if you are enthusiastic about airlines and aviation. While base compensation is not remarkable, Delta is rare in that it actually returns a meaningful portion of its earnings to its employees through profit sharing payments in February each year. This creates incentive alignment with shareholders, who also are receiving generous dividends, which I think is brilliant. Managerial employees also receive additional annual bonuses in February, which start at around one month’s base pay, so total bonus comp for a manager can easily exceed 2 months’ base pay in these recent years of profitability. Other benefits are attractive - Including 9% total 401(k) employer contribution if employee is contributing at least 6%, and employer HSA contribution of $700+ annually if completing health tasks (checkups, screenings, etc.).","With high load factors on Delta flights (great for profit sharing), actually using standby travel benefits can be difficult. Significant middle management turnover is disruptive to developing and executing on multi-year plans and projects. Budget process is dysfunctional and poorly understood, and money is sometimes wasted that could be returned to shareholders and employees. Office environment has been undergoing remodeling to a high-density open floor plan. Not sure who this is supposed to appeal to, but it has become much harder to focus on individual work. Compensation methodology for managerial employees is opaque; management bonuses and raises, while not at all bad in recent years, seem to be drawn from a hat, and it’s hard to know where you stand and what to expect from year to year.",Delta Airlines

Career path is entirely up to the individual and their network of mentors. The ability to become a subject matter expert that is respected by the entire company and owns their projects/processes in their entirety.,Significant politics.

Their directors used the contractors as pawns as they tried to wrestle power away from each other. Down to the Director and slightly below levels of management, there was no direction given. They basically hired a bunch of different contractors from different contracting companies to work on the project. They provided ZERO leadership to tie the groups together. They left it up to the contractors to figure out all problems and resolve everything. Some of us tried. However, if other contractors essentially take the ""You're not the boss of me"" approach and won't listen to reason and refuse to implement processes that benefit everyone, it becomes a near impossible task. UX was creating designs and conducting research, and development implemented their own designs, ignoring UX design and research, and even what some of the key stakeholders and users expressly told them they wanted. When the project ultimately failed and led to one of the contractors getting scolded, everyone, from every contractor, started to take ""me vs everyone else"" approach to circling the wagons and cya, all while looking for scape goats. And this was just between contractors. It happened within contracting companies where they ate their own in attempts to point finger and say it was him, not me. ""Leadership"" was nowhere to be found. The entire environment was incredibly dysfunctional, to the extent that I have never seen before in decades of working in similarly sized companies.",Delta Airlines

It is sold as flexible hours, great flight benefits, ability to have another job (for insurance &amp; living wage). It is none of these now, though it used to be. If you are aiming for a full time Delta career, then working as a ready reserve will start you down the path to full time. But be aware- it could take YEARS (10 plus, at my station). If you are willing to relocate, it might take less time. Delta is good to their full time employees. They get decent benefits, pay and vacations - time off to enjoy their flight benefits. Unfortunately, much of the full time benefits are paid for by denying a huge part of the workforce any benefits at all.","Ready reserves, Delta's part time un-benefited workers, are the Cinderella's of Delta. They work more days a year than the full time employees who have all the benefits. They get 1 week of unpaid vacation a year, while full time employees get paid vacations starting at 2 weeks, after 1 year of employment, 3 weeks after 5 years, etc,.... A ready reserve with 15 years of service still only gets 1 week of un- paid vacation. It is almost impossible to use the benefits. Trading shifts is allowed, but it's difficult to cobble enough time to travel very far and stand-by flights are risky. You have to be able to get back in time for work. Planning a family vacation is impossible, because trading is only approved 30 days in advance at most, so you can't pay for a cruise, co-ordinate family members vacations, get a deal on a resort, because you won't know if you will get the time off until 30, or usually less days, before. Full time employees don't have this problem. Their generous paid vacation weeks allow them to plan up to a year in advance. Ready reserves work the same schedule as full time 40 hours a week employees. Their shifts are shorter. But they work 5 days a week, with no flexibility. Ready reserves used work 3 or 4 days a week and have some flexibility, which is why workers stayed with the job. The flexibility made up for the lack of benefits and allowed people to have a second job or time for school or family. Now that is impossible and most quit within the first year. Delta has a very low retention rate for ready reserves, which is a disservice to the customers, because there are constantly high numbers of inexperienced employees training. If you want a part time job and plan to use the flight benefits, go to Southwest or American. You will get some benefits and be be treated more fairly. For those wondering why I am still currently employed at Delta; all airlines are seniority based, for scheduling shift times, etc... I kept hoping things would get better, but the opposite has happened, except for a pay scale change. I have 8 years with Delta and don't want to start all over at the bottom again.

It does not give you the balance you need from personal life. If you are just in it for travel and pay check then it is fine. But the pay is too low for what you have to endure each day or night that you work there. You do not get paid certain holidays which is only meant for full-time positions.

Flight benefits are amazing and literally the only reason I’m still here.,It’s nice if you want to fly under the radar but management is insanely difficult to get in touch with if you do need something. There are so many departments in the company that we as internal customers get treated like crap and no one seems to be on the same page. You will work weekends every single weekend. You will work every single holiday. The job is stressful in a way of never being in control and getting rerouted at the mercy of scheduling. But it’s so freaking easy and repetitive that you can feel yourself getting dumber by the minute. Same issues as any customer service job as far as dealing with passengers. Also it’s not glamorous and you will spent majority of your layovers in an airport hotel with about 12 hours to rest and that’s it. Also it will do weird things to your body and health.

Which means you only receive pay and no benefits. You don’t get paid as much as part time or full time. After 8 years I only made $15. Getting on full time they only hired every couple years and it is only a few at at. I was getting pretty high up in sinoroty but it still would have taken years. Plus the full time agents make up to $30 will ready reserve make peanuts. This is there way of keeping from paying health insurance. They don’t hirer full time or partime as much to keep cost down.

There’s no if ands or buts about it. Eventually you will get hurt. You can be as “safe” as you want but lifting heavy bags everyday will break you down. Working as a gate agent you have to be mentally strong to deal will time pressure in conjunction with attending to passengers needs. (And the rude and disrespectful ones will test you) especially if there are cancellations,delays, etc... Now I must say the biggest CON is that your flight privileges are only amazing when the flight isn’t full. 95% of the time the flights are full. No matter where you are. You are flying on standby which means you get whatever seats are left if any. So you’ll spend ALL day (6am -9pm at times) at the airport trying to catch a 3 hour flight somewhere. It’s kind of a joke...So take that into consideration of all you have to deal with and is it worth it. Because be honest we all want an airline job for the benefits.

Everything you do is monitored. From how long your breaks and lunches are (and when you are allowed to take them) to your time spent handling each customer and the ratings they give you through surveys (which most of the time is based on the impression of the company as opposed to you as a worker). If any of those numbers deviate, it's noted on your record and will hurt any chances for promotion. No work-life balance. You might be stuck working mandatory overtime announced on the day-of. And if it snows and you can't get to work? Still your fault. Someone in your family dies? Two days off, that's it. Pay is absolutely horrible based on work load. If they need workers for mid level jobs, they provide ""Temporary Duty"" assignments under the guise of ""development"".

The company lets you swap shifts with co-workers - with extreme logistics you can have a week off every month.

Management never tells you what to do so long as the performance metrics are good. Mostly you can do almost whatever you want. Your individual performance is whatever is satisfactory to yourself. You are mostly on your own. You have the power to save passengers from the service of agents who stopped caring or become a service agent who stops caring working at a company too big to fail.","There is no reward for doing a good job and no punishment for doing anything unless someone complains. You can do a good job and receive complaints and be in trouble. Not because of the complaint, but because complaints need to be addressed and the supervisors hate the extra work you just gave them. The workplace is loud, and over-crowded. The maximum occupancy is often exceeded, nothing is up to code, and LAX knows they can get away with everything as an international airport will never be red-tagged. The only nice area will be the Tom Bradly Building if you are lucky enough to be there only because the private airport mall pays for building maintenance. Do not expect any help from supervisors nor management on any issues including safety. You are mostly on your own. If management looks for you it is nearly 100% because someone reported you and you are in trouble.

The ability to swap trips and trade them with available trips was a lifesaver sometimes and led to a pretty cool lifestyle. You have the ability to work a lot all at once in order to easily have 7-10 days off in a row, for example. You also have the option of just picking up available trips if you want to work more. Also, have a cool/easy trip? It might get picked up by someone else who wants to work more and you just got a free day or two. - I liked the structured yearly pay scale where you're guaranteed consistent raises throughout the years, capping off at 15 years. -Profit Sharing in February was always a treat! -I met countless celebrities, politicians, and just plain interesting people from all over the world in just a few years. -Only 6 days of being on call per month as opposed to many airlines that are full time reserve - I was based in NYC for 2 years and SLC for 6 months. Western bases are by far less stressful.","-Flying standby is stressful even though it's a perk of the job. Every year flights seem to be more and more full which means it's harder to get on them, negating the very benefit of flying for fun -Trips seem to be declining in quality. My best year was my very first year when I was most junior in 2016.. 4 hour airport sits are common in between flights, long duty days of 12-15 hours, minimum hour layovers on domestic flights only leaving you enough time to sleep, etc -Flight attendants seem to constantly be understaffed. My monthly schedule started getting more and more packed, leaving less room to move things around. - It's such a big company that you feel like a number. Your supervisor never really gets to observe how well you work and performance reviews are solely based on unreliable reviews from passengers. Passenger reviews talking about gate agents or their poor experience with TSA brings down your rating as a flight attendant. You may form somewhat of a relationship with your supervisor, only to discover you've been transferred to someone else because the base size is increasing. -Getting flown into off days, rotations changing mid-trip, and delays are always a risk with this type of job. Some might say these circumstances increased over time. I think it also depends where you're based as East Coast bases tend to have worse luck with that sort of thing. -Not necessarily home every night, so packing food for a 3 day trip can be a challenge, especially when you're trying to stay healthy. -My personal health started to decline only 4 months into the job. I have a history of autoimmune issues (which had been resolved before this job) and this lifestyle was not the best fit for me long-term. The first year I was periodically pulling 24 hour days, running on adrenaline, in order to see as much as I possibly could. The second year I slowed down substantially and tried to organize as much of a ""normal"" schedule as I could in order to help my sleep cycle/health, but realized how difficult it was with time changes and/or short layovers. Even when trying to find ""easy"" trips with short duty days and plenty of rest time, it was taking me at least 3 days to recover when I'd get home. It seemed as if all of my off days were taken up by trying to get as much rest as I could and I just couldn't catch up.

At MSP, there were a lot of issues that we gate agents experienced. Many of these issues negatively affected our work performance. Sadly, management simply never put in much effort to fix many of the issues. Some issues were addressed and fixed but not very many. Trying to get a hold of managers was almost nearly impossible. On many occasions, if we were lucky, it took a couple weeks to get an email response. Some managers abuse their work authority, are unprofessional, and often harassed employees. A few were actually caring and helpful....even were experiencing the same issues as us gate agents because their managers were disorganized and unreliable. In the end, I put in my 4 weeks notice to pursue a full-time career elsewhere. About a week before I was scheduled to leave, a manager asked if there was any chance I could maybe stay at Delta as a ready reserve once I was settled into my new job. I ended up being placed on a company leave of absence with Delta, so this way I could easily come back to work part-time once I was comfortable with my new job. Well....Delta did not keep their word.

Also, Flight Attendants do not get substantial enough pay while boarding the airplanes and in between flights while required to be on duty. The entire duty required for a workday cuts down your actual hourly pay rate to a much more minuscule pay rate.

638,"""The reality of corporate roles at Delta""",3.0,"There are many perks of working at Delta corporate including: The people you'll be work with are very smart, professional, hard working, often very experienced. The campus is going through a renovation which is a step in the right direction. Travel benefits are a nice perk (if you can use them). There's a nice fitness center for $20/month which can be a nice break. For most of us, we do what we do because we love this industry and we love learning more about how the company works. Delta wants to get better year after year and we set the industry standard. Profit sharing is huge and is a big commitment into the employee's pockets. The 9% 401K match is great! The ability to try new experiences is high, especially if you work hard and talk with your leaders. You won't be in the same role for many years.","Long work hours are the norm. It's like working in a consulting environment. You can expect to work beyond your point of happiness. 9 to 10 hour days is perfectly normal; with no time for lunch. A long day is between 10 and 13 hours long, and those happen about 5 to 10% of your time. Don't expect any sympathy from my leaders. Work life balance varies by department. Some people have plenty of time to go away every weekend, others go away a few times a year because the work load is so high. Areas to avoid: Finance, Operations Analysis &amp; Performance (OAP), and Revenue Management. Want a flexible or compressed work week... forget it. Not happening, even though it's company policy. It's not offered. period. Expect to be able to move personal appointments, dinners, dates, doctors appointments because you'll have to. Your leaders don't care that you want to do someone outside of work. Medical insurance is expensive. Expect $1350 deductible for individuals (plus over $100 month for the insurance) to $5000+ deductibles for family and ($400+ per month for the insurance) Vacation ... expect 2 weeks per year for the first 5 years. No exceptions. Though some managers don't mind if you take an extra day or two here or there. More time than you would like will be spend dealing with the many annoyances on campus from finding conference room space (get to know the admins... they control most of them), to dealing with construction noise, to last minute projects thrown at you at 4pm on a Friday, or same day deadlines, or IT issues at the worst possible time. Travel benefits seem great until you find out that they are difficult to use. It's seniority based, so don't expect to go many places. Oh, and you aren't competing against just 80000 employees, but also their kids, spouse, travel companions... they get on the plane before you. Yup, another employee's kid gets on before you do, even if they are by themselves. Oh, and you want to bring a buddy with you, that might cost $350 just to go to the west coast and they are even lower on the standby list. Not ideal for single people. Layoffs happen. Sometimes big ones like 2016, but often small ones without anyone noticing, done by individual departments. No job security. Departments aren't created equal. Some have free coffee and snacks, and team building and annual meetings (i.e. Sales) while others offer almost nothing. The commercial teams tend to offer more than the operations teams. Want lunch? The cafeteria has good food but it will cost more than whole foods. Chicken sandwich is about $7.50 (nothing included), salad bar... more than $9/lb. Expect to pay $8 to $15 for lunch. Communications is very scripted from corporate. Want to know about the campus renovations (employees weren't asked for input)?... no place to find information. Want to report an issue with the employee shuttle? Not possible. Need more information about an internal article? Yeah, forget about it. Who is responsible for things...they aren't telling. It's corporate bureaucracy at its best. Pay raises don't come annually. They come when the company feels like doing them. It's been 13 months since the last one and none has been announced this year. Very rarely is anyone ever promoted. A role must open up, then you must apply for it and interview etc. Except of course, if you are a Director and up; those seem to happen more often than not. If you like team building and other fun activities like that, or really like when a company celebrates your birthday. Wrong place for that. Not likely to happen.",Delta Airlines

You are mandated to work no more than 1400 hours a year on a fixed schedule, which changes every 6 months. My station mandates that all RR agents work that 1400 hours a year so finding a FT job to work around the twice a year changing schedule is nearly impossible. Also, if flights are delayed and you work an afternoon shift, you are mandated to stay (sometimes many many hours) until your delayed flight takes off. This will interfere with any secondary job or obligations you have outside of your part time job with Delta. Delayed flights happen daily so YES, it will definitely happen to you and repeatedly. I have seen FT positions be filled in a way which is not accordIng to policy or seniority. The culture and values that the company says they have are often quite different than what I see happening at my station with management. My station has a high management turnover. In my short 2.5 years of being there, there is not one general manager, nor operating service manager, that was there when I started. Our current management seems to change the rules every 3 months to suit their needs. No consistency in enforcing rules/policies makes for disgruntled employees. I truly am beginning to feel that with Delta it is who you know, not what you know that will get you further.",Delta Airlines

In Detroit the waiting list for ready reserves (Delta’s version of part time) that want to become full time is 2 1/2 years long. Management doesn’t care for success of individuals and creates a culture of fear in its employees. Employees are afraid to speak out against injustice because they fear being targeted, singled out and terminated. This is the norm for other employees who has spoken out. Employees are bullied by middle management while upper management turns a blind eye and they don’t have adequate hr to protect and support them. In Detroit for the entire terminal there’s only one hr primary contact person. That’s hundreds of employees and only one person to represent them. Unacceptable for a Fortune 500 company that has over 80k employees. They bully their hourly employees who want union protection to fight on their behalf for better wages, work environment and benefits. The ability to transfer to another department ( ex: terminal or customer service to general Office or corporate) is non existent regardless of your education and background. I have a MBA and tried for 2 years before I left to get a better suited position but was stuck working part time.

969,"""Disgraceful company""",1.0,You make good friends. That's about it.,"I can't say enough bad things about this company. I was here almost three years. I fell for the brainwashing and the ""family"" talk at the beginning. It wasn't until a year in that I started to see through it all. Employee morale is at an all time low. You are used and abused every single day. You work 12-14 hour days with no breaks, constant abuse and bullying from passengers, and in horrible disgusting work conditions. When you are reaching the 15 hour duty limit, you are entitled to walking away but most of us were bullied and threatened into staying. Say goodbye to ANY holidays with family at home ever again. Even memorial day, labor day, etc. During the summer you are forced to be constantly away from home as you work 100+ hours. One months this summer, I was home only 5 days, and that was without picking up any extra trips. You are punished for being sick. The company literally says they ""expect"" you to only be sick twice a year. Is this a joke? We work on disgusting, never cleaned airplanes filled with bacteria while passengers are coughing, sneezing, vomiting, all day long. We hardly ever sleep, and when we do, it is often interrupted by phone calls from crew scheduling. The long days, lack of sleep deprivation, and no breaks are incredibly hard on our bodies and unhealthy. But we can never get sick?? Oh and good luck seeing a doctor when you ARE sick, as Delta proudly boasts the worst health insurance in the industry. Every single time I picked up prescriptions, the pharmacists were embarrassed to tell me the cost, or often whispered it to me. They have told me that they never see costs this high, and when they do, it is with someone who doesn't even HAVE insurance. The passenger behaviour has gotten OUT OF CONTROL. This behaviour and this entitlement was single handedly created by Delta!! I showed up to work every single day on time, in my three years there I only called out sick four times. I came to work, I was kind and respectful to passengers , and all I received in return was constant abuse and disrespect from the passengers and company. Passengers would write in making up stories about you that never happened, hoping they'd get some kind of compensation. You'd be called in to talk to your manager about the write up and then you'd be punished for something that never happened!! The company NEVER had your back. Welcome to the ""family"" !!! The company will lie to you day in and day out. We are ""innovation, expanding, fixing, improving. "" Delta was never doing any of those thing. Its no wonder the staffing problems have gotten out of control, because all of the flight attendants are calling out sick. Why? Some of them are actually sick. Most of them just WANT TO BE HOME and do not want to work because of how horrible the conditions have become! The trips have gotten worse and worse. The duty days are longer and longer, and without a union and contract things will only continue to get worse!! I left before I had to stand by and watch the company fall to pieces. You are nothing but a number here. All of us KNOW what is happening, some are turning a blind eye, too afraid to speak up. If you speak up and ask for respect and fairness, you are punished. Many are finally opening their eyes and waking up to the constant abuse and disrespect from the company. Unfortunately only a few of us are brave enough to speak up, or to leave so this company can no longer abuse you.",Delta Airlines

We have the best pay and benefits in the industry! Our leadership make sure we our well informed of the direction of the company.,The only downside I can think of is that I didn't start my career with Delta soon enough. I work part-time so my opinions for advancement are limited. Once I retire from my full- time employer that should change,Delta Airlines

The Delta Family is like none other I've experienced which I will cherish for a life time.","Difficult to advance; primarily due to the reduction in FTE count and increase in Contractors.

No representation for employees and can fire you for ANYTHING even with no reason. There is no real support or help in the company. They tell you were family, but will drag you out like the trash in your house. They treat I would say flight attendants like merde.

Other divisions in the company do not respect Reservations and upper management does not consider anyone here for corporate level promotions - your highest goal will be to become a manager of other reservations agents. The flight benefits are good if you are single, but if you have a family they simply will not do much for you beyond once a year or so. This job is highly repetitive and incredibly boring: agents take 20,000+ calls a year and most of them are exactly the same: people who can't figure out how to use the website and want you to assign their seats or change their flights. Local management is a joke - they cannot do they jobs of frontline staff and have no decision making capability, they answer entirely to Atlanta. Promotions are based on race and gender and not on merit - you will have many people above you who you would not trust to even mow your lawn. Think twice if you are taking this job merely for flight benefits or as a second career you don't really need - you will not enjoy this work. If this is the best job you can get because of a limited education and no other career prospects, this is a reliable paycheck with a decent company, but if you went to college or have talent in any other industry - go somewhere where promotions and advancement come regularly instead of at Delta where they come almost never.

Delta designs a lot of the domestic trips to be 12 or 13 hour duty days, with 3 and 4 hour sits between each leg, allowing themselves free airport standby employees who are basically unpaid but required to be there. Stand by travel is not a good idea if you really have plans that you have committed to, I usually ended up buying tickets to make sure I got somewhere in time or if I had reservations made, so no money savings there. Lowest pay in airline industry if you adjust for duty day period required per trip, and not just count flight hours. Some days are blocked so you cannot swap off of those days to improve your schedule, yet there is no added incentive pay to make it worth your wile to work the shift. Airplanes have all been reconfigured so that there are additional passenger seats, but no where for flight attendants to sit or eat a meal in privacy for a few minutes.

1651,"""Flight Attendant""",5.0,"I miss working with Delta so much. I quit because I had a newborn at the time and was based in New York which was a doubletter commute. It was tough so I resigned and have regretted it since then. I loved my job! It was my dream job and I was lucky enough to get to do it. I had a little bit of seniority so I was able to make my work schedule a little more flexible. I met some wonderful people and saw some amazing places and learned a lot about other cultures. My benefits were great! I felt like management always had my back and although you rarely flew with the people you still felt like a big family. After all, you never know who your going to eating Thanksgiving dinner with!",Sometimes your day can start out looking like a piece of cake and turn into a long nightmare just to get to your layover city to find you have no hotel but it always works out in the end.

1659,"""Great job for college students wanting to see the world.""",1.0,"I got to see the world paying just the taxes for flights. I met a lot of nice people working 5 years for the company. If you are working in a large department, you can swap and get any days off you need. If you work in a small department like I had, it becomes rather difficult to get days off.","A lot of ghetto people work for Delta. These people will be your colleagues. Many people from my training class were suspended or terminated because of their attitudes and behaviors. Again, it's the crowd you are working with in customer service. Performance leaders are clueless and do not promote based on experience and education. Delta claims that they care about helping those who are advancing themselves. However, it is based on who you know. I pursued my master's degree while at Delta and was given a hard time to even get a day off for my graduation in my department. I was told I go to the university of Delta and my schoolwork comes second. This was by a lead agent no less. Once complaining to the manager, nothing was resolved. Lower management is very resentful over those who get advanced degrees and then leave Delta to pursue a real career. The pay is awful and they claim it's industry standard. It is not. Southwest workers make more and Jet blue workers top out faster. It will take you ten years to go from 12 dollars to 20 dollars as a csa. Also, holidays are hit or miss. Either you get lucky and your bid coincides with the day off or you will not be seeing your family on the holidays until you accumulate 3 to 4 years seniority more years for closed departments. All in all, Delta was what I needed to get through college. I loved Delta but the same was not reciprocated with the management they place in charge. Don't get stuck as a csa for life, move around a lot or use the position as a way to get through college and your advanced degree. Also, the CEO is on a board for united Healthcare. However, your insurance that you get if you are full time is overpriced and not worth it.",Delta Airlines

I get to work around airplanes.","No real possibility for advancement, as the only ""step up"" - and it's a minor one - from my job is to work the ticket counter and I have no interest in working that position. Also, some other Delta employees have listed flight benefits as perks. Because my work is through a contract company, we receive no flight benefits. Or insurance. Or vacation.
