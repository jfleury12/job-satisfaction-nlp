2,Amazon,"The management process is abusive, and I'm currently a manager. I've seen too much ""behind the wall"" and hate how our individual performers can be treated. You are forced to ride people and stack rank employees...I've been forced to give good employees bad overall ratings because of politics and stack ranking.","Jeff Bezos and his ""S-Team"" are brilliant and continue to make great decisions for long-term growth. You work with smart people, you work on exciting projects, you are pushed to your limits...which can be rewarding when you accomplish great things. The diversity of the potential work and innovation can be very alluring.

4,Amazon,"No cons, so far - seriously. Like I said, I'm sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there, but this is an amazing job, an amazing opportunity, and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that it's a little chilly in our building. I can live with that. Does Amazon demand high quality, measurable results? Yes! Is it hard work? Yes! Is it rewarding? Yes! So I'm not calling that a 'con'. Work/life balance seems comparable to other places I've worked - not worse.","I've been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. Every company I've ever worked for talks about how important the customer is, but on day 2, they're forgotten. Amazon seems to genuinely focus on what's best for the customer, and it's awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up, and make decisions focused on long-term customer satisfaction. The opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited, and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well. I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here.",5.0,"""An Amazing Place to Work"""
5,Amazon,"- You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that. - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today. It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience. I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work for just anyone.","Amazon is doing lot's of cool stuff...but lots of boring stuff too. There are really well run teams...and very badly run teams. The experience for software managers and engineers is all over the board, from really run low operational load teams to teams where people burn out after a year. - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived. You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned. There aren't many slackers here, and they don't survive long. - We work on so much stuff that there's always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on (note that it's an 'opportunity', one that you have to pursue) - A chance to make a huge difference - A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about yourself - Amazon encourages high mobility - even your manager can't prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks (normally, more than a few months under unusual conditions). - Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain",4.0,"""Can be amazing for some people, horrible for others"""
6,Amazon,"Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit (intelligence, strategic vision) nor pedigree (academic or professional accomplishments), most of those who become successful do so in treacherous, low cunning ways. Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones; or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire; or Barrow and O'Brien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey. This is every day leadership behavior at Amazon. The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to ""manage people."" The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling, but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges, then just converted their winky nod nod good 'ol boy shenanigans into a ""ask no questions, have no introspection"" company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism. Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded, and the connected, incestuous, privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street.",This company gets A list performance from C list employees.

You have to keep up with your quota, and if your not making it they are going to check into why, and if you continue to not make your quotes and continue to not do the requirements the company wants from you, they can terminate you or move you to another department as well. The quota is packing a package, scanned, correct box used for shipment, giving the right spoo sticker for shipping and putting dunnage and taping up the box as needed and sending it down the conveyer belt to ship out in one minute.

85,Amazon,"1. Work/Life Balance- Again, depending on what org you are in, this will vary dramatically... In Operations specifically, work-life balance can be abysmal during certain times of the year (i.e. Nov/Dec). Outside of peak, hours are better; but Operations can still be very demanding on your schedule. You are on your feet 10-14 hours a day, so maintaining a healthy ""off-work routine"" (i.e. going to gym, preparing healthy meals, etc.) can be challenging as most people are physically/mentally tired after a shift. 2. Relocation- Amazon will never force you to relocate... But if you are relocatable, you will LIKELY have more opportunity than those who are not. I moved several times and enjoyed living in different cities across the United States, but if you are looking to stay in one place for an extended period of time, understand that this could slow your growth. The plus side to this is that Amazon is virtually everywhere... Tons of opportunities if you are flexible in your location. 3. The culture of always being accessible- Similar to my first point, Amazon expects you to always be accessible. If you are looking for a job where you can clock-in/clock-out and be done until the next shift, Amazon is not the right fit for you. Part of this is due to the extraordinary amount of information you will have to synthesize and process prior to a shift starting. Amazon is 24/7 and innovation occurs rapidly. It is not uncommon for entire processes to change overnight; which means as a leader, you must be able to digest this information and take action.","1. Great Place to catapult your career- Really.. there are not many places where you can go from front line management to senior leadership in 3-5 years. 2. Smart co-workers- If you are used to being the smartest person in the room, join Amazon... You will be cured of that burden very quickly. This is actually a good thing because most co-workers are there to help you learn and progress within the company. You will likely develop long-lasting friendships here. 3. Innovation is fast and expected- If you enjoy improving processes and/or flexing your creative muscles, Amazon is a great place to be. Generally speaking, innovation is expected on some level. If you are going into Operations specifically, I would recommend obtaining a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt (or Black Belt if you want a more in-depth training) to help familiarize yourself with key terms and processes. 4.

305,Amazon,"The pay is drastically low compared to other HR peers inside and outside the industry. It’s terrible knowing that we work TWICE as hard as most employees in the global workforce but make a fraction of what they make. For the most part, this is true for other roles such as L4 and L5 Area Managers, Loss Prevention Specialists, and other entry/mid-level roles. If you are under poor leadership which is unfortunately likely despite Amazon’s claim to “Hire and Develop the Best”, then it makes your work and life nearly unbearable. You feel stuck and probably won’t be promoted as equitably as your peers even if you are a Top Tier or Highly Valued employee. It feels like a grave punishment to your career when you are trying to shine under terrible leaders or a boss that overcompensates. For Amazon to be one of the most diverse companies I have ever seen, they deal with the most discrimination and prejudice that I have never seen in my life. This goes for any protected class such as the LGBTQ+ community, disabled persons, people who practice a religion other than Christianity, etc. It is rampant within their fulfillment and logistics areas but Corporate seems to have a different experience. Joining Amazon’s largest population, their “warehousing” industry will be NOTHING like what you see in Seattle or any of their regional headquarters. You have a 90% chance of never meeting your most senior leaders that report to our Lord and savior, Jeff Bezos. Do not expect to meet him either. Amazon is way too massive for you to make connections outside of 3 levels above you. Changes are happening daily. Literally. This is not a joke. We all get daily or weekly emails about what is changing and sometimes it can be an entire process to where you’re unlearning something you just learned. Amazon will never stick with anything for an ample period of time. Your accomplishments fade just as fast because of this. Amazon has an emotionally abusive culture that screams “you are worthless and your accomplishments are a day old so get over it”. You can literally give your heart and soul to Amazon and it will never be good enough. Your stakeholders will let you know that. The Associates you encounter on a day to day are extremely needy and refuse to use the resources given to them many times to answer their questions. You find yourself in a never ending time loop repeating information. The job can also be highly tactical; even as a HR Business Partner, such as tending to menial timecard questions or physically signing someone up for text message notifications with their phone because they don’t know how. It is also very common to deal with irate, irrational, and downright disrespectful Associates but Amazon’s culture is for HR to endlessly take the abuse in the name of customer obsession. It mentally starts to drive you crazy because there is at least one Associate every day that tries to push you over the edge. HR doesn’t get paid enough at Amazon for this and HR for HR is a complete joke when you need resources (like reporting a boss who is unethical). HR employees at Amazon deserve better and should have mental health days to escape the anguish the role causes us. Fix the biases in promoting people. I don’t know how Amazon hasn’t faced several lawsuits because of this. Leaders will go through what’s called Operations Leadership Review and choose people based on likability and other unlawful things and skip over people who need extra coaching or are more talented.","Amazon is a company that seemingly offers a lot of opportunity, and for the right person, it can be endless. This is why people never want to leave; especially if they have FOMO (fear of missing out from an employer that seems to be taking over the world). People tend to promote quickly; which is a sign not to get too comfortable. It seems to be fairly easy to get a transfer if a person wants to relocate.

769,Amazon,"Employee leveling and role classification is highly subjective and counterintuitive. High performance and role expansion does not lead to promotion - surprisingly, (by policy) neither does transferring to a higher level/wider scope position, as you have to prove yourself in the new role to even be considered for the advertised level of the position. Time Off policies are on the weak side - save for places like CA that have better employee protection laws, salaried employees get six paid US holidays, max of 4 wks of paid vacation earned per year (after 6 years), with 160hr accumulation cap. 48 hrs/yr of personal/sick time with 72 hr cap where required by law, otherwise 'use or lose'. Want to take a paid 6 week sabbatical after years of dedicated service? Forget it - you'll burn all your PTO and still not have enough. Amazon subscribes to the 'open workspace' idea, so if you find having your co-workers on every side of you without partitions counterproductive you won't be happy here. You can request a set of headphones to block out the noise. Amazon has a mentor program, but it isn't well executed or promoted - more of an opt-in wild west sort of thing. I've seen other companies build and promote highly qualified employees through good mentorship and oversight - Amazon should do the same. Amazon has a very low top end cap on base salaries, preferring to pay employees in stock for tax reasons. This is nice when the stock does well, and supposedly the company will adjust payouts during annual reviews if the stock isn't doing well. Conversely, if the stock happens to be doing well during the review period then the company sees that as the equivalent of a pay raise, i.e. you won't get one. Thus an average employee and an exceptional one are rewarded equally.","Good health and stock benefits, opportunity for internal transfer, surprising amount of entrepreneurial culture given size, cutting edge technology, smart coworkers.
