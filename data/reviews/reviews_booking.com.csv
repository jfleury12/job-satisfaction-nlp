0,0,the booking.com experience has no rival,5.0,i chose booking because of the kind of work i would be doing the people that interviewed me which would be the my working colleagues and because of all the booking.com experience described in the material i received. everything is going the way it was described. other than that in booking.com you are valuable. i had a short start and then felt sick serious disease and since then i had ups and downs and my management at booking gave me every opportunity to recover to work on things i was able to due to my condition and so on. i am still under recovery and the company still values me at most providing me help and support beyond expectations.,i cant name a con at this moment. even the con for me which is the fact that all offices is on the city center which is hard to reach by car for most of my colleagues this is a pro because of the multitute of public transportation modals they can use.,Booking.com

5,5,major issues under the surface,2.0,its not the worst place ive worked. the company has lots of cash and will probably always be a big player in europe although it faces major competitive threats abroad. thinks of itself as a global player but quickly becoming more of a regional one.,while the company claims to be data driven the culture is more consensus and relationship based rather than metrics and performance driven. data is still always part of the conversation but it isnt used intelligently  at least not very often. there is a strict hierarchy with those in hq above all the rest in power and authority  although usually not in intelligence. if you work with hq you will have to spend a lot of time sucking up to your peers and superiors in amsterdam. while the company preaches diversity this exists mostly at the lower levels. at the end of the day its a dutch company and that cultural identity supersedes everything else  even performance and common sense.,Booking.com

34,34,dont just dont.,1.0,free fruit sometimes and candy,you love toxic environments heva passion for zero stability and enjoy playing russian roulette with unstable management then booking.com is the perfect place for you to work at. the lack of professionalism and transparency from management is embarrassing . the constant harassing of good employees drives many people to quit the job more often than not while the managers are allowed to get away with everything. they can do whatever they want with your pto and say you missed days when you didnt. the policies are inconsistent and vague things change regularly and employees are never informed and our benefits are either taken away or reduced. our insurance recently went up yet a pay increase is apparently impossible. you can be here for 34 years and your pay wont even increase by a dollar per hour. for a multibillion company their most important employees aka the agents dont get paid a living wage and will have to rely on part time jobs and credit cards to get by while managers and executives fill their pockets.no one really ever knows whats going on people are told to do one thing and then are told to do the exact opposite by management and support staff the system constantly crashes and there is a multitude of bugs on a regular basis. they want you to believe that we are innovative and advanced but are just rolling out things that other companies have been doing for years. they promote healthy living yet the canteen fridges have had black mold and smell terrible on multiple occasions we get food thats already expired or has mold in it and they could care less about the mental health of their employees.nbsp if you want to advance within the company dont even bother. most internal openings already have a name to them and they are opened to others only for legalitynbspreasons. hr will do nothing to favor the employees and instead fall into the high school mentality with management ignoring issues that few are brave enough to report. if you report something anonymously somehow the person youre reporting will find out and retaliation will ensue even though is prohibited. favoritism and bootlicking will get you everywhere. good numbers good behaviors and work ethic will ensure that you are stuck in the same job for years on end and even risk termination.nbspnbsp do yourself and favor and dont bother applying here. this place is not worth it.nbsp,Booking.com
35,35,okay place to work,4.0,free fruits fab friday and all the other events every now and then.,too focused on the numbers that a lot of staff just leave a mess because theyre so in a hurry to move on to the next customer.,Booking.com

38,38,good company to work for,4.0,great people all around and fun environment,middle and executive management is not suited or aligned to ceo expectations,Booking.com
39,39,good compensation but the job is horrible,1.0, after more or less a year i was making 16 per hour.  work on any weekend day was paid with a premium and overtime was consistently available.  thus making 45k a year on an entry level nodegreerequired customer service job was entirely possible.  pto  floating holidays amounted to 20 days off per year.  generous 401k., management is a joke. every week everything changed with new guidelines that directly contradicted previous ones being implemented without notice or training.  some of the managers and team leads should look for psychiatric counseling. their negative energy is palpable.  everyone desperately wants to get a job elsewhere but the ok pay and the good benefits are a factor. so a lot of people stay even hating what they do.  most hotel ownersmanagers actually despise working with booking. some feel scammed by it others are unable to understand andor learn how the site and the interface work. its mostly not their fault as everything is overly complicated and technically cheap. but their bitter dissatisfaction with booking eventually contaminates most calls and the job becomes excruciating.,Booking.com
40,40,i actually miss it a lot,5.0, i got to meet and talk to so many different people from all around the world  literally on a daily basis it was truly fascinating.  the other booking.com staff are excellent and always quick to assist you when you need help huge shoutout to the seniors their jobs are arguably the hardest  browsing the booking.com website itself while assisting guests on the phone has truly instilled in me such a powerful desire to travel to as many different places as possible in the foreseeable future not just in my own country but in every other country, this is more of a personal con but sometimes dealing with the overly negative and hysterical guests was difficult and often triggered my anxiety. if you suffer from the same issue then you may need to find a way to deal with it while under pressure  and sometimes there is a lot of pressure.  sometimes it was difficult to maintain a good set of metrics i struggled the most with receiving positive customer satisfaction surveys back  but this only is because i had trouble with pushing for the csats and encouraging guests to fill them out. if you just get into the habit of pushing the surveys then you have nothing to worry about  this may have been exclusive to the location i worked at but there wasnt a lot of recognition from management for the agents who worked harder and went above and beyond to deliver that authentic wow experience to the guests. my locations management in particular also really struggled with keeping their favoritism under wraps and it made some of the agents feel left out and unimportant.  agents at my location also did not receive the pay for performance when it was rightfully due to them. again  this was only an issue at my particular call center.  disclaimer most of these cons only apply to the location i worked at. the location i worked at was a thirdparty outsource and was not an actual booking.com location. i am not educated on the condition and atmosphere the actual booking.com call centers but i imagine that they were significantly better. the agents and seniors from the other sites that i got to speak to were wonderful and very easy to work with. the positive ratings found throughout this survey apply only to my experience with the people employed at the official booking.com call centers.,Booking.com

49,49,amazing coworkers with warm hearts,3.0,i absolutely love and respected the people i worked with at my site it was a very diverse and fun uplifting environment especially it being a call center so everyone spoke different languages with lots of delicious potlucks and laughs. there was definitely a family vibe and that is 100 because of the individuals at that site. i will always be grateful for the incredible people i met while at booking.,this may have changed since i finished my time...but not a lot of opportunities to growth within the adminpeople team department because it is quite small. specifically on peoplehr team within leadership there is lack of diversity i.e no women of color leading lots of gate keeping with information and lack of transparency when people were let gofired etc,Booking.com
50,50,great place to work,5.0,the people  the opportunities  the support  the environment ,its cold in here lol,Booking.com
51,51,diverse setting but company slowly becoming less desirable to work for,3.0,diverse and friendly work environment not scripted dialogue not forced to sell anything. great benefits yearly gifts bonuses,management is not realistic as far as the expectations put on the employee number system they use to represent employee standing is quite flawed company becoming more robotic and less concerned about employees pay raises are a bit low managers say they are forced to mark employees as needs improvement even if they are doing well. managers are not qualified and do not know the job so they set unrealistic goals and expectations for the employees no sick time off so if you get sick be careful with planning a vacation,Booking.com
52,52,going down in flames,2.0,will give you call center experience use it to find something better  your peers are very friendly and you will learn alot from them benefits are great,when i first arrived at booking.com it was a really up and coming job in the orlando area. the pay was really great for the work you did and the metrics where very attainable. it was a fun atmosphere and there was a family kind of vibe that you got at work. in the last year this changed drastically but it seemed to be only the us offices. the disregard for the csp department is honestly disheartening. due to the fact that we are not unionized we do the busy work of 5 departments and growing. we have to deal with upper management mistakes and then have it adversely affect our satisfaction score while still being held responsible. meanwhile whoevers mistake it was gets to say my bad this is not an exaggeration this actually occurred. they do an awful job of keeping up with competitors as far as platform options and i am not quite sure who their programmers and developers are but they do an awful job. the site will have a major crash once a month and its riddled with bugs they are slow to fix or just never do. you are informed in the beginning that there are quite alot of changes. this is true and to be expected but this also does not just mean changes to procedures. you will have a new team lead a new desk a new seating area every three months. the most impactful of these is the team lead aspect as this is the person to help you with your metrics and development to grow in the company. one day you will have a great team lead that wants to help your grow and the next you have some new guy that is just stressing over metrics. the comments about favoritism in promotions is very true but with the number of people honestly growing in the company as they promise you is not a possibility. lastly upper managements csms expectations are contradictory and expectations are unreasonable.,Booking.com
53,53,if it looks too good to be true... it probably is.,2.0,quarterly bonuses that can range from 0 to 8 of the quarterly salary based on performance. set days off. compensation time for working holidays.,too many changes all at once. unattainable key performance indicators. no recognition for anything positive only reprimands for bad months. management continuously increases work load and training needed without a pay increase. in all worthwhile jobs the more experience qualifications or skills needed to do the job the higher the compensation. this does not happen at booking.com especially in the usa. thankfully canada and europe are protected by unions however the customer service offices in usa get bombarded with work for the same pay. nonexistent advancement opportunities. no matter how much experience you have or how well everything goes the hiring teams will always have someone already set for the position before opening the application. 99 of the employees have no chance to move up without being constantly in a hiring managers or influencers business. if you work on the customer service partner side you are a second rate employee. always the afterthought and always paying for the mistakes of higher up.,Booking.com

58,58,account manager,3.0,great benefits amazing offices learning opportunities in different offices cool swag lots of healthy snacks in offices and more,booking north america does not live the culture as it is in europe. offices have favoritism 100 if you dont kiss on people the moment you arrive with the area manager or your manager you wont grow anywhere. friendship gets in between the jobs and people dont get what they want cause they deserve it more so because they knew who to connect with to make it there. if you complain with hr regarding these serious issues nothing will happen because again favoritism takes place. in other words booking na is pretty corrupted. if you say the truth of what is happening trust me you will be hated and theyll do anything possible so you quit.,Booking.com
59,59,its good,3.0,free fruit  vegetables flexible hours benefits,team leads pick favorites all the time,Booking.com
60,60,good benefits fake family environment,3.0,free food free coffee location is convenient. chill environment. pay is decent only if you work the night shift where you can get paid almost up to 16.50 regular pay is 14.25. if you do ot your checks can average about 15002000 a week but of course thats working 1012hr shifts 56 days a week. it starts out wonderful. the first two weeks of training they make you do for the first part of your position customer service guest executive. they are very hands on but only give you about 10 of information for you and then send you out to the floor for a month.,if youre not used to customer service working in a fast paced environment or used to teaching yourself you are thrown to the wolves. while there are plenty of employees around that could help you are assigned to a specific team and if people dont know you they make it seem like youre a bother to them. i unfortunately was 1 of 6 others who were not assigned to a team once we officially started. we were all placed on different teams as foster kids as they called us. the team i was put on were only there for about 2hrs of my shift i worked 5pm130am and by then everyone was gone. who did i have to ask for help all those hours no one except the other 3 girls who also had no team or we had to call the senior line religiously to make sure we were doing things correctly. we all had to help each other get by and figure things out. a month later they bring you back for two more weeks of training to be a specialist and you learn more about the things you couldnt work on as an executive. the third month they finally hired a team lead and i was assigned but they did not start to actually coach me on things until halfway through the third month. this place likes to talk about being empowered and lifting people up but it has a very fake family corporate feel. promotions are given to those that are loyal to management. if management doesnt like you theyll set you up for failure to create a situation where they might have an excuse to terminate an otherwise great employee. i was fired by someone in the company who i was friends with on social media and they reported my posts about celebrating my success for completion of training with the company and also several praises i received from guests as well. whatever jealousy or personal vendetta they had against me worked. of course the company wont admit that for the persons protection but i had made those posts months prior and i had recently not had good relations with the person who reported me. i have never worked for a company that disciplines people for celebrating success with the company they work for. my advice use this as a stepping stone to increase your customer service and problem solving skills. unless you are a teachers pet and fit in with the high school clique feel by all means they will welcome you with cake and cookies...literally.,Booking.com
61,61,some potential,1.0,i think the company has great values and overall they have given me the opportunity to acquire more experience in the industry.,defenetly management needs to either be replaced or they must receive extensive trainings on how to interact with employees how to be fair with everyone. you do not get promoted unless you are friends with someone. they hire people that do not qualify for leadership roles just because he is a friend.,Booking.com
62,62,empowering people to experience the world,5.0,booking.com is the leading digital travel company dedicated to supporting millions of customers around the world avid travelers who are eager to book their next destination. the working environment although it has changed and evolved a lot from a startup environment 7 years ago when i joined is amazing to see the growth and progress that takes us here and what excites me more is the opportunities ahead from artificial intelligence investments in tel aviv to our customer care centers across the globe we are a global company but locally relevant. internal benefits include health plan pto and for me the most imporant a lot of investment in learning amp development with annual benefits that could be used towards your development through internal or external courses. the work environment is also very rich with different backgrounds and professionals from different areas that compose a rich and diverse culture.,we have been through changes kind of a growing pain which is necessary to keep the company competitive in a changing landscape of global tourism. if you are willing to accept change on a day to day basis this is definitely a place to be,Booking.com

75,75,steady decline,2.0,i joined booking.com right out of college. i had the opportunity to travel to 7 different cities and 4 countries while working at booking. 2 years ago i was full of aspirations and goals for my professional career. booking is a great place to begin. you have a great work life balance and flex scheduling. as a credit controller you learn how to negotiate with partners soft phone skills team work and account management. but over the last 2 years that has drastically changed. i made some great friends at booking and most of the people are very friendly.,booking has slowly declined over the last 2 years. management is all about office politics and they only help their favorites. the bonus structure is terrible. for example a top performing employee receives 1 higher of a bonus than an employee that does the bare minimum. management has cut bonuses to save the company money because of the slowed growth. for christmas we did not get a gift or a bonus but rather we received a cookie for our hard work. there are a few managers that will undercut their employees ideas and act as if they are their own for their own gain. they also began taking away our 2 15 minute allowed breaks during the day. booking continues to pay their employees poorly and their are limited opportunities for advancement. the credit control position is becoming more automated and more customer service like.,Booking.com

104,104,an amazing company,5.0,one of the best reasons to work at booking.com is its culture and values. an amazing place that empower you and helps you to embrace who you are as a professional. the company is always providing trainings to develop your skills. i really love how things changes all the time not everybody likes it but i love it because there is no way to get bored and beside that you are always learning something new and facing new challenges. i love how the company has been structuring its fields all internal tools and work around this to improve. the company does everything go above and beyond to offer the best support ever to partners and guests booking through. benefits are amazing getting a percentage off in bookings help with external trainings and managers helping with pdp.,the company should be more flexible with locations to work and expand some interesting positions to others countriesregions beyond amsterdam. sadly the big annual meeting that used to be in amsterdam is not happening anymore but i hope the company finds a way to keep the cultural exchange and region experience exchange.,Booking.com
105,105,management sucks and your mental state is not worth the money sometimes.,2.0,sometimes they offer free lunches pto overtime,management breaks or makes the job and recently management has caused so many people to quit or find other opportunities. i worked there 3 years and had to leave because they hardly offered new shifts. when they did it always seemed people that sucked up to team leads and management would get morning shifts. everything changed when i started it wasnt stressful and our main goal was to provide great customer service to our guests. now they are numbers based when this job doesnt require any sales or retention of guests. they make you worry about your talk time customer satisfaction your adherence hold time your contacts per hour on phones and email finalize and then make you track every reservation you worked on. basically the job is being micro managed and are just money hungry. booking offered a trip to amsterdam for conferences but that was cancelled. they are open 365 days they do not close for any holiday. so chances of you working important holidays are high. i spend my new years at work when the clock hit 1200 am january 1st. management will stab you in the back especially if they do not like you. ive seen it happen to a lot of people. management is bad favoritism stressful dispensable they dont care about you.,Booking.com
106,106,customer service executive,3.0,in the beginning everything is wonderful. they pride themselves in honoring their employees with monthly potlucks good benefits maternity leave trip to amsterdam overtime travel benefits. you make friends from all over the world pto decent pay free fruit.,the work is very tedious and the micromanagement is overbearing. it is also very difficult to move up in the company since the promotions are not based on merits but companionship with other team leadscsm. they would much rather hire someone new instead of giving the opportunity to internal candidates and i saw this many times during my time there. management is not very transparent in the orlando office anyway. micromanagement at its finest unflexible with schedules you have to wait for years to possibly change your shift and when you want to you have to reapply to the position again like if youre new seniority mean nothing in this company  they say they want good workers and not showponys but none of that really matters as long as you are part of the managers crew difficult to get promoted inadequate management tedious work unreasonable kpi expectations some things are out of your control and you are penalized for them anyways.  the website has so many problems and they rather put the blame on the hotels instead of taking responsability and fixing the issues.  working here made me never want to book through a 3rd party site ever again,Booking.com
107,107,great company to work for,4.0,medical insurance quarterly bonus paid holidays company diversity laid back atmosphere the company really loves the employees,every quarter the metrics change what your bonus is based off of as soon as you get accumulated to the new structure there is a change. i wish the management would not make so many changes every 3 months not only is it annoying but its hard to stay motivated. they took away our yearly company event and made it local which is a bummer.,Booking.com
108,108,improvement needed,1.0,the customers make the day go by fast.,some of the team leads take their job way too serious. on the day shift she would like to be more of a parent than a team leader. she doesnt know how to speak to her to team members or coach them no one likes her. i would not recommend booking.com especially with the team lead i have.,Booking.com
109,109,you definitely need to be the right kind of person to be happy here,2.0,they are pretty generous with free stuff  like fruit the gym free swag etc.  and the shift premiums and quarterly bonuses are pretty solid. my colleagues are cool too like i havent met many people that i take issue with and unless ive just avoided it i dont really experience much negative office gossip.,good managers at least in this office are pretty few and far between. it almost feels like you have to know someone to be assigned to a good team lead. for example i was assigned one of the worse managers  focused heavily on numbers and doesnt treat her team like theyre humans that sometimes have personal issues they need to deal with that come before work. micromanagement is abundant and like i said if you dont know someone important or have incredible numbers they just want to get rid of you. ive even escalated issues to hr and they either ignore them or do the bare minimum to help.,Booking.com
110,110,everything must change....,3.0,fantastic benefits and physical environment to work in. diverse workforce and the ability to interact with people from all over the world.,it was once a great place to work. one was able to manage his team as if it were your own company. local director hired to many green managers that just do not understand how to manage humans. they are regularly trying to paint all employees with the same brush. if you are an experienced leader customer service is is not the place to be in this organization.,Booking.com
111,111,not like it used to be,3.0,great teams. emphasis on personal development. lots of training opportunities. quarterly gettogethers. decent benefits. fun working atmosphere.,terrible pay without any explanation of who were benchmarked against. very little flexibility in schedule. some teams are allowed remote work others are not. once annual trip to amsterdam now scrapped. double standard with many policies. favoritism. inept project managers. career opportunities lacking in certain departments. some managers are great. others love to micromanage.,Booking.com
112,112,a good stepping stone.,3.0,decent pay for the city of orlando for unskilled work. free fruit  apples orange banana and grapes  readily available at all times. free coffee including espresso. massage chairs in the break room. quarterly bonuses based on performance and how much your team lead likes you. fantastically diverse company. you get to talk to people all over the world every day. your co workers teach you every day as they are all from different cultures and speak different languages. they are lenient about performance and give a lot of chances  you really have to screw up your performance to get fired for this. as long as it shows you are trying they will not fire you for performance even if you suck. free parking on premises and those that do not have cars qualify for a hefty travel expense bonus. a constantly changing company that listens to its employees most of the time and changes what needs to be fixed most of the time even if it takes a while. they are constantly trying to engage whether it be with parties spirit days booking.com swag or encouraging posts on the work social media. they usually give you cake on your birthday and frequently attempt to lift spirits with pizza or contests  depending on the team lead . it is a good encouraging company that tries its best but has gotten too big for the attitude it used to have towards employees and is struggling as it has to adapt to the fact its growing too quickly and taking on too many changes. there are ways to move up if you would like to be a senior executive a team lead a quality executive or a customer service manager. this job gave me quite a bit of skills in patience and problem solving. thinking on your feet is essential here and they absolutely give you those skills if you work at it here.,over the time ive worked here i watched it go down hill. when i was first hired we had fab fridays twice a month where the company gave us free food or gifts. we were able to listen to music while working. their motto was numbers dont matter as long as the guest is satisfied. they had a yearly meeting in amsterdam you could be chosen to attend all expense paid that everyone worked towards and if you werent chosen there were parties at your office with games food and gifts. before our eyes we watched this all change. the meeting in amsterdam was discontinued fab fridays faded to one friday a month and then disappeared altogether. music was banned and suddenly it felt every time you turned someone was pushing numbers. the system of bonus structure changed making it harder for employees to get a high bonus if any. you get heavily impacted on your customer satisfaction scores despite the fact that most of the time the guests are rating the hotel or the situation not you. how your lead sees you and how motivated they are to see you get a bonus is how you get one. the pto system is wack. they give a massive amount of pto  a month  however they give it to you all at once and that is all you get. sick pto. vacation pto. emergency pto. you cant ask for days off unpaid you cant give them doctors note to get unpaid days off you cant even give shifts away. you can switch to have days off but thats it. although pto is supposed to be used at the employees discretion booking.com forces you to use yours in order to get a day off at all even when sick. although they have fmla after a year its nearly impossible to get and constantly denied. its a broken system that needs to be fixed as no other company forces hourly employees to take pto for a day off or does not allow them to opt for unpaid days off. even when telling them a year in advance about a vacation if you dont have the pto for whatever reason you will not be able to go or will lose your job. even if you have a doctors note letting them know you physically can not work if you dont have the pto youre either coming in anyway or getting written up. and if you get written up it lasts forever and never falls off. in the long run there is one thing a prospective employee should remember about this job title  it is a call center. it is also the complaints department. you are going to be yelled at. screamed at. blamed. sometimes booking.coms system screws up but they will adamantly deny all responsibility and point fingers at hotels that have no idea how our system works leaving the agent forced to stammer and stutter out excuses to both the guest and the hotel to try to spin blame when we all know really whos fault it is. guests are angry and theyre going to take it out on you. grab your patience your softest most calming voice and get ready. quality and coaching is vastly dependent on the team lead and the quality executive you have. i had several teams during my time and some quality executives would ding me for things others had told me to do. there was no winning unless you hone yourself to exactly what that quality executive wants. the parking is free but lately there have been break ins and a few peoples car windows were smashed. my own tire was slashed in the parking lot. they got extra security but it was like pulling teeth to get it. there are ways to move up but they are so few and far between that the entire building goes for them when they pop up. anywhere outside of your building is barely worth hoping for since youll most likely never get it. all of the good jobs are in amsterdam. its a good job for now. if you cant see yourself in a specific position there its best to get the skills and the name on your resume and go somewhere that will help you grow and excel into higher positions after a while,Booking.com

122,122,customer service guest specialist,1.0,pto is very good about 144 hours a year medical insurance is good aetna offers three programs the third one is free you just contribute money to you hsa account they also contribute 500 a year for single 1000 a year for family paid holidays you get time and a half plus 8 hours of pto or you get double time pay. you also get paid 8 hours if you dont work pay is somewhat reasonable not a living wage in orlando,what began as one of the best jobs ive ever has turned into a complete nightmare. the company initially reaped of benefits and managerial staff had empathy for its employees we had end of the month catering noted as fab fridays for the holidays they would provide food we had an annual all expenses paid trip to amsterdam to learn about the culture and meet global colleagues. flash forward 3 years later our fab fridays are non existent for holidays they request that we the employees contribute the food now theyve eliminated the amsterdam trip and have created a local roadshow. the employee experience has gone from 5 star drastically down to a 1 star rating. something that has shocked a lot of employees because the company is growing exponentially and making tons of money yet the employees benefits have been slowly taken away. another negative of this company is that as it is currently growing trying to become a monster hospitality website it lacks in consistency with its guidelines procedures and even its security guidelines . as a customer service guest specialist rules procedures and important security guidelines change constantly with just an email telling us to review the material and compelling us to learn it ourselves sometimes our team leaders just tell us about the change but they themselves arent given enough time to even study the guidelines and therefore provide effective counsel on such changes. the quality team than reprimands you which in return results in threats by your team lead with performance improvement plans because you didnt adhere to such guidelines. before there would be training sessions for such drastic changes and they would be discussed in workshops these workshops are also nonexistent. the structure for reprimanding employees is inconsistent as higher management doesnt have a proper checks and balances system to ensure that their team leads are treating employees fairly. an example someone that i knew was late every single day for two months and only got a write up he was favored by his team lead yet an agent the other day had 3 late occurrences and got the same level write up. the policies are biased and unfair. the environment at this office has always been encompassed with favoritism what you read in other posts in regards to favoritism is all true. team leaders have favorites on their team and therefore sometimes sanction some differently than they do others and keep in mind that this can also affect you from growing in this company again no consistency. the human resources department is also a joke. they protect the team leads instead of actually listening and investigating the concerns brought to their attention by subordinates. there is nothing kept anonymous as team leads and hr representatives have close bonds. the code of conduct states that retaliation is forbidden but the same employees who reach out to hr in confidence that their concerns will be heard addressed and rectified eventually end up at the bottom of the food chain and well let go or fired for other reasons. strict scrutiny i have come to notice is placed on these employees. human resources does nothing about it for solutions we have to perhaps reach out to amsterdam to get a positive result but i personally am not certain how effective they do their jobs.,Booking.com

150,150,stay away. this toxic workplace will turn you into something else.,2.0,opportunities for growth and moving to different offices. annual trip to amsterdam after the first year a lot of vacation time easy to get time off great insurance and benefit package. 4day shifts,leadership starting from site director to managers are completely unprepared to manage different generations and still believe one formula fits all many senior leaders lack trust and try to lead results via intimidation although the company brag about diversity diversity is not accepted in the grand rapids office. despite all different cultures most leadership are white americans. anyone that doesnt follow leadership blindly get on their blacklist. there is no appreciation for different ideas. education is not valued at all. education is actually feared by small minded leaders task managers. hr department is completely useless. dont ever think about going there about anything. ive seen people be retaliated openly despite annual campaigns and encouragement to report any issues to the compliance team. i have never seen so many negative people in one place. they gossip and complain about everything and everyone all the time in their breaks. booking.com should definitely make better hires. lack of recognition for anything. no recognition at all for any efforts. quick to call everyone out in general meetings but almost impossible to recognize anything. everything going in the wrong direction. i wouldnt be surprise if this whole place closes within 2 years or so.,Booking.com

176,176,so much potential....,3.0,booking philosophy is meant to provide a great employee experience. even the follow up with annual surveys regular training and communications is phenomenal. the benefits are great and the senior leadership has a great mission.,the follow through is the issue. what you do with the information that is provided there are way to many inexperienced managers that are driven by numbers only and increasing their own earning potential almost to a lack of concern for the employees. this is a morale killer. booking promotes from with in almost to a fault. many of the employees that are promoted lack practical business experience.,Booking.com

211,211,a  company which is growing and straggling and make you maturing and straggling,2.0,if you are curious about data it is the right place to go. no matter what roles you are you have the access to the massive amount of data and you can learn and use it in your own area in discussion etc. basically anything in the company scoepe bring you data show your points. you have the flexibility to change teams under some conditions. plenty social activitities are oranganized by the company. fair salary good relocation package. in the center of amsterdam,your job is to finish small tasks fast optimizating for exiting product conversation is center of almost everything you do not every thing but almost. promotion is evaluated mostly by your visibility for various roles you need to fight your place shout out loud make the right friends. of course you need be good at your job to certain extend. but remember you need to be positive and fight for your own promotion or sometimes you are lucky some people would like to do it for you. i challenge you the most mentioned word in the company. no matter you have a complain suggestion idea this is most common response you hear. it is not wrong to challenge it is good for things that is part your job. but for everything hum it has became an easy way to push responsibility to others especially for managers to give away blames. for those task which is far away from your responsibility be prepared and strong directly ask back why dont you take challenge it is your job push anything from button to top is difficlt. at the same time dont expect too much from management you want something do it yourself push yourself it is your own responsibility again dont have to high expectations of the results.,Booking.com
212,212,grand rapids cc,5.0,the people the people the people. every day that i get into work im blown away by the great people that i work with. we have people from all walks of life that band together to bring success to booking.coms collections. the current management team provides every opportunity for personal development and encourage out of the box thinking. this department isnt for everyone though  if you are slow to adapt and unwilling to work as a team you may want to look elsewhere. negative reviews on here for this department likely stem from those who were not quick to adapt and outwardly talked poorly about their colleagues. there are often travel opportunities that take you all over the us and canada even overseas to amsterdam. there is an onsite gym 401k matching and fresh fruits and vegetables every day. there are many other pros but if i started listing them id likely never stop.,the hr team members are rarely on the same page. ive had multiple instances where i receive one answer from someone and the complete opposite answer from another. there is an obvious lack of support and no one really seems to know what theyre doing... it causes for extreme frustration for everyone. there is also little room for growth if you assimilate growth with promotions. however there is plenty of opportunity for personal and professional growth that can help you set yourself up for future promotions.,Booking.com
213,213,the best company ive had the pleasure of working for.,5.0,i recently left booking after working there for almost a year in our seattle office however i have nothing but great things to say about this company. the reason i left was because of some restructuring that heavily impacted our office and i felt like we lost a lot of what made our culture there so great but that doesnt change my outlook on the company. as an employee i always felt respected trusted and valued by management and the company in general. i felt like i had the ability to make a noticeable impact on an enormous company and that the work i did never went unappreciated. booking is one of the few places that i can say with confidence genuinely cares about each individual working for them and they prove that by investing in their people listening to feedback and following up with any concerns. they treat their people like well people instead of just some cogs in a machine. the company itself is very flat which i loved. the leadership is really involved and the managers at least in my experience always had their teams best interests in mind and did their best to communicate everything with us. there was a good level of transparency compared to other companies although there is still room for improvement in that area. the work i did felt challenging fun and exciting. it was right where i wanted to be where i was directly making an impact on our products and our customers. there is a lot of opportunity to move around quite easily and get experience in a lot of difference aspects of the company. in general i didnt feel like there was a lack of growth opportunities and i felt that movement was always encouraged. perhaps the greatest parts of booking are its culture and its environment. its young fast paced diverse and really welcoming. there is a lot going on all the time and there are opportunities to meet and connect with people from all over the world. bam their annual company party is a great example of the companys effort in maintaining its culture and morale. they even offer to bring you to amsterdam once a quarter. overall i really miss working here. if it werent for the restructuring that happened to our office i would have stayed for the foreseeable future. i really enjoyed the people i worked with my managers our office our happy hoursoffice gatherings the people i met and everything else in between. if you get an opportunity to work here take it.,there really arent a ton of cons that i can think of. the biggest gripe i had was working with perl and sometimes feeling like some of the technologies used were a little dated. it was never a deal breaker though because there is room to grow in other areas as well. another con for me personally was our office mostly moving out of seattle but i understand that things like this could happen anywhere due to business necessities. i think the company handled the transition well enough and was generous throughout but maybe could have provided a little more warning.,Booking.com

222,222,worse company award,1.0,the only pro for booking.com is the diversity. nothing else.,the internal communication is fail with divergent info in each department and between departments as well. hr and director knows about the problems but they prefer to ignore what happens. they dont really care for employees. hr usually close tickets opened by employees without solve the problem. is really frustrating. if you get sick and need to request pto you run the rick to have your pto denied because doesnt matter the reason you have to tell hr 24 hours in advance that you need pto. depending of your team leader she is going to say that you can not use the bathroom in the first or last hour of work you have also to have printscreen of everything that you do because your team leader can decrease your worked ours without your knowledge besides say that you checkedin late even if you were there on time but could not login due technical issues. they want you to work on your breaks and lunch. turnover is extremely high. must people dont hold the job for more than 6 weeks. in the interviews and during career fairs is said that employees can apply to other positions in the company in 6 months. however that is not true. minimum time is 1 year unless you are an exception in other words if you have great contacts and your team leader really wants to help you. no booking.com for me anymore.,Booking.com

237,237,theres more than meets the eye when it comes to their culture.,1.0,amazing recruiting staff  best ive ever worked with. same for the quality and training group  best of the best. wonderful cse and tl staff. collaborative supportive highly motivated positive. extremely diverse. my impression is the company itself and other offices in this region and globally may not have the same issues that are prevalent in the seattle office. at least not to the same extent as many employees have transferred and report much better circumstances.,csm staff and higher tout and demand the culture reputation be paraded daily but it reveals itself often to be a carefully crafted facade. get behind closed doors and it can be brutally toxic. if you come with any past leadership or call center management experience leave it at the door it will only cause you pain. employees are appreciated for being completely moldable with no experience knowledge suggestions ideas or questions. pay was recently increased across the board for this site but is still famously below comparable companies and not a living wage for seattle area especially for cse entry level. management has a lot of behind closed doors anxiety and pressure about the attrition and poaching by other seattle area companies including right within the same corporate complex. teams are managed with unclear expectations and at times goals and expectations that are unreachable especially for the evening teams. call center reps are always under incredible pressure but this site manages team metrics and expectations particularly poorly and inconsistently. for example  the csat survey. many centers can take into consideration survey feedback that is clearly unrelated to the agents service by pulling those scores from the reporting. not here. there is a lot of time and effort put into the appearance of managing to company values vs. kpis  however its heavily kpi driven just quietly. really confusing and so hard to manage teams and motivate people when the goals are clear as mud. demoralizing and stressful to say the least and opens the door to management massaging and manipulating the results and the quarterly performance reviews  and the quarterly bonuses. zero checks and balances accountability or consistency.,Booking.com

239,239,you cant be yourself doesnt recommend.,1.0,bonuses were very helpful usually between 8  16 but to get a good bonus you will have to suck up into your manager also the almighty has to like you or you are done.,you cant be yourself  be who your manager wants you to be. a company totally high school oriented where it counts if you are popular and not the stats numbers. useless philosophy. they hire managersteam leads with no experience or personality because theyre very mold and will just follow ridiculous orders. they categorize the employees or you do what they want you to do and they like you for being a follower or you are done and dont even think on moving up in the company if you are not sucking up your team lead or manager or if you think different or if you are not popular forget it it doesnt matter if your stats are great its all about being popular and to be the chosen one....,Booking.com

241,241,the only benefit is the pay,2.0,bonuses were very helpful usually between 8  16 but youll have to get on your team leads nice side. the pay is good but in the location bellevue wa others offer much higher. spirit days and fab fridays were fun but they never offered a variety of food and it can be boring too. nothing more special than other companies. other offices especially noncustomeraccommodation service really like their jobs... they get more benefits and arent treated like children who need to be constantly watched. the ceo and other executives higher up on the ladder are really nice amsterdam trip for almost 25 of the company based on tenure,you cant be yourself  be who your manager wants you to be. you have to really suck up to the higher ups or you wont go anywhere. they hire managersteam leads with no experience  assuming because theyre very moldable and dont have a preconceived idea of how to actually treatmanage others. they categorize the workers to focus on some and not the others  if you werent chosen by the almighty ones youll probably stay in your position for a good while. work hard constantly but still no reward other than bonuses but my bonuses were rarely based on my performance. they expect you to answer 8 calls in an hour with only 25 seconds between each. if you can do it but dont suck up or fall into their mold you get a pat on the back or maybe some chocolate and a balloon... other than this reward your work goes unnoticed. i was a strong team player and had very good statistics but was constantly told that i wasnt meeting the standard of the team rather than the standard of the goals set by corporate. managers dont resolve issues they sweep it under the rug go straight to hr with issues. sometimes hr isnt helpful though either  they will erase any proof you have of any claim for example the hr site may say they offer a benefit but if you ask theyll take it down and act as if it never existed. their values are unclear and leaves management unsure of how to lead. the values dont seem to be important and is definitely doesnt align with the atmosphere of the work place. some team leads yell at you if you get out of your seat. it seems they lack respect and an understanding that we are actual adults with actual working brains.,Booking.com

247,247,toxic environment,2.0,the diversity is amazing free coffee free fruit and all the free junk food you could want access to a gym in the building great team lead group one good manager.,its been a few months since ive left and its really become apparent how toxic the office environment is there. team leads are exploited for their labor  they are salary but all the benefit of that arrangement goes to the company team leads still have to work crazy shifts holidays precious little flexibility vacations denied for silly reasons it is looked down on to request comp time for meetings outside of shiftovertime. there should be some benefit to the employee when moving to salary but its clear that the company was just looking for unpaid overtime and thats the focus. although i will say that at the time i left they were making baby steps and allowing tls to take half days from time to time and comp time if our overtime hours became excessive although this was open to interpretation by direct managers  that is how it should be so good on them there was also a weird amount of competition between some of the tls that was encouraged from the top  rather than working together toward common goals it was very much about getting ahead at any cost. this resulted in more than one really tense meeting with people shouting  quite bizarre in a professional environment and wholly unnecessary. some tls did thrive in that kind of environment  if youre a competitive person by nature or prefer to work individually over teamwork this could be a great fit for you. it was also a bit disturbing how the unspoken expectation was for every employee to have the same personality  employees were indeed evaluated on this quarterly the company values which are great on paper were often interpreted as teamwork  loud and talkative and this was also a consideration for who to promote internally. if you already fit into this mold great if you are at all reservedreflective this will likely be viewed as a flaw. there was also quite a bit of mixed messaging around metrics  although we were told that the focus was moving toward coaching to the right behaviors there was still in practice a huge amount of pressure to meet metrics. this was confusing and made it difficult to manage teams. additionally i didnt feel particularly protected as an employee  it seemed the agents were able to speak to us however they wanted with no recourse. dont get me wrong  most of the agents were so wonderful and im not so thin skinned that i cant take standard criticism between a team lead and their direct report but when i start to feel unsafe being alone in the same room as one of my agents there needs to be some recourse or protection for the tl. my impression that a lot of these issues are unique to the bellevue office. booking is a great company overall they do great things and really work hard to support their employees and make it a great place to work.,Booking.com

299,299,recommended for singles only,4.0,more so than customer service youre actually playing the 3rd party or middle ground between hotel and guests who booked through booking.com. the normal phone calls consists of cancel reservation requests to answering questions about the hotel the potential guest are trying to book. there is a set of procedure you need to follow regarding complaints so if you memorize and know it well this job is no challenge at all.,i enjoyed working at this place but the attendant policy was too overwhelming. the company uses a pointformula where youre basically given 6 points to lose until youre terminated. for every time you call in you get a point taken away. if you happen to call in on a weekend when youre scheduled you lose two points. you can absolutely regain your points but youd have to have perfect attendance no tardy or absence for 30days in order to gain back one point. ridiculously when you get 3 points taken away your team leader would ask you for a oneonone talk and basically warns you on whats going to happen if you keep losing points. also you are basically put on a probation for 1 month until you gain back your point to drop it down to 2. what probation means is that you cannot bid to change your schedule or even consider changing departmentpromotion opportunities.,Booking.com

311,311,the pros do not out weigh the cons,2.0,alot of training in fun places. i was able to travel to several different major cities and meet great new people nice offices opportunity to go to amsterdam 12 times a year depending on your level,unfortunately their are quite a few the pay is incredible low compared to the industry and competitors.most of the trainings i went to with other employees we continually talked about how we could be making substantially more at the major competitor mid level manager are absolutely terrible. i was overachieving all targets which is incredibly rare and was scolded multiple times about not making enough outbound phone calls. all you can offer to your partners is more discounts or the option to pay more. with the current state of the hotel industry this is the last thing they want to do. the companyall otas are in a very turbulent time and i would not want to be around one in the next 5 years their really isnt much career growth here. they tell you everything is flat so their are no many steps to the top. thats not what young professionals want to hear who want to climb the ladder. company has a lot of side steps not steps up also travel benefit is terrible for a travel company. half of the employees do not use it as they still have connections to old hotel chains and can get better rates. way to many accounts are given to certain account managers. the expectation is that you talk to all of your top accounts once a quarter. this is impossible when you have over 850. as many of these accounts have not been talked to and once you do they will always want contact. finally they constantly ask for feedback but never want to hear it. we address many of these points in a engagement survey. when these point were brought up management turned it back around on us instead of communicating up the ladder of how it could be improved.,Booking.com
312,312,good place to work,5.0,freedom to create and innovate. knowledgable and flexible management and colleagues. possibility to travel occasionally. good nonsalary benefits and nice atmosphere.,limited room for internal growth. there are no other cons about booking.com as they provide you with all you need.,Booking.com
313,313,great for a student andor first job not for experienced professionals,2.0,easy job free snacks trips swag. this is what keeps people here. the office is massive and has an upbeat millennial vibe.,no communication those in leadership kissed their way there high school atmosphere unprofessional in appearance and attitude. the majority of team leads try to intimidate you and your performance is based on your behavior and relationships with middle management.,Booking.com
314,314,great,5.0,amazing experience i learned so much about the hotel industry.,i cant say i really had any.,Booking.com
315,315,interviewing,5.0,i love the multicultural and diverse environment,i do not have any to mention at this time,Booking.com
316,316,accommodation service executive,1.0,bonuses every quarter on average 400 after taxes.,terrible company. you are expected to take call after call and listen to complaints all day and have no tools to resolve the issues. it makes you feel terrible knowing that the caller needs help right away and you cant help them at all. you have your lunch and two breaks and if you need to use the restroom any other time too bad. dont work here the yearly trip to amsterdam is not worth especially because you are there working. its not a vacation as they make it sound.,Booking.com
317,317,wonderful environment,4.0,everyone is friendly and willing to help you as an intern. your goal is there to learn and that is exactly what they want you to do. everything is provided and your work is usually split between you and another fulltimer.,there are some people who have a very radical way of thinking when it comes to what is appropriate for work conversation. unfortunately nothing can really be done about the situation even if they were talked to. the company is growing and sometimes your ability to work out weighs your affect on the workplace.,Booking.com
318,318,love this company,5.0,great friendly environment. booking.com is a company that truly cares about their employees. after the 6.12.16 tragedy in orlando booking team members from all parts of the world joined together in solidarity and the management team did whatever they could to support the staff. we are a company built on giving and receiving feedback and really using it to help us grow. there are always the one offs who arent happy but those people will never be happy anywhere. this is a company that truly cares pays well and is growing year over year while still making sure the entry level employees are heard and the customer is the focus in all things we do booking gets involved in the community as well. i have been in call centers for many years and can say without a doubt that booking is one of a kind and a great place to build or continue your career,not really a con per say but with growth comes change so we are going through a lot of change. anyone wishing to work here needs to be open to change.,Booking.com
319,319,great company very new.,5.0,benefits are great great people nice and happy atmosphere. company cares about their employees,career growth is very limited.,Booking.com
320,320,bookin.com is a great place to work,4.0,benefits are some of the most competitive in the market and i have worked for several major employers team members are provided with free fruit catered lunches annual trips to amsterdam and a senior management team that surveys and takes time to listen to the employees and implements change. the work stations are truly ergonomic and allow for employees to work in standing positions as well.,i personally can not think of one downside i am respected and paid for work done. yes i would love to make more money however this is the deal i signed up for and b.com has held up their end of the deal. there is a lot to manage and some of the floor supervisor expectations should be automated. at times it is a challenge to get everything done.,Booking.com
321,321,very motivating,5.0,great environment friendly great workplace good salary good training,no complaints so far it is perfect.,Booking.com
322,322,not for 35  over business professionals,2.0,domestic  global travel annual christmas gifts. candidates spend 1 to years max here for a resume builder then move on it will be better for you and for the company as usually around 3 years employee dissatisfaction kicks in at an alarming pace.,unqualified managers who lack business acumen  professionalism in dressing a try to bully mgmt style  so college grads consult your parents or mentors on hr rules for your state when accepting this role no management support and aggressive quotas based on unrealistic job objectives  not for seasoned sales professionals. if your are an inspiring entrepreneur this opportunity will reinforce why you will go into business for yourself. if you are a corporate fanatic this opportunity will better hone down the culture and environment best suited for corporate upward mobility as this company does not believe in that. applicants who are in their youth be very discerning when working here. they do not pay for talents so offering your gifts and showcasing them here gets you more work with fake titles that do not in anyway translate into an outside company. there is not an area manager who worked for this organization that is an area manager at another company or even a senior manager as they are only qualified for this role in this culture not in another company.,Booking.com
323,323,csr,3.0,lots of perks and free stuff. daily free fruit and other foods. great team environment.,scheduling is horrible often stuck for 6mo or longer.,Booking.com

325,325,if youre young and not into money its fun for a while.,2.0,i made some good friends going to amsterdam for training is fun once or twice  then its not fun and certainly not worth sacrificing a lot of money  which youre likely giving up by working here. traveling is cool and if you have a desirable territory its really cool for a while. if you do not itll be a challenge but try to make the best of it. i do credit booking.com with teaching me a lot  running successful meetings selling upselling managing accounts  i achieved all of this and i appreciate that.,this is a mediocre place to work and itll never be more. however much they preach the importance of the ees employee engagement survey the company will not change in order to boost morale. the company gets very mediocre scores on the survey each year employees on average rate it a 710 or so but when it comes to compensation the company gets murdered as it should. management will act surprised and send out an email stating theyre going to do market research to determine the average that someone with the title account manager makes and then you may get a 200 per year raise wow nice or youll never hear about it again. despite darren huston now the former ceo claiming we have millions of dollars in the bank and also having enough for countless acquisitions somehow the company cant afford to pay a decent wage in some of the most expensive cities in the us. year after year youll hear outlandish claims like booking.com wants to be the best place in the world to work. the problem is that becoming the best in anything school sports any profession etc. takes investment. it takes time money effort etc. booking.com literally changes nothing despite claiming this every year. its offensive and sad. the pay is disastrous and quite embarrassing actually. a market manager at booking.coms biggest competitor expedia makes more than an area manager at booking.com and an area manager manages a team of people managers who manage market managers. each year forbes releases a list of the average starting salary for recent college grads in major us cities  its very sad but this list often times proves that new college grads  21 22 year olds make more than an account manager at booking.com after 5 years. an am of 5 years gets an annual merit increase of about 5001k per year  thats 12 and doesnt quite cover the cost of inflation  for you econ majors. lastly  despite what a recruiter might tell you the bonus potential is absolutely poor. if you hit 110 to target every single quarter your total bonus amount will equal close to 6000  thats annual  not every 3 months. i know this because its happened. 6000 might actually be generous too.,Booking.com
326,326,not worth for me,3.0,a cool place to work beautiful office. paid training for one month. free trip to amsterdam after one year of employment.,mandatory extra hours during busy seasons. no perspective to grow as an employee. not a challenging job. poor senior managment.,Booking.com

335,335,good corporate company,4.0,does a good job of promoting company culture tries to be fun and has a young energetic vibe to certain aspects of management. i think the company does a decent job of promoting a positive call center environment however the nature of call center work itself can be tedious at times. good training effective team leadership.,as a customer service executive pay is low and productivity requirements are rather high. schedules are not very flexible. transparency about fulltime benefits and schedules lacked until formal entry training was complete.,Booking.com

339,339,management is the worst...,3.0,fun company party in amsterdam once a year... but thats about it.,management is a nightmare. people are promoted based on how long theyve been at the company. it doesnt matter how hard you work or how good you are at your job if youre not sucking up or increasing your visibility it doesnt matter. people who have questionable work ethics get promoted to management and it really unmotivates everyone. also raises are a joke... you get a 1 increase every year. salary is not negotiable either.,Booking.com

353,353,little direction from senior managers,3.0,friendly place to work growing company creative products and,goals are often unrealistic and there are factors outside of employees control that can impact them. salary is low compared to similar roles in same industry senior managers can do a better job of supporting and escalating issues internally to solve problems. there is a ceiling to growth as there are not many opportunities to move up unless people move or leave.,Booking.com
354,354,needs to stop throwing free goodies at employees and just listen to them instead. used to be a great place to work.,1.0,bonus every quarter if you meet requirements which has changed a lot free coffee tea and fruit good health dental and vision insurance.,salary is not competitive and is actually less than most call centers. the company has grown a lot the past year and management has not handled it well. people that have been working there for years have been screwed over for promotions as they keep bringing in underqualified people from outside of the company. you really have no voice there if you are just an agent or anything else really. their demands have changed a lot and they often talk about how our voice matters and ladida but its really all talk. it used to be a great place to work and you really felt a sense of belonging. but now it is a struggle just to get through the day  especially when your supervisor came from outside the company and knows nothing about the work you do that they are supposed to be supervising. keep in mind that i worked at the grand rapids mi office. i watched the company change a lot over the last few years and the grand rapids office is definitely seen as the ugly cousin of all of the other offices now. procedures are not the same in all offices worldwide so you are often left cleaning up other peoples laziness. it is quite sad because the company used to be so great and still has so much potential but the leaders are just playing a guessing game at what works best  there is no actual thought process. so many people have been forced out the past year  it is insane. you cannot go one work week without hearing another person got let go. its really quite sad. my opinion  they need to stop giving out all of the free stuff to their employees and just listen to them it would probably be a cheaper option than to bribe them with all of these gifts and goodies.,Booking.com

361,361,cse,2.0,some great people i meet while working here. learned my lesson about big corporations.,managment is terrible. they changed the way your performance will be rated all the time as they can not even figure out accurate way of tracking the performance for individual agent. quality control tells you you are doing good but if surveys are not coming back positive 83 of the time your out of game. it doesnt really matter if survey was related to you or not. generic answers from tl when you question accuracy of their system. while we were able to promote our own surveys via emails it was easier to get across what this survey is about but that was not in their best interest as they want to keep rotating people and have new employees through manpower so they can cut off the cost of benefits bonuses and salaries. they let go so many people in the last year many of them have been working for long time here and not because they were lazy but simply because managment and qc is lazy to analyze the actual work you do.,Booking.com
362,362,good at frist,2.0,there are lots of travel benefitssuch as annual trips to amsterdam,there is a pretty high turnover rate and there seems to be a burnout rate of 45 years. upper management asks for feedback and input for employees but they really dont want to hear anything other than everyone is happy and everything is great. pay is below industry average,Booking.com

376,376,they try really hard to camouflage the negatives of working here.,3.0,they offer adequate compensation and have very nice benefits including quarterly bonuses. after one year of employment there are a lot opportunities for advancement.,they promise you a schedule in the phone interview and then give you something totally different once youre in training. they are not flexible at all when it comes to the schedule. the training program is 5 weeks long but it doesnt mean much as they change the system so often. there was a major change in the system the day after we were trained on it and all they said was get used to change. there is nothing special about you at booking.com. no matter how hard you work or how high your csat customer satisfaction is you are completely replaceable. the most you get for excelling in csat is a pat on the back and a 25 gift card once in a great while. your employment is solely dependent on your csat score. this is determined by a survey sent to customers via email after contact with you. more often than not your dissatisfied surveys are due to the situation and not your service but there is no way to dispute this. even if the guest leaves a comment that praises the you highly but clicks dissatisfied by mistake it still counts as a negative score. they constantly promote team effort and reiterate how important it is to work with your team but there are no opportunities to do so. every score that affects you directly is individual and the overall team score only affects your team leaders bonus. the senior line is the line that you call when you need help in a situation or a customer requests to speak to the manager. we are constantly told that we call them too much and that we need to look at the procedure guidelines before calling but i sat next to them and i watch them goof off and watch youtube videos all day. finally the team leads. im sure not all of them are as bad as mine but mine was ridiculous. she tells us to call her when we need help but she is never at her desk. in the one on one feedback sessions there was no feedback just the same goal reiterated. before our quarterly review she asked that we tell her what we think our strengths and weaknesses are. on my review she copied and pasted my email to her. literally made me review myself and added nothing to it.,Booking.com
377,377,horrible,1.0,the fitness center which i never used. i guess trips if you get to go and overtime pay if needed.,all bad they are not transparent about being a manpower employees in the initial application then they lie and say you will get hired in then one day just fire you through manpower  end your assignment . dont believe them anything they tell you. favoritism runs high and unprofessional office relationships,Booking.com
378,378,poor management,1.0,the company touts great customer service focus on employees and worklife balance. most employees are nice hard working people that care about each other and the customers. the offices are clean modern and well designed.,the pay is lousy for the work and not at all competitive. there are countless empty promises of career development even if you are a top performer and exceed all metrics. people that have the worst work performance and terrible attitudes get promoted because management likes them. this is a highly political working environment with the best talent quick to leave once they figure out that the poor attitude trickles down from poor top and middle management.,Booking.com
379,379,cse  bellevue. do not do this job with this company.,1.0,training the trainers the recruiters and the other cses. training was truly the greatest part of this whole journey. i joined in march 2015 and in retrospect the only redeeming part of this whole job was my trainer. she got pulled away to help a later class and was pulling crazy hours but still put all of her effort into making sure we had a good experience. that trainer and i have both since left the company but i will always be grateful for her enthusiasm and true love for what she was doing. if i find another training and trainer like that i consider myself very lucky. outside of that the other pros were health insurance options and coverage. the recruiting team is also a class act.,horrible management sycophant team leads and a favoritism system. leadership drives out good people if they find them threatening. there are so many people in this center simply going through the motions. its so obvious that no one here really cares anymore. the number of people leaving is extremely high. no one wants to stay because they are not motivated to stay. the spirit team does little to actually instill spirit and none of the motivating events are actually motivating. people are fake. team leads kiss butt all day every day. most are never at their desk and if they are they are too busy to help you. honestly if you can avoid working here avoid it. if this is only option pay attention in training and be on time to the second.,Booking.com

385,385,good to see the horrible reviews still exist,1.0,nothing. there is nothing pro about this company.,more than a year later and still my former position is still open. justified that losers still dont have a clue on what a good employee is. a good employee isnt there to kiss butt and gossip. a good employee is there to do their job. now with a better paying job with a healthier atmosphere im not sure how i survived for more than a year working at an insane asylum with managers still coming out of diapers office managers telling lies from another office in another city jealous much and mindless weekly calls about nothing but how to do a job instead of taking that hour and doing the job. oh lest not forget how they set you up with these personality test so they can accuse you of things they claim you are due to a fake test. anyone who really knows the laws of human resources should know that every person has a right to deny such testing without fear or reprisal. im not sure how this company is still surviving with such low ethics. i mean below six feet under. how sad is that anyone who has been fortunate enough to get out of this place now knows the true experience of a professional work environment with employers who know the laws of human resources. i feel sorry for anyone who accepts employment thinking they found a great job with super awesome people. its definitely a cult environment with people trying to escape as soon as they get the chance. you are lucky if they do the escaping for you by letting you go. however i will never forget the terrible and abusive experience i had there.,Booking.com
386,386,favoritism in orlando,2.0,you meet people from different cultures.,ops managers who plays favoritism in the orlando office. constantly shoving in your face how to search the system to see how we can fire someone. does not know how to communicate to others and one particular ops who is always sticking their nose in everything. worst ops managers ever. promote who they want and nominate who they want for awards without sticking to the core values as the team leads are expected too. they are a joke.,Booking.com
387,387,cse the last job on earth you will ever want,3.0,free parking lot free orca for public commuters free fruits free starbucks coffee 8 types of coffee drinks great view from the office bonuses per quarter health benefits allowances for booking hotels on booking.com genius member benefits on booking.com free company trip to headquarter amsterdam fun events potluck games etc. overtime opportunities free tazo teas ping pong table.. if you are stuck looking for a right job for you this is a great position temporarily. at least you have a job until you find one.,starting from what is behind pros of this company free fruits but most of time they are being rotten if you work on weekends you dont get fruits at all sometimes bonuses but your personality have to be approved  by management to get qualified for bonuses after they evaluate it im talking about your personality not your performance so youd better play it right when you get hired opinions can be perceived as negative attitude. oh if you are introverts the management may think you are being unfriendly with your coworkers therefore you may not get bonuses you deserve fun events potluck games etc. but potlucks has to be brought out of your pocket if you do not attend this management may think you are not being friendly with your coworkers. if you bring premade stuff from a store people dont eat them and you are pretty much wasting 1020 bucks just for that event also you still have to work as scheduled overtime opportunities but most of time it is limited please dont count on this. ping pong table but dont get fooled by funenvironmentlookingoffice. when a recruiter shows you around the office. if you want to know if cses are really liking and enjoying their work then talk to them directly. other cons remember this is customer service job after all. yes yes you will encounter very rude people on the phone every single day. i cried on my first day. there are very limited number of promotion changes. lots of people leave at the end very high turnover rate. cse positions are for people who dont have any other job opportunities seriously. everyone at cafeteria talks about how they are looking for other jobs right now. management tells you not to use cellphone on the floor for security purpose to protect customers credit card details but your team leaders are smirking texting god who knows whowhat on their smartphones while you are trying to find a hotel for the guest who just lost their reservation because the hotel was overbooked and needs a room right now. then your team leader will kindly tell you later that you were not being that productive. if one of your colleagues confront your team leader about their cell phones do not expect that our opinion will matter or change the mindset of the management. remember you cannot change a thing when it comes to a management. do not have opinions dont be honest with the management just act as if you are super happy to be there just for your own sake. play cards right. it doesnt matter how hard you are trying to get better at what you do the management will still make you feel like you are not good enough for their team if your numbers are not great. most importantly please do not get sick. i know its almost 2016 and we live in usa but please do not get sick and miss work if you dont want to get terminated once your penalty points are accumulated up to 3. please note your doctors note does not matter.,Booking.com
388,388,dont even do it,1.0,i enjoy working for a company that works in the travelhospitality sector. the pto is pretty great on us standards 23 days although any sick leave is taken out of those days as well. the occasional travel to headquarters in amsterdam can also be nice. the insurance and 401k are ok as well. if you land a role in an upper management position then this could be a good company.,the pay horribly and they have very little focus or attention given to retaining talent. there are also very few career growth opportunities except in the hq in amsterdam but unfortunately europeans are favored for those roles because they do not require relocation or visas. americans are especially less likely to get hired for roles in amsterdam because even though they pay horribly here they pay even less there and americans require higher salaries than locals in amsterdam. all employees are sent to amsterdam for the allcompany meeting in the winter and they tote this as a perk but dont kid yourself  flying across the world for a 2 day event and having to fly directly back and having to spend the majority of those two days in a conference center in windowless rooms granted with a party at the end is no perk at all. morale is also incredibly low especially in the office that i work in but this doesnt seem to be an issue for management as nothing is done to improve the workplace despite having received feedback from employees on what could be improved.,Booking.com
389,389,if you dont need to...dont.,2.0,some great people work at booking.com. quarterly bonus is nice is you qualify for it. the workspace is ergonomic. im struggling here to find many pros.,quarterly bonus is based on metrics that keep changing which wouldnt be a problem except no one in the company has figured out a way to measure the metrics your bonus is based on and the whole process is weighted against you. lots of favoritism from the top down. if you dont play the kiss up game you dont advance in the company. that is the bottom line. very little opportunity for advancement in customer sevice. company demands flexibility and adherence to their policies but is completely inflexible when considering requests for shift modifications..either temporarily or permanently. overtime is often mandated during peak seasons. pay is below standard for the type of job and location. company has no consideration for work life balance and management acts like you ought to be lucky that you even have a job.,Booking.com
390,390,please avoid if you can,1.0,the only pro i can think of is that if you use public transit the local bellevue office offers an orca bus pass.  they do offer hotel reimbursement if you use booking.com to reserve  but thats about it.,consider it slave labor. dont expect anything. youre over worked underpaid and under appreciated. if you bring this up they will let you know they appreciate you with a balloon.  like they did back in kindergarten.  if you use up your break time or personal time you do not get any other time for such things as restroom stops.  they dont offer sick days youre required to take pto  and if you dont have any available you borrow the pto from the future bringing you negative  meaning you have to make it up.  you cant be late or theyll use pto time to make up for that time.  you get written up for everything all the time.  this list goes on.,Booking.com

394,394,have the courage to go elsewhere,2.0,potlucks and small onsite gym. they take you to amsterdam at least once year but you have to work. great benefits.,they post your productivity so if youre not the best they make sure that everyone knows. their call handling time is very unrealistic. this is a high stress job a lot of people that call in are stupid and dont read the policies before they make a reservation. your breaks are very short and scheduled. the team leads do not want to help they want you to deescalate a call so that they dont have to take it. everything is constantly changing and not all of management can agree upon the correct procedure. no cell phones are allowed but you see management on them all of the time. do not be 1 minute late literally they will give you points. they care about how many calls you take and not the quality of handling the call. this job is micro managed and definitely not worth the stress. forget having a life or trying to get time off. the morale is like being in a factory all day except you are at a desk.,Booking.com
395,395,good bad and the ugly.,3.0,lots of training free food bonuses trips to amsterdam for those interested free swag culture. never a dull moment. keeps you on your toes. great for entry customer service gaining skills.,long and tiring hours very little down time or personal time favoritism by management unhappy agents unhappy customers...lots of complaints from people all around the world. its all on your shoulders. promotions are near impossible if youre not a kiss up even if you have consistently shown to be a great employee with high numbers and drive to advance. if youre not a social butterfly say goodbye to ever going anywhere in this company and getting no help. booking.com doesnt feel like a long term place to work. i was there 3 years nearly and had 4 interviews to advance to another position and was constantly turned down. i left because i was tired of the rat race.,Booking.com

398,398,customer service executive,3.0,pleasant organizational culture supervisors coach you on effective ways to address customer and hotel concerns opportunity to help others who are having issues with their hotel accomodations,dealing with rude customers and accommodations. this position requires a lot of patience. there were times when i answered the phone and would immediately be cursed out by disgruntled employees or owners of accommodations limited opportunities to advance at this site,Booking.com
399,399,account manager  sf,5.0,in my experience this role was one of the most challenging opportunities. most tools you use are built internally so even though every employee has to start from scratch when hired from understanding the logic of their tooling you understand the company better as a whole. this company runs on change and ab testing so for someone who likes procedure and strict structure this might not be the organization for you. but for someone who likes to feel like they have a voice at their company someone who appreciates executive transparency and for someone who thrives as an independent worker then this company and role may be a great fit. my favorite part of the role was that i was the ceo of my own market and designed my strategies of how to optimize the performance of my partners based on my knowledge and observation. i felt empowered by my management to take challenges head on and not be afraid to fail which is refreshing for such a large corporation. it is a plus if you are a quick thinker but the company provides tremendous support to help you educate and build your skillset within the role. lots of opportunity for upward mobility within the company especially those who do not mind moving across offices and even countries sometimes,time prioritization is a must. if you do not have a hearty work ethic then you may not like the environment.,Booking.com
400,400,account manager in sf,5.0,being an account manager in san francisco is awesome. the people i work with every day motivate me more than i ever thought i could be motivated in an office setting. coming from a huge tech company prior i assumed real teamwork sort of goes out the window when you work for such an internet giant. booking.com proved me wrong. this is a true team here everyone genuinely wants each other to succeed. my colleagues take time out of their day to help with everything under the sun literally every day. we provide a great product to both hotels and to guests that i stand behind and never have to question. oh yeah did i mention travel we travel to beautiful destinations in california to visit our hotel partners and strengthen the mutual partnership regularly. the learning is endless here we are encouraged to attend trainings at different offices to better our professional and personal development as individuals. it will sound cheesy when i say this but i wear my booking.com backpack every day to and from work with pride. it should also be noted that our snacks are both delicious and healthy.,lengthy rampup. i have been here about 5 months and am just finally starting to get the hang of the technology and tools we utilize.,Booking.com
401,401,customer executive ii,1.0,at one time booking.com orlando was a great place to work it was a family a customer service center not a typical u.s. call center. the guest was the priortity and internal advancement was open to all employees.,unfortunately booking.com orlando has become that dreaded u.s. call center. regardless of how you treat the guest with the best service possible the metrics are all that matter. the csat customer survey is not applicable just to the cse but the cse is held accountable for the survey even if it has nothing to do with their proformance and if the survey is low then you are written up on a 90 day write up for a 30 day metrics report. completely unfair to the cse  upper management does not seem to care or take this into consideration. i have worked for bookng.com for 2yrs. i was in love with my job it was a family but now i hate getting out of bed and going to work. think about it when 80 employees are fired in one month for no good reason just because upper management feels they are not being productive although they are and have been the original staff that has helped with bring booking.com to the u.s. status it currently is in. there is no consideration for the employee this is when you know that you need to leave and not refer anyone to work at booking.com because you do not want for this unhappiness to happen to anyone else.,Booking.com
402,402,no room for progression,1.0,good coffee beautiful lunch room view decent benefits.,its a boys club. if the management boys dont like you or think you cant be controlled by them you wont go anywhere  you will completely stagnate. there is no room for progression unless you brown nose the right person.,Booking.com
403,403,uncertainty,3.0,the fast paced environment definitely keeps you on your toes. there isnt much room to feel bored in a company growing so quickly. youre encouraged to make your coworkers your friends and this type of environment promotes good support. 401k and good insurance coverage.,the pay is lower than other call centers in the area. it seems as though the company is growing faster than it knows how to properly hire for. upper management tends to be out of touch with low level employees and the rule changes often reflect this.,Booking.com

407,407,more like a high school than a job,3.0,it is a very relax work environment. its a lot of overtime offered.,very poor management structure. their has been alot of changes to upper management which are causing alot of employees to look for work elsewhere. youre not required to take a drug test and alot of team leads clearly come into work under the influence. team leads talk behind each others back to the agents. this compares to an high school with all the clicks and rumors.,Booking.com
408,408,account manager role at booking,5.0,sense of importance and contribution to such a huge corporation although booking.com is a large company i have already in my 4 months here met the ceo of priceline product owners and other upperlevel players in the company who visited the office and were eager to hear my and my colleagues feedback. i meet and work with people from all over the world. i travel to the central coast of california often. office culture has been extremely welcoming fun and down to earth. there are a number of opportunities within booking.com to grow my career both vertically and horizontally i work in the hotels department but work closely with all other departments. i feel valued as an employee. there is a lot of autonomy and responsibility i feel i am growing professionally in a supportive atmosphere. it is essentially the hospitality industry so all the people i work alongside are awesome and fun. access to a lot of industry information gaining knowledge. the best part of working here is feeling proud to represent the company i work for.,rampup period is lengthy must stay very organized,Booking.com
409,409,great company  poor management,3.0,great learning opportunity there is a lot of room to learn and do. you do get trips to amsterdam every now and then. the office space is fun and for the most part your colleagues can be fun as well,management is poor. they have no experience managing people before and do not lead by example at all. some of them express behaviours that are shameful to be expressed in public.,Booking.com

437,437,dont drink that blue koolaid,1.0,you will make some lifelong friends. yearly trip to amsterdam. they used to have a strong internal training program but that has since been scraped.,management was so incredibly inept. the whole purpose and potential for a rewarding and stimulating career or any sort of personal development gets lost in office politics or mean girl behavior reminiscent of a really lame high school. the only people who can tolerate it are those who are skilled and shameless kissups and those who are unable or unwilling to speak up. it is also an incredibly inefficient workplace. they absolutely refuse to consider using salesforce but instead rely on a ridiculous internally developed crm like tool that doesnt work and countless google docs...no joke. however they want everything to be tracked. all the tools that were rolled out during my tenure lack the functionality to be of any use and we were expected to develop our own work arounds. you will work hard and hustle for a salary that does not allow you to live comfortably. your quarterly bonus if you overachieve and totally kill it will be less the 2k. but it is pretty unlikely that you will hit the impossibly high targets. turnover is very high due to the extremely low morale and demoralizing office environment. management had been making a concerted effort to push seasoned employees out despite strong performances and proven results. those who hadnt found better opportunities were unceremoniously laid off with out notice. since they had no grounds for termination they were required to pay out severance to all. if you have integrity or selfrespect i would highly suggest looking elsewhere. it may seem like a cool place to work at at first...casual workplace yearly trip to amsterdam etc. but dont be fooled. the smart and talented people leave. it is not worth the laughable salary which is significantly below market standards. there are hundreds of other am positions out there that allow for a positive work environment development selfrespect respect from your superiors and peers etc. plus they will pay you what you are worth and then you can treat yourself to a cool trip to amsterdam and not be subjected to all the booking blue bs. lastly and almost possibly most disturbing is the impenetrable glass ceiling that is in effect. booking.com has a very significant female majority. rarely is a female promoted into any leadership role. although i cannot imagine any of the women currently in midmanagement would be any better than those running the show.,Booking.com
438,438,fun startingout job,3.0,international travel was a huge benefit,upper management communication  they didnt communicate well to employees.,Booking.com
439,439,working at booking.com for dummies,5.0,i have been working for booking.com for just under a year. i have seen a lot that goes on here and i am going to tell you everything you need to know about it. booking.com has been at this location for about 15 months now. they are growing at an incredible speed and there is a lot of change going on. this can be good and bad. growing fast means a lot of hiring for every position in the office. you hear other companies say that they hirepromote from within and then nothing ever happens.. that is the complete opposite about this company. i have seen people start as customer service representatives and then become seniors quality associates recruiting assistants trainers team leads and even operations managers. true story. if you are motivated a team player energetic adaptable and put a smile on your face while providing customer service the best you can.. you will be promoted and thats not just for the seattlebellevue office. you can transfer to any location you can imagine again.. true story. and remember booking.com is an international company with offices all around the world. booking.change change can be hard for some people. some people need those concrete instructions and its hard for them to adapt when something fluctuates. this is a newer company in the greater seattle area and they are still trying to work out a couple kinks. they are hiring a lot of new people who might be trying to figure out the best way to manage their employees. the training has changed a lot since they opened. the interview process has changed a couple times. they have switched from one customer service program to another just a couple months ago. they are still trying to figure out the correctfair way to distribute different shifts throughout the day. having said all that. all this change is a good thing too. you can sincerely tell that this company cares about their employees. booking provides these huge starbucks machines that make you anything you want. anything. free fresh fruit delivered every morning. an xbox one with comfy lounge chairs everywhere can you say fifa tournament a ping pong table. even a shuffleboard table. this office is gorgeous. bright open and also has one of the best views of seattle ive seen.. from bellevue. tuition reimbursement travel reimbursement orca cards free parking. new monitors headsets ergonomic office desks and chairs. company sporting events company sport teams hiking clubs and board game clubs. what else can you ask for i know what you are thinking.. great we are just sitting down all day and cant get any exercise would a onsite gym be what you are looking for because they have that too. but wait what about benefits they give us great benefits and 401k. booking.com does this because they know people with a lot to offer want to work for companies that have empathy enthusiasm and have a progressive culture. i should probably also mention that employees are often hired in as a contingent staff members. i know this can be hard for some people because you dont know what can happen.. you might need to quit your other job to take this one.. what happens if you dont get transitioned into a booking.com employee is that possible of course it is.. but i know that booking.com truly has full intentions to hire everyone that goes through training. its just up to you when you start. be on time willing to learn stay positive and provide that outstanding customer service and you could transition from a contingent staff member to a booking.com employee in less than 3 months. this means that in those first couple months you are building up towards being a booking.com employee and receiving the full benefits package. scheduling. dun. dun. dun scheduling can be difficult. but so can we. you might have a harder schedule for a couple months but you will get an opportunity to bid to change it. the scheduling team seems to be very accommodating for bus schedules after training and approve most vacations i have seen. the office is open from 600am1130pm mondaysunday so you wont ever work overnight.. but when it comes down to it this is a job. a good job. if you want to get involved in a good company and grow just as fast as the office does.. i think you can stick it out. typically when a person first joins us they are asked to work the 2nd shift and to work weekends at times. training is a blast. you are bombarded with culture. around 25 new hires are in a classroom setting and you will be trained on most if not all of the questions and calls you will receive. the trainers are amazing. very outgoing very positive and extremely helpful. this company invests in their employees and it all starts with how you are trained. you will be nervous the first day but who isnt. by graduation you will be hanging out outside of work with the same people you didnt know 5 weeks earlier. management is very supportive devoted and dependent on your success.. they all have different styles of management but from my perspective they all work. all of the team leads are friendly and actually care about their teams. the operation managers hr and higher ups are always thinking of new ways to show their appreciation to the office and the success the office has had. they all walk the floors and you wouldnt be able to tell who is who unless you asked. they even could just sit next to you for the day and work there pretty cool. hope this answers any of the questions or concerns you might have.,the pay is a little low. that can be hard. but

442,442,poor management,2.0,travel young vibrant colleagues free food lunches snacks booze,management that has never managed before and should never manage. if you accept a position here be prepared to lose some selfworth as management expects colleagues to be fully skilled upon hiring. one office just opened and has seen every employee turn over except for one manager who might be part of the problem. poor worklife balance. my favorite quote from a colleague ive always been an expert at time management until i got to booking. you are told to change direction daily and to avoid your emails in order to complete other tasks. at the end of the day you have 70 emails from hotels and no time to enjoy your own life. one pillar is keep the customer at the center of everything you do but the offices do not walk the walk. a hotel will email asking for assistance but you can get to it because youre doing a hundred other things. you are told not to answer the phone but to continue calling and harassing hotels to meet your goals. others can wait until these goals are met. the bottom line is the center of everything the hotels department does. no training at some point the training department was cancelled all together so new colleagues are trained in office and pretty much thrown to the wolves. you will get in trouble for something you didnt even know was your job and that you had never even seen before. i hear that there used to be full training before you even got to the local offices. now its the blind leading the blind. while there they cancelled a position. i mean told forty something people that their job would not exist in 3 months and to figure out what they want to do next. how does this make employees feel valued when their job is gone in a blink of an eye worst part is this was a management position and the folks in the jobs were some of the most admired and trusted associates. all gone now. they keep the salaries low and tempt you with bonus that end up being unobtainable. they even decide to change the bonus with 10 days left to the quarter,Booking.com

445,445,ok....but not what it is cracked up to be,3.0,great colleagues beautiful office spaces annual trip to amsterdam health benefits,the company has become solely focused on sales. the training department has diminished. the only new trainings that are available are web based. traveling for training used to be a huge selling point. they truly couldnt care about the partner unless the are given what they want. they are all about quantity of quality. no room for advancement once you hit account manager. people do a lot of brown nosing to get promoted. they preach team work but if goals arent hit it will fall on the individual. you must interview for a lateral move in a different office for the exact same position. micromanagement,Booking.com

447,447,cse,1.0,good people to work with,when i started with booking i was told what a fun environment it was lots of training everybody is willing to help lay back environment.. its not true booking wants the impossible for the employees you are trained  very bad training on such a rush dont even have time to ask any questions but they say  have questions ask ask ask   whe cant  but there will be no answer there is never time to answer. then you go to the floor like in a cage full of lions where you have to take calls that you were never trained on it.. and if you try to transfer the call the cse will give a excuse and dont take your call.. so you call senior line that takes forever to answer the phone... very disappointed with booking,Booking.com
448,448,dont be fool by nice office free coffes and fruits there is a different side of booking.com,1.0,i would say the same that all reviews mention in pros nice office free coffee  fruits and thats about it the office and especially restrooms are crowded due to 450 employees has been working there.,booking has insufficient employees performance evaluation by productivity and guest satisfaction. expectations the following productivity  no less than 5.5 guests per hour and satisfaction at least  95.looks easy but dont be happy. the company is overwhelmed with guests complains due to the very strange way of them running their business. when guests enter their credit card on booking website they believe they pay booking so when they call booking with questions about charges or room related questions booking cannot answer it as booking doesnt charge guests. booking reps have to investigate and to seek the answer from hotels what takes some time.that way of doing their business creates a lot of frustrations with the guests and a lot of guests complains. how will you achieve your productivity and guest satisfaction if you are on the phone with the same guest for 2 hours because hotel cannot find guest booking or cannot accommodate guest with the right room or has no any room available to accommodate the guest you must find the solution like some alternate hotel if you are able to and then to advise guest to book it online quickly because you cannot book it for the guest i have never seen such craziness in my life. i have been working in travel company and in hotel reservation before and it was easy simple and enjoyable  answer guests questions and proceed with booking. that is not the case in booking. second huge con is super inexperienced young management. management knows the booing operating system they know the company business policy but they have no idea how to manage all that diverse people. due to the rapid company growth they promote to management positions within company to save the money on experience outsiders. your manager can be 2327 years person from oversees who has never been a manager and has no idea what is appropriate and what is not by us workplace culture standards. for example you can be ordered on your lunch time to go walking on the parking lot to manage your stress and frustrations from bad customers. but then when are you going to eat your lunch and you have only 10 minutes a day for your personal needs  like restrooms. and if you maximize it you better drink less water and go less otherwise youll get negative points toward your attendance. if you get sick and even bring medical doctor paper theyll still count a missed day as a negative point on your attendance. and if you are not in your 20th like most of booking employees and you are older and experienced and respect yourself you will not feel good about being under such management and under such army rules. the pay in booking is very low thats why most of the employees young or immigrants for who it is ok to start with 13h. dont be fool with all those free coffees  fruits and free lunches. find the company that will pay you enough to buy your lunches coffees and fruits.,Booking.com

486,486,account managers eggs about to crack,2.0,as an account manager the job itself isnt exactly mind bending or overly complicated technically speaking. working with some great hotel partners networking and gaining real industry knowledge is great. friendly coworkers sense of team work amongst those of same job title fun office activities catered lunch good benefits but pay is below industry standard and annual trip to amsterdam.,in the u.s. there is a new structure in place where account managers have to be out of the office every other week with every friday as an in office day to have all day long meetings. so what does that mean im already in this constant state of being stressed out from having to schedule 20 meetings with clients in a week mth have team meeting and office meetings on friday having to follow up from those client meetings while then having to start all over and schedule meetings again for the next week out. then throw in the added work of doing pricing all day long when you are in the office and being told that you cant do anything else even though you still have responsibility to partners to fix their escalated customer service issues and respond to any other inquiries they may send you. all in the meanwhile targets and focus seem to change from week to week or even from day to day senior account managers offer little to no support and are being told from upper management to micromanage the heck out of us. everything is tracked now and even though they keep saying oh we are not tracking you they are and they just wont admit it. there are invisible quotas. i still havent figured out why. i think upper management now has this general distrust of the am team when i know full well all of us at least in my office are sharp and very skilled at what we do and we all have good relationships with our partners. back to the travel schedule  trying to prepare schedule and meet 5 partner visits a day 4 days a week is just draining. by wednesday i am so tired from talking to people thinking about what i am going to say to them showing them the reports and then actioning and doing follow up that i just want to fall into a blackhole and disappear. its exhausting and i dont know how long i will last like this. i really really hate this. last the bonus and how things are calculated  i think they must be consulting with the governments education department because its like common core math for business. heres an idea give us individual targets based in reality and then we wont be left to guess where we stand in reaching whatever  of our salary to be paid as bonus. in summary the am team is underpaid overstressed and demoralized to the fact that we are being micromanaged to the point of mistrust when there is no reason to mistrust. it is very sad because when i first started a couple years ago it was not like this. i like my office my coworkers the benefits and my hotel partners. this egg might crack soon.,Booking.com

509,509,at most a stepping stone,1.0,you dont need much knowledge or experience to step into most roles at the company in order to succeed. they provide plenty of training and overview considered by some to be overkill before you even lift a finger in whatever role youll fill. the jobs themselves are easy and the tools provided basically handfeed you all the relevant information. the benefits package is decent there are companysponsored happy hours generally once per month and a company holiday party held in amsterdam each winter. also this is the epitome of a 95 job where there is rarely anything so important that it cant wait until your next workday.,while easy the work load in the last year for most roles at the company has grown so exponentially that it has become bitterly overwhelming. the constant merging and purging that that company has done has left the remaining employees accumulating new responsibilities with no additional compensation and with low morale fearing future secret decisions will lead to further mass displacement or firings. speaking of which pay is beyond low. the company pays well below the average compared to other top competitors within a similar industry and the standards for earning the quarterly bonuses keep changing. many employees have even halfjokingly accused the company of testing for ways to make it impossible to earn. most managers lack knowledge leadership skills or both. opportunities are extremely rare at this point within any of the established offices in the us and most that do become available are often filled with candidates from the european offices. in my time with the company 11 upper level positions senior or better became available and only 4 were filled with candidates from our local office and only 2 candidates were from lowlevel positions in the office and i was part of one of the biggest offices in the us.,Booking.com

550,550,it is not for everyone....bad management,2.0,it allows you to work with cultures from all over the world. the company always organizes events for employees. if you are a doer then you can grow in the company. if you work in the global team then you can easily travel to many offices in the world.,salaries are not competitive below the market average. the environment is toxic the management does not have credentials and no values. there is no transparency there are barely rules for performance reviews so if your manager is a bad person then you are in great disadvantage as he will not be objective and your evaluation will be nonfact based and subjective. there are no opportunities to growth or advance in your career. hr will always choose to listen to the managers.,Booking.com

553,553,good for a short contract,2.0, the company gives a lot of benefits like a genius account where you can do bookings with a discount and also they will give you back 25 of your friends bookings up to 1000 eur per year.  the environment is very international and people are mostly friendly. it is very welcoming for any type of minority including lgbt or in any racial context  depending on your performance they will give a quarterly bonus that usually is around 6 of your earnings in the specific quarter, management can be very drastic with some decision making and leave people in the unknown.  at least for cdd contracts the job is very insecure. from the hired party in my group probably around 50 were fired or not renewed before or at the end of their contract.  even though the job seems very flexible at first they have a lot of rules regarding your holidays daysoff and working times.  you will also have to take a look at your payslips and be proactive with the payment of your benefits as hr can get it wrong and will not notice you.,Booking.com

560,560,more disappointing than game of thrones,2.0, you will meet many people from different countries you can do that just leaving your house in the morning too by the way.  you will be part of a magical wonderland where your team is all that matters until you start looking at progression and those people will become the reason you will not get that promotion.  you will get a discrete salary for the city you are living in just for being on the phone all day  free meals and a warm place to work in sometimes way too warm though...  the many charity support events,this company used to be a 45 stars.  management  management yes again  lack of communication between the different departments please people is 2020  projects thieves around every corner  dont work for the bonus it is just not worth your time  your visibility and interest in being social count more than your skills  your feedback is completely useless. if you are smart enough you will use it to show that you have your workplace at interest otherwise get ready for some good disappointment  your colleagues are not going to back you up because cmon everyone has to pay their rent at the end of the day  3 sickness instances in a rolling year you still hire human beings not robots. sarcasm badmouthing jealousy. these are only three of the bugs that spread around the offices. and it is such a shame by the way. yeah feel free to go to work with your high heels colorful skirts pink hair tattoos and piercings but the truth is that the only way to feel free is to not care about the others just like any other place in the world. nothing but another corporate growing too fast. too big to be small and too small to be big. quantity over qual...people. colleagues more keen on challenging you just because youre not giving them what they want rather than having any sort of work ethic. the main issue of the company right now is the total incapability to the feedback on board forward it to the right people well of course due to the huge lack of communication and actually do something with it you think someone is going to sit in a room and discuss the so much wanted and requested feedback but the truth is that they already have it all planned and you cant do anything about it. and youll get laughed in your face about it by those who are in charge of weighting your performance. i wonder whos weighting them... everything comes from global. nice way to avoid taking ownership of actions classy. agents will have about 45 main changes per year in their role with no chance to speak up again no space for feedback. seniors are...what do they do again im pretty sure at this point they dont even know where they stand. team leaders a bunch of high school kids. not all is bad out there but most them are. csms. well they are team leaders with more power so basically anything can happen. workplace. lets talk about it. you have people posting pictures with their partners creating groups absolutely not work related like some kind of fashion show and you just dont do anything about it and you just let them use the company hashtag b.anythingthatpopsinmymind in the wrong way. even who doesnt care about workplace is annoyed. no matter how many reports complaints emails chats and comments will be forwarded against someone theyll generally end up leaving simply because a better opportunity came up for them. instead of admitting that theyre just incompetent patronising and poisoning for whoever work around them. well at least they leave. sometimes. if you have an idea a good one make sure you register your patent before bringing it to someone because they will know how to take it put their name on it and get all the credit while theyre listening to you talking. and then leave cause they will become your team leaders. if the ceo intend to even remotely consider this review as constructive please rethink the company youve now taken full ownership for and listen to what you hear cause your employees are complaining crying speaking up and your management is just choosing not to listen to them. quoting your words about bam 2019 it didnt work. you have the chance to make it work now. booking.com is nothing but a good student that has potential and just doesnt care enough about it. with our previous ceo weve lost the human touch that was what made booking.com different. oh and by the way telling your employees worldwide that ltgt its really not. whether this is true or not you gotta have the ability to give a bad news keeping your staff motivated and starting 2020 with the message that all our hard work was ok was like a thousand knives in our hearts. the biggest mistake its been starting a company open minded and ready to welcome everything and everyone yeah maybe you shouldve set some standards in the past about this in this magical loose world where there was barely a rule and now is all about restrictions scripts and customer satisfaction. how about your employee experience first for a change,Booking.com

601,601,it has a lot of potential but still has a long way to go,2.0, great colleagues from all over the world.  monthly parties and quarterly team outings  nice office located in a nice area of london  decent salary with quarterly bonuses depending on your performance however your bonus will depend on your tl so its not about the numbers but hisher very personal opinion of you  many benefits from health insurance to glasses allowance canteen with ok food  free coffee fresh fruits and drinks.  opportunity to learn a lot about the travel industry on your own but the knowledge is there for the taking  globally speaking the company is great  some good tls the exception to the rule,booking.com is a company that has everything it needs to be a great place to work but sadly is anything but at least at the london office and particularly if youre a customer service agent the problem stems from management. when i joined the company i was lucky to have an extremely professional tl there are very few left in london. this person was organised hardworking very supportive of her agents and kept everything professional. the rest of the tls on that area behaved in a similar way so i spent 6 months in relative peace learning everything i could about the job. my tl motivated me and my colleagues to go the extra mile and supported our development within the company. however my tl was reassigned to another department i changed my shiftpattern and thats when things started to go downhill. i realized many tls were barely qualified to lead. no empathy no real knowledge of the procedures not helpful when dealing with hr matters and many passiveaggressive ways of communicating news or changes. they are basically glorified nannies who think less of their agents just for being agents. also some had an unspoken agreement to cover each others backs. while agents worked nonstop answering calls afraid of not hitting the targets constantly being yelled at by angry customers many tls would do the bare minimum. a lot of them befriended or dated their agents outside of the office something strictly prohibited since the tls have way too much power over agents performance evaluations bonuses and career progression. there have been several sexual scandals many linked to favouritism or simply things that should be reported to the authorities. some shift patterns will affect your physical and mental health weekends or 10hour shifts for example. so if you want a stable job for a couple of months just first job in london for example id recommend booking. do you want a career and progression apply somewhere else. they want you to stay on the phonechat as long as they can.,Booking.com

624,624,a melting pot of expats a handy start in a new country. also a place of incompetence  burnouts.,1.0,i gained some truly nice friendships over the past years. i got a permanent contract which enabled me to by real estate in the netherlands.,i had been performing monotone meaningless and very often totally nonsense tasks in the so called commercial outbound department in amsterdam. believe me when i say performing these tasks were the best part of the job. all the rest comes in a list below. feeling useless if this department would close from one day to the other then nothing absolutely nothing would go wrong and the business would not miss it. the overlapping departments would then take over what makes sense to perform. 0 trust culture my working day was hardly about work. it was about how to show and prove that i am working well. doing a great job was never that obvious to the team leaders who had trouble managing their good workers unless the magic numbers were in the workers favor. these numbers have been measured in a quarterly modified performance management dashboard and with a constantly changing logic. they had an influence on our personal bonus and on the mood of the performance evaluation meetings. one head does not know what the other head does random targets are being set by a separate department like big brother knows everything  style. the big brother team can be imagined as 3 or more brothers one is in charge of performance one of tooling and one of commercial tasks etc. the brothers do not talk to each other and therefore no one gets a full picture of what is happening and why. the overall influence of the big brother team on our department has been so successful that the performance logic and dashboard have been changed in every quarter in the past 2.5 years and this constant forced troubled change had driven my colleagues nuts. at the end the department management tend follow all the silly orders blindly without trying questioning feedback and real initiatives. no one in charge our managers are never in charge of any real decision because the big brother team decides it all they say. the team with multiple heads arguments that our tls should manage our expectations better. as a result pointing fingers doing nothing well and not being responsible for all that is the game. development we had a meeting with hr as part of a developmentweek more than a year ago. hr told us that the chances that we get internally hired into an advanced role is close to 0. but we can switch sideways into a similar slightly less useless job. also advancing in our amazing department into a goodfornothing tl role and become part of the neurotic tl team had been definitely out of question. my colleagues who made the sideways move are unhappy or overworked or on a burnout. the empty office colleagues on longterm sick leave plenty of burnouts no contracts extended colleagues quit cause fed up quit cause got depressed by work quit for better opportunities any opportunity quit cause the boss does not allow part time in a department in which the majority of the coworkers work part time and the job is definitely not that responsible and brainy one that could not be filled in part time. forced everything the worst were the forced interactions. there was a childish department employee behavior framework to comply with a bunch of useless meetings to attend useless knowledge exchange huddles in which we were forced to act active and motivated stand up meetings which every executive would love to avoid because there is a difference between knowing in our heads that our department is a failure and experiencing this failure in a face to face forced stand up meeting with everybody incl. management. watching our tired demotivated hardly competent team leads standing in front of us and playing the role of the small boss and acting like they would be a real management team for 10 minutes but after the meeting they delegate basically all their responsibilities or just simply fail to perform them. watching the big boss who commutes in the office like a silent ghost and has 0 people skills standing in front of us in silence cause he delegated all the talking to the tls already. he speaks only when he has to underline the importance of our targets and the department bonus his bonus his reputation. degrees true knowledge and valuable experience forget it and watch how external people with less of everything apply and get jobs which you would want go for but are not able because you are from internal where the castelike system rules apply.,Booking.com
625,625,low to midlevel management is a disaster,2.0,good food some new colleagues,all managers from lower to midlevel management is so inexperienced and out of touch it is affecting good employees because the only thing they think about is themselves and how to suck up to their boss who is even worse both levels of managers cant think for themselves looking for regular validation from equally bad supervisors. they are consistently ignoring their teams complaints and that is one of the main reasons staff turnover is so high that some teams are hiring staff all year long. if you see they are consistently hiring there is something wrong with the team culture and i highly recommend to stay away from those areas.,Booking.com

758,758,not your regular call centre,5.0,the company takes care of you in all possible ways. the salary is exactly what was promised or more. always paid on time. you get health insurance even in countries where you are already insured by the govt so you can go to private health institutions. you get a free meal per day. if you work on the weekend shift your schedule is very fixed and you can plan things too. the company encourages admitting mistakes and learning from them rather than punishing you for them. the company embraces its values and accepts you for who you are. you are required to do what you must work with guestspartners. nobody will tell you that you need to wear a suit or carry boxes with milk or wipe the floors or stay after hours because well we need you.,some of the trainers were not really professional and skilled thus a lot of misinformation happened. due to various language lines having different difficulties and workflow it is sometimes hard to communicate with colleagues especially if you are green,Booking.com

762,762,many opportunities,4.0,already work over 7 years at b.com and i have had many opportunities to learn and grow and to meet interesting and smart people from all around the world, the company has grown tremendously since i started. this has brought reorganizations reprioritizations so many changes. the company has to professionalize itself but that also means there will be less freedom and more structure and rules.  i feel that developers and data scientists are sometimes held less accountable than businesscommercial people. we have to hand held them to make sure they stay at booking.,Booking.com
763,763,serious problem with the office management,1.0,great coworkers international work environment a proper global set up still the local management and draconian policies that are on basically restricting basic human rights spoiled something quite good i worked for cbg office for more than 5 years and at the start there was strong management quite strict but strong and their decisions were based on the benefits of business promotions career development team structures not on the basis who is your favourite in the office. basically there was a vivid intention to stick to the companys code of behaviour and meritocracy. thanks to changes of the site managers a person got the position based on cv that was let say inaccurate from bad to worse once a good place to work in 5 years changed to a place that was unrecognizable from the best to the worst hr practice,customer service jobs are always difficult still as mentioned before if the company has the right culture providing enough support training downtime and not pushing unrealistic targets and kpis year on it could be a good place to work. just to sum up the main negatives team leaders are 90 local people that forged a strong connection protecting each other no matter what they have done most of them are not highly educated no degrees on the other side most of the employees are foreigners with a strong international background and high education they speak several languages combined with good it skills and master degree in various subjects. still the majority of employees doesnt know uk employment law. the management is fully aware of this fact and constantly takes advantage of young and vulnerable employees. the result is that incidents of bullying and sexual harassment were never handled properly. just one example during the post companys social event a team leader sexually harassed an employee a member of another team. the best practice in case of young and vulnerable would be to put the team leader in another office until the investigation is done to prevent his influence on peoples statements and actually the company should have advised the victim to go to the police and report the incident. none of that was put in place the victim was silenced and the team leader still works in the same office. hr is one of the weakest links in this business operation and they just serve one purpose to aid team leaders whilst firing employees. in spite of that all serious official complains submitted via regular companys channels were never upheld. even in the case when the members investigating the case and finding that the complaint was based on solid evidence no appropriate action was taken to make things better. the sick leave policy is appalling there were instances that employees with cancer were bullied into leaving the company there is always disciplinary procedure hence if you have young children or occasionally suffer from flu or cold this is not the place for you.,Booking.com

771,771,the job offer youre going to regret accepting,1.0,i would say the colleagues but thats not always true and even when it is its definitely not thanks to the company,you would think that being hired in such a prestigious company if you do an excellent job completely surpass every single target set for your role and assist your peers with their targets you will have a chance to grow within the company and to be promoted in positions youre highly qualified for. think again good looking good at networking but yet mediocre at their work colleagues will be promoted over you every single time. before youll know you will be stuck in a role and with a company that is full of empty words about inclusive work environment and growth opportunities. when youre going to be on the brink of burnout the pressure will start. in some companies youre just a number and i can live with that if great numbers are given the chance to progress their career. in this company you wont be even that.,Booking.com

794,794,unsettled in manchester,2.0, access to some really great hotels  good car hire  fantastic regional management,booking.com is clearly a fantastic company for the end user. there is a huge amount of love from a ux perspective. the company has grown insanely quickly in the last 10 years or so and therein lies a problem. there are some wonderful area amp regional managers at booking.com however the senior account managers are controlling amp devious. they are in their position on the back of time served with the company rather than any form of people management. my senior account manager was clearly out of her depth with regards to people management and was extremely temperamental. the role at booking.com is also not communicated effectively at the interview for an account manager. make no mistake about it  this is not an account management position but customer service. you are required to answer hotel enquiries all day every day. it feels like an old fashioned boiler room  with much emphasis placed on how many calls you make per day. it may work for some people but for me i was not aware of the customer service aspect of this role before i started. the atmosphere within the manchester office is also toxic. there are a number of issues with the team who are regularly kept on their toes with onetoone meetings about the most petty of incidents. managers will ask their staff why it was that they werent as loud as normal in meetings you will be questioned as to why you were 5 minutes late back from lunch amp you will also be instructed to make that time back up at the end of the day. at the heart of the manchester office there is a power struggle. the two senior account managers when i left were desperately clinging to power in any way they saw fit amp would lash out at anyone unfortunate to be within shouting distance. it is a cloak amp dagger office  if you play the game youll be well suited  if you dont then youll be out.,Booking.com

836,836,amazing company and an open culture that encourages feedback,5.0, open feedback culture  i work with the smartest people ive ever had the pleasure of calling colleagues  diverse multicultural environment  cool office spaces and healthy basically free lunches  flat company structure with little micromanagement and the ability to prioritise your own workload  regular paidfor staff events from drinking to rock climbing to archery  an ability to make new stuff and see the results really quickly  a support network to help you move to nl including movers estate agents and free accommodation for up to 1 month when you arrive while you look for your first home to rent  amsterdam is a wonderful city and an amazing place to call home  i love my work  worklife balance is highly prioritised. if youre constantly working late people wonder why you cant manage your workload better rather than patting you on the back for having your butt in the chair for longer than you need to, open feedback culture  also a negative because booking really does treat its staff incredibly well. and when you treat people incredibly well they sometimes dont realise how lucky they are and become spoiled  internal facebook  just like normal facebook the internal social media tool within booking often serves as an echo chamber and polarises users into extremist camps for and against an issue with little room for nuance. it can even lead to witch hunts. this is what allows many of the negative opinions of what is a fantastic but of course not perfect company to find an audience and grow into something that doesnt represent reality anymore. also facebook is a terrible company  the amsterdam hq is bursting at the seams with people. the rate of hiring has lead to overcrowding,Booking.com
837,837,on a downward spiral as the years pass. terrible place to work.,1.0, paid lunches.  enough employees to find some nice people to get you through the day.  salary was competitive for the field.  booking.comas a company is not a bad employer its specifically the cambridge office that is a bad place to work.,the management over the past 5 years have taken this office in a really unfortunate and negative direction. looking back it was a great place to be nearly everyone was happy to come to work. however due to a steady influx of negativeidiotic changes its been turned into a joyless machine that churns through staff on a regular basis. my main points of contention are as follows  high turnover of staff due to unrealistic expectations. and the ones that are left are thoroughly miserable and looking for other work. horrible atmosphere in the office due to this.  the management have no sense of what its like to be an agent take no care in the wellbeing of their employees and just push them to edge of their sanity. its as if they have come to an agreement that they dont want anyone in the company to last more than a couple of yearsmost likely so they can keep hiring cheaper new people rather than pay loyal hard working employees a higher salary.  if you do manage to struggle through and survive the unrealistic targets set by the management youre not rewarded for your loyalty. being a long standing employee garners no benefits the management dont want you there for long.  equal opportunities doesnt exist. the only opportunities to be promoted are given to those who can consistently fake a positive attitude. to those who consistently tell the management what they want to hear. the hard working people who add constructive criticism are punished for speaking out.  very very harsh handling of sick leave. all employees are under extreme pressure to never take a day off sick. if you are sick on your return you have to justify that sickness and are asked questions like how could you avoid being sick in the future. they literally set targets such as dont be sick for the next 6 months. if you continue to be sick its highly likely that youll be dismissed.  clear favouritism towards team leaders hr and management. if you are a team leader you can essentially abuse your position and get away with doing very little for a lot more money. quite the opposite to that of agents and senior support staff. in my time there i saw many turning up late with no repercussions. saw team leaders quite literally bullying agents targeting agents that they didnt like to push them out of the company. hr are supposed to be impartial and there if you feel something is not right or not fair. the problem is that hr protects management and team leaders. they are far too friendly with them to remain impartial and professional. due to being protected they can do no wrong as far as the company is concerned.  planningscheduling is all that matters anymore. adhering to the ridiculous schedules is the only thing that management care about. there is no flexibility with your day. youre told when you can take a break and will be punished for being minutes out of adherence. even if youre forced to be late for a break due to a difficult customer shouting at you on the phone for ages. i worked there a long time. i have near unlimited further points to justify why i think the booking.com cambridge office is a terrible place to work. but frankly ive already given too much of my life to this company. even airing my complaints is tiring. i hope that ive at least made it clear to those reading this that they should not apply for a job here. and to those who are currently working there hang in there keep searching youll find something much better soon enough. avoid this office like the plague.,Booking.com

843,843,attention to  headquarters in amsterdam,2.0,free lunch monthly office party benefits.,i can tell you for free why the london office is one of the worst performing offices. there is a toxic environment which has come from decisions taken differently based on subjective views and there is no equality between employees. it is absolutely right to ensure that attendance policies are adhered to however those policies only seem to be applicable to customer service agents only and not senior members of staff such as team leaders or management. examples of this are people losing their jobs or put under pressure for formal meetings and warnings however team leaders are blatantly arriving late themselves in front of agents on more occasions than those people getting fired. sometimes they try and cover it up saying they were in a meeting room when you can clearly see them running into the building. agents are not able to see when their managers are late on the same system where every single customer service agent latenesses are shown to all employees. also people are actually losing their jobs or having formal meetings led by those same team leaders. another important thing is that employees wellbeing has been completely forgotten because its all about numbers and there is no human touch or empathy in any way. there is no appreciation or values for the agents which are the heart of this company and this obviously reflects in the quality of the performances as well. investigations are performed on certain agents but not on others that have a really good connections with managers or team leaders and this has absolutely brought the situation to another level. is no coincidence that employees have successfully sued the company multiple times. also imagine your job being on the line because customers voice their feedback over issues such as booking.com policies or hotel complaints via a questionnaire that is sent to determine their satisfaction on the interaction had with the agent. career progression is extremely slow and it could take several months or years. who is cheaky is rewarded against who works honestly and hard. finally employees want to raise their concerns as this is what this office has been going through lately but are scared of being targeted or victimised. this has to stop because something serious could happen and it could bring many people to mental breakdowns or even worse.,Booking.com

851,851,theatrical fast paced company where things dont get done.,2.0,restaurant cafe events and worklife balance.,managers are not prepared and are really biased on promotionhiring process even though theres a lot of different rounds for it with different people you see that what matters for the company is being a good marketeer getting things done is not important the company doesnt even have targets in many departments and when they have it generates friction because is not aligned with the overall strategy. the company is afraid of what they dont understand they probably have twice the workforce they need for what they deliver you see a lot of people arriving in the office at 11 and going home at 15 being in a 40 hours full contract the worse part is that this is the kind of people that is promoted. vacancies are created without needs analysis so dont be surprised that they will hire you and wont have anything for you to do during a couple of months. the company works in silos with their own kings. b.com is not transparent when people leave or is fired and also when they decide to reduce costs like cutting bam and other benefits everything related to this is always communicated like a santa claus story. another interesting fact is that booking is structured in order to create place for people departments appear and disappear if people leave the structure is not based in what is needed. also they use not global standards for names of departments and functions so do not be surprised of going to an interview and do not understand what they are talking about also a perfect match of your cv with a vacancy can in fact mean that is not a match because at b.com even this is a mess. culture and values are just in the paper. salary wise you will be underpaid when compared to any other company in amsterdam.,Booking.com

855,855,mediocre engineering culture with severe lack of ownership,2.0,this is a tech review so ill focus on that. bookings scale is big. so if youre into large amounts of data interesting ab testing scalable architectures then booking has a lot of potential. be aware though that almost all of this is made a lot less interesting by the mediocre and halfbaked approach to almost everything in technology. if you like getting paid for 40 hours but only want to work 32 then booking is also great. show up at 1030 leave at 1730 fine. happens all the time. if you love perl then this is also a great company because like in perl theres more than one way to do it. so prepare to see every arcane perl operator you ever knew have three chat clients open because theres more than one way to reach someone prepare to work on lots of technologies that dont work together well and prepare to see many different management styles  ways to organise teams.,the engineering quality and technology is mediocre. a lot of teams are very business focussed which is great in principle in their particular domain but without anyone maintaining any kind of overview. this means that the default strategy is to just cram a feature in the existing code in the fastest way possible. that is look for the piece of code that needs to change and add an if mycoolfeatureenabled  else  construct. rinse and repeat until you have perl functions that span 5000 lines. no kidding. by that time everybody and their mother have touched that code so noone owns it anymore. meanwhile of course some people have gotten frustrated with the spaghetti perl code base that is impossible to navigate and is an archeological record of two decades of mostly uninspired hacks and copy pasting code the latter happens to the extreme. so new technologies have been added. which ones well its booking so noone owns this process. so theres java which is the only official second language for that matter. but of course the data scientists use python. and r. and theres go which is cool. and kotlin because its also cool. within the java world most popular web frameworks are being used. and so are all protocols you can think of. same on the frontend react angular its all there in various places. this freedom is nice on the one hand but it just doesnt work. it also leads to resentment between teams. why do they do their own when they could have used spring boot why do they do this in java when 3 lines of perl would have been fine. because noone takes ownership or dares to make decisions people do what suits them best. this is very pragmatic but it leads to loads of islands of different standards and tensions between these islands. standards not only in technology but also in quality of people. pointing this out invariably leads to an explanation along the following lines well yes but in order to understand this you need to know the context and then a war story comes to defend the mess. and thats fair enough but noone cleans up after themselves.,Booking.com

860,860,why you shouldnt go working there,2.0,the company offers a lot of distractions such as summer party freaky fridays a small refund on your reservation made through the website and other benefits. the company and management ask often opinion to the employees how things should have been done but without making an actual follow up on the suggestion. a lot of initiative outside work like bootcamps or volunteer program and so on. the salary is good compared to other companies.,the abovementioned points seem great but in reality the company is so demanding and have crazy standards that a certain point you wont have the energy and mindset to enjoy all of this. during my years in customer service there was pressure from all managers to work more better faster. they forced us to spend most of the day on the telephone without having the possibility to hang up the phone and keep on working on your computer. we had crazy security procedures which made us scare to pronounce the wrong word on the phone and being penalized. we were asked to do extra work and being updated with company procedures while we didnt have time for that. if you will work for them you wont even have the time to fo the bathroom. i left the company after having a huge burn out and the management didnt do anything except calling me one day yes and one no asking me to work without giving me time to recover. finally theres some attention on the issue. mental health is very problematic in booking and completely neglected. we were 10 in my team and 4 of us went burnout. specially if you have a past with mental problems any kind dont go to work there. the worst part of it at least in customer service all the people who were promoted used to go out a lot with management to drink and party. booking keeps on saying that networking is above all forgetting about actual the actual skills a person has to offer. many people i know who went burn out worked a lot but are introverted or have a family or social life so did not spend much time networking. i could go on longer trying to make my point but i think you understood that its not worth it.,Booking.com

888,888,stay away cronyism mismanagement lies.,1.0,amsterdam is a nice city. if you are happy with being a yes man then booking is definitely the place for you,do not join this horror show. it will ruin your life. everything is rotten management is so incompetent and simply got there by mistake that it horribly fears smart people with innovative idea and credentials. all the best talents are leaving or about to leave because theyre pushed out by idiotic managers who play games with peoples lifes. do you know people get hired from outside europe they call it diversity but its cost saving uprooted from their previous life then parked in a limbo where they have no scope no team no goals i know of at least 4 or 5 highly paid positions especially in product management that literally have no work to do and left on the bench the best part is that nobody told them in advance bad situations like this can happen to you because management doesnt exist here. the only way to survive is to obliterate your professional dignity and become a yes man drone do not buy any of the recruiters lies about the company culture they are well known for being the most incompetent of all workers at booking and are rewarded for their ability to just lure people with lies and hit the quotas. i cannot but stress how you should stay away from this company which completely lost its direction and strategy. nobody knows what is going on and top leadership is panicking. booking.com once the most efficient ppc machine to sell hotels has entered its senility and wont find any rejuvenation potion anywhere its tech is decrepit its management fears innovation its best people are leaving. over the next few years the company will have theee options like most old people slowly dying at home on its own bed surrounded by family dying in a hospice under a heavy amount of painrelieving drugs euthanasia. if you have ears listen.,Booking.com
889,889,a new nokia,1.0,some people are really wonderful,the problems booking.com faces now have been present and growing for several years. to anyone inside of the company these points are so familiar theyre cliche any suggestion of customer focus is a falsehood. metrics were invented which were supposed to be a proxy for customer satisfaction when even the most inexperienced of people could see through this even as it was being introduced  the real intent of these metrics was to offer an illusion of success to an hapless executive. and yet in quarterly meeting after quarterly meeting the leaders of the business sat silent in either disbelief or in complicity. as bumper organic growth delivered generous executive stock grants everyone won. it was never going to last. fast forward several years and this numerical falsehood has become dogma and not subscribing to it is to limit your career prospects severely. one need only look at the upper ranks of leadership to conclude that the best career move is to leave your ethics at the door refuse to engage with the concerns of the rankandfile dismiss consistent and cacophonous user feedback and do what mercenary and selfinterested product leadership demands no questions asked. oh and be a white dutch man. thatll also help. the lack of customer focus manifests itself in multiple and pernicious ways  from discriminatory pricing and pseudodiscounts to predatory sales techniques inflated urgency inflated review scores hidden fees and buried small print  not to mention the selling of settler properties in occupied palestine. classy. even having demonstrated that their aggressive sales techniques caused measurable physiological stress on customers the company still manages to find a way to dismiss this and trot out the user centricity lie. it is impressive to have somehow convinced thousands of people to believe they are doing good things for customers when they are objectively doing bad things for customers  and yet even as the ethical baseline sinks so does the previously rock solid growth rate. management was a dirty word for years and a legacy of being uncaring about people now means that even worse than having no managers we are surrounded by bad ones  young men mostly who lack both business nouse and the emotional intelligence to understand people what motivates them or how to provide an environment for people to do their best work. there is a smell of desperation coming from the technology organisation as they scramble for control having irreversibly lost it when their leader was removed from his post and was not replaced for far too long. the search took so long that the damage done will take many years to repair. not a soul amongst the leadership have even the faintest idea about how technology works. no this is not a tech company  it is a second hand car lot selling dingy hotel rooms in an antiquated programming language via a system of opaque policies and pricing strategies. the leadership team cult of personality is centred around a triumvirate of ethnoidentical pen pushers who crave control to go with their multimillion euro salaries and they in turn surround themselves with sycophantic yes men yes almost all men  amongst them newly minted vice presidents who have demonstrated an aptitude only for longterm repeated expensive failure adept at taking credit cash and cachet but not responsibility  but never fear we are only ever one reorganisation away from figuring it all out. project oranje indeed. this group will never lead this company through the critical phase it finds itself in after 3 years of false starts. unfortunately when it all comes crumbling down they will still be millionaires whilst the rest of us will be left with little more than a stain on our resums. emergency flares sent up to the skies above norwalk fail to catch the eye of the elders. if only they knew. the greatest tragedy is that whilst the company swells the ranks with well paid consultanttypes and lowpaid cro fodder there is a core of utterly disengaged veteran employees who are tied to the company by virtue of a cruel compensation structure which asks for longevity over loyalty quietude over conscience. and so these formerly brilliant people who have been tossed aside for daring to disagree are left to wilt whilst waiting for their next vesting hoping beyond hope that in the meantime the market doesnt start to ask questions about the growth of new business units or the scaling of rentalcars.com or booking.com for business or any of the myriad stillborn product initiatives to have withered and died in a company which has the chutzpah to still call itself innovative  a label which coincidentally benefits it to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros in tax waivers from the dutch government on profit almost exclusively generated overseas and funnelled back to to the netherlands via a network of shell companies designed for this specific purpose. experience the world pay in gilders. one day in the not too distant future an mba class will replace the classic example of nokia with that of booking.com  an incumbent beaten

947,947,not a place for independent thought...,2.0,good office environment mostly friendly people opportunity to migrate to eu if youre from overseas.,booking has a business model that works for now and they follow it to a t. you either fall in line like a lemming building alliances with and kissing up to the people above you or you leave. to bookings credit they do frequently copy and introduce best practices from other tech companies. but when contexts are not exactly the same nobody knows what to do. booking doesnt hire for independent thinkers or intelligence they hire for loyalty and people who wont ruffle too many feathers. when someone is a challenging type they are typically show ponies who just state the obvious in overly confident terms and unnecessary decks. the humble culture that booking likes to advertise based on its datadriven decision making is rather the oppositei found a certain arrogance in always following data in a bubble without considering longterm consequences or contexts. in all i saw far too much nepotism friendshiringfriends and stating of the obvious to really consider booking a serious tech company with a straight face. their founder made a business model that worked they optimize the hell out of it and have more money to spend than anyone else. so it works for now almost in spite of many of the people it hires rather than because of them. if youre a fresh graduate its a great place. youll do rotation programs and most likely be given a leadership position within a few years so long as you brainwash yourself into the lingo. if you are a midcareer hire you will likely end up reporting to one of those inexperienced former fresh graduates who have no realworld business skills or experiences outside of booking and suffer for it.,Booking.com
