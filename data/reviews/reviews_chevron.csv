Many supervisors have a control issue. If you say one thing, they will make you do the opposite just so they can be right. I have heard from peers that the HR hotline number is useless, only creates more trouble and should never be used even though the company promotes the hotline. Inflexible work schedule.

Because of longevity of the people that work for the company (a good thing) there is a lot of mindset on outdated logic, process, and procedures, although Chevron recognized this and has been making conscience effort to migrate this and adjust this mindset.

It's also so slow that employees don't get rankings and pay increases until many months after the fact. Advice - quickly adopt a more nimble and innovative talent management system. The PMP process is too out-dated and younger employees will not have the patience for this kind of system. - Decision-making can be painfully slow with snaking, meetings before meetings, and circling back with stakeholders to a seemingly endless degree. Make a decision and go execute--fail fast if need be. There is such an aversion to risk that it can become mind numbing at times. Again, the younger workforce will not stick around and they are used to and expect a far faster pace. - There is a committee looking at how to to become faster and more nimble...that alone is telling.

Get experience when working here, then leave to get a better job.""",1.0,"First off, Chevron Stations and other departments of Chevron should be separated because they are not the same. Chevron Stations is overloaded with low salary people who slack off during work, and who don't care about their jobs. - Can slack off and do nothing while getting paid, because the managers themselves slack off themselves and let others to do so as well. - Can break practically any rule of Chevron that you want because the managers don't care if you do so or not because they don't care for the company. - Free fountain drinks.","- Management and Chevron corporate allow harassment to other employees and nothing will happen to them if you report them. - Management is ruled by people with GEDS, or by the ones that barely passed high school. Thus, management at Chevron have low intelligence. - Management don't care about their job. - Salary is low from start to finish. You start making at exactly minimum wage, and increase by .25 cents every year, and capping to at most 1 or 2 dollars more than the minimum wage. - If you are a hard coworker management and corporate will just make you do all of the work there while the others are allowed to slack off. So basically, you work while the others get paid the same to do nothing. So, in the end why work well at all? - In Oregon you have to pump gas. If you can pump gas well and fast, you be made to pump gas forever. Its harder work than working inside the store. Practically no one likes pumping gas, so you will have like 6 people working and 5 people inside the store talking to each other while you have to pump gas alone outside handling all of the gas pumps. - Management are huge slackers. I had one who just stayed inside the office and was on their cell phone all day. - Management will talk to you and get angry at you if you get a customer complaint, but will completely ignore customer complaints about themselves. - Corporate doesn't care about you, even if they say they do. Your just a pile of replaceable trash to them. They will easily replace you with some guy who's desperate for a job if you don't like your job. - Benefits are a scam. They never give tuition reimbursement to anyone who works at Chevron Stations. I never got it, and no one that I've heard that applied to it has ever gotten it. They don't even give a reason as to why you didn't get it. They just don't want to give you money for tuition. So if your planning to work at Chevron for the tuition reimbursement, I suggest you look elsewhere at a different company. - No tips by the way. If you get a tip and accept it you will get in trouble. But if management gets a tip they will take it and tell you to back off if you say something. - Your salary is still low if you become management. - Management can't do math, can't read, and can't write. I had a manager who asked me how to spell out a basic word that is learned in like 2nd or 3rd grade. They couldn't even write a paragraph, and had to use a calculator for basic math. - You may get split days off if your not a favorite of management, and you will also get your schedule changed in less than 24 hours if your not a favorite of management. - Management hires anyone who is willing to work. So the level of your coworkers may vary from people who are difficult to work with, and with huge slackers. I started off as someone who worked hard and well at Chevron Stations trying to actually get work done and well. In the end I ended up no caring because I was working while the others were allowed to slack off. Plus, I had a minimum wage salary. So, there's no reason to work well.",Chevron

Zero access to leading technology that is just common business from other industries. The IT group creates a 6 month roadblock when you try and introduce a new platform or program. Then another 6 month roadblock trying to get a contract signed to keep company information confidential. Our own standards don’t allow us to keep up with any industry leading programs. Instead we have our IT group create programs, which don’t take the input to a program from the groups that will use it. Then they don’t keep it updated. Everyone at the refineries talks about how the “Chevron Way” is being nice to everyone and not holding people accountable and just scraping by, but no one does anything about it. A lot of people just going with the flow instead of pioneering new models and trying to improve the whole concept. Is that because we have a pension and good pay so people just want to stay around? Sounds like a broken business plan. No one keeps track of any money. We have contractors sending in extra work that wasn’t in scope and they’re being paid for it. Because we don’t track anything. Contracts are written on time and material because we don’t want to do the CMCO process. Because we don’t know what is right versus wrong. We’re lazy so time and material is easier. A contractors dream come true. They finish jobs and submit them with 20% markup on both. A welder failed and had to gouge his welds out on Thursday and Friday? We’ll pay him double time to come in Saturday to fix his rejected work. We literally have no idea how to manage contractors and we let slide by every year. There are plenty of PSG-22/23s that are Team Leads and second level managers that have no idea how to manage. This is something that seriously needs fixed. How can the future leaders be bred when they’re lead by poor individuals? The future of Chevron depends on the internal growth of upcoming employees. Proper leadership trainings needs to happen to the 22/23s. The annual review process needs tweaking. The ranks are 3, 2- , 2 , 2+ and 1. 1s being the stellar ones and 3 being the turds. The issue is someone who is on the boarder almost a 2- and someone on the boarder of 2+ are both grouped as 2s. While in actual performance they are far from each other. Why do we not use 1-10?

There used to be great qualities about the jobs at this company which have been all lost with bad management and poor decisions.,"- Continuous over-hiring and laying off trend never ended over the three years putting all employees at the edge of their seats and making it a very uncomfortable environment to work at. - Bad ranking system. The ranking system takes your performance evaluation into account and gives you a score to determine your next year's salary. This ranking and performance evaluation is not standard across the company or even the business unit. You are always in the hands of your higher management and they will throw you under the bus when a scapegoat is needed for any reason. You may accomplish everything they put into your performance agreement in the beginning of the year and more; help other employees, work groups, managers, but it doesn't get recognized especially if your manager or some other managers you worked with talk adversely of you. - Constant comparative environment which promotes individualism, but not teamwork. They continuously race and compare you to the similar salary grade coworkers. They treat you like a race horse year after year. - No good structural organization system has been in place for years knowing the ups and downs of the oil price effects on economics. The moment oil prices dip, this company is ready to lay off their employees immediately. - All the company cares for is their stock prices. In order not to sacrifice stock prices, they will sacrifice employees at any time. Makes you feel very worthless and not valued whatsoever. Meanwhile, I've seen so many processes rolled out and have been taken out in a few years or less because they never were fit for purpose. They were just time-wasters for everyone while the company tried to look good outside. - There is an overload of meetings. If you do not setup meetings, you are not perceived as working although you are actually self-sufficient and know how to plan, manage your time, work along with your coworkers' work. The meetings in this company is a waste of time 99% of the time. Moreover, you have to listen to the same safety briefings over and over and over. - When you do your work, it is always for the upper management. Your supervisor takes the credit. Your supervisor requests the work that is asked from the upper management. You do all the work and the supervisor presents the work and receives the credit. - I've seen lead engineers make up numbers to save their backs in reporting to the upper management. This is 100% unethical, but the rest of the team won't say anything in fear of losing their jobs. - They non-stop talk about Chevron ways, transparency, teamwork. They don't follow none of which. - As a result of all of these cons, I've never seen so many professionals leave Chevron on their own including myself for the last 3 years. Especially after the so-called reorganization that was done at the end of 2017, they kept lower salary grade people whom had been completely miserable at the assignments and working situations they were placed at.",Chevron

This is a relationship and politics based culture that views performance as secondary, which means you have no chance relative to someone who has already been there 20 years. They hold positions exclusively for people from their own development program, even though they too are often ill equipped. The Chevron Way behavioral expectations lead to a friendly but artificial and passive-avoidant culture. About 50 percent of time is spent on bureaucracy vs real HR work.

People are paid in payscales (PSGs), which are based more on luck and how well you've schmoozed than the actual job you're doing. One person may be paid $100k to do a job, get back filled by someone making $150k (cause that's what they made previously), and then the next person in the role may only earn $90k. I've seen it happen countless times. It doesn't matter how qualified you are to do a particular job, if you haven't locked in the next PSG you don't get paid more to do higher level jobs. I can't stress enough how damaging this process is to morale. -Ridiculous cost cutting at every turn. -Some people phone it in every day, and others at the same payscale work ridiculous hours. Again, pay has nothing to do with the difficulty of the job or how hard you work. I have friends at Chevron who spend half their day on the internet, others who work until 1 am several times a month. All get paid roughly the same amount. -Recent MBA grads keep getting stuffed into the career ladder at the mid-management payscales meaning nobody else has any chance at getting promoted above senior analyst roles. This is something that picked up steam around 2012 and has caused a lot of friction internally. Despite constant offshoring, they haven't scaled back on these programs. -People are streaming for the exit. Of the 20 or so people at my level that I'm friends with outside of work, at least 12 have said they're passively looking for other jobs--and 6 of them have left in the last 18 months. -The CEO seems like a good guy, but the vibe of the company completely changed when he took over a few years ago.

I'm not even sure where to start. -They transferred the manager that was there when I first started, that set everything else in motion. Mostly. -The Assistant Manager was lazy and useless. -The manager they hired after they transferred the other, did not know how to deal with our store since it was different than their own (they had a smaller gas station store, we had more of a convenient store with hot food, coffee, etc). -The assistant manager was lazy and useless, and was no help to the new manager. individual also threw the former manager under the bus, claiming he didn't train her in this or that -The other manager either got fired or quite, I don't recall. We had an acting manager from a different store. -This manager, whom I had originally thought was pretty nice...was basically a wolf in sheeps clothing. Not in a good way. -Assistant Manager continued to be lazy and useless, and after speaking up a fair few times, was still able to retain her position... -I started getting blamed for things that I was not actually trained on, and then blamed for things not being done that I was, in my position, not allowed to do. Things that only managers and assistants can do. -I really started to hate my job -They hired a new guy to be the new manager, but he was in training -Acting manager liked to run her mouth and talk crap about employee's behind their backs, heard her doing so about me to the manager in training. -Acting manager got fired for forging assistant managers name on documents that the assistant manager never signed cause ""she didn't know"" she was supposed to (which, she did, cause she had before..) -Assistant manager then thought she was going to become the new manager. -Assistant manager then went from knowing nothing to apparently knowing her job...without further training -I worked mainly graveyard, and I would come in at night to NOTHING being done that the assistant manager was supposed to do if it was her shift. There are times she would work my graveyard on my nights off..I would come in the next day and things had not been done for a few days. -Assistant manager started training other employee's to be slackers. -Assistant manager cared more about flirting with guys than her job. -Assistant manager cared more about her phone than her job. -I got sick of this job, went from loving it to hating it, and stopped caring. I ended up quitting with no notice. -Assistant manager was still there a month and a half or so after I quit.. -...Not sure if assistant manager is still there, would not surprise me if she was",Chevron

It's a very technology-driven company, but ERP, IT and Finance support have all been offshored and/or outsourced, so issues are typically resolved slowly, especially since most service centers do NOT adapt their workdays to the U.S. I was with Chevron for nearly 20 years, and during that time I saw a disturbing change in developing talent. In the early days, talent was developed ""from the ground up,"" with candidates rotating positions every few years as they slowly worked their way up the corporate ladder. These days, only a few young recruits, typically from Ivy League schools, are placed on fast track ""development programs."" The recruits typically rotate positions every six months, enough to gain a basic understanding of the position, but not enough to be a group contributor. This has caused resentment among some employees, as they are passed up by a ""fast tracker"" that often knows far less about the business than they do. I've heard Chevron's success with ""development program"" candidates is marginal at best, as a significant number resign and pursue more lucrative opportunities with other companies. Oil is a very complex business, and the new HR model appears short-sighted and ultimately will result in a less knowledgeable and certainly less dedicated workforce.",Chevron
