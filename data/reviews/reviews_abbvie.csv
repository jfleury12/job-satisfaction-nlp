Advancement from within is virtually non-existent as people are hired from outside. Expectations are not establish or defined. Therefore accountability is not maintained allowing groups to continue working with a mindset that doesn't align with the corporate vision. The vision set by the CEO is not translating down to the plants. Management mistakes are clearly visible but action to reprimand or remove those from positions happens after damage is already done.

Extremely Toxic - Incessant mistrust and lack of cooperation among business units and coworkers even within the same dept. 2. Callous and Inhumane - Employees are virtually treated like dogs or slaves with a shocking disregard for human dignity, professional respect, and basic courtesy, let alone their occasional personal needs (health concerns or family obligations/emergencies). 3. Discriminatory - A senior executive in my functional area would drop F-bombs in conversations like handing out Halloween candy for Trick-or-Treat even in presence of female subordinates or peers... with total impunity! Lower level employees wouldn't even dare to engage in such behavior for the fear of legitimate legal action (including termination). 4. Stubbornly old-school - Lower level employees are required to show up at work everyday irrespective of their personal needs (health issues, child-care related emergencies, home/auto repairs, etc.) even when modern computing and internet technologies make it possible and easy to work remotely. Management simply doesn't trust people when they occasionally request permission to work remotely. It's ALWAYS my way or the highway. 5. Micromanaging - It's an understatement. Nano-managing would be more appropriate. Despite my two Masters degrees from two large, well-known U.S. state universities, I was not even allowed to directly engage with internal customers either over the phone, in person, or via email without my direct manager's knowledge and approval! 6. Callous and Inhumane - A hard-working coworker, an Abbvie lifer, was punished with no pay for taking longer time than initially expected for recovering from a surgery at a relatively old age.

577,"""Great Place To Work?""",3.0,Salaries and benefits are competitive. Career progression is feasible but it helps to know the right persons in Head office to promote your career.,Some people from the senior management team in HO have been around far too long.

581,"""So so""",3.0,"Budgets and benefits are still huge, it is like pharma used to be 20 years ago. If you work on Humira you will never have any problems acquiring budgets or resources. That's why the overall environment and work-life balance is great.","If you are not working on Humira, nobody will care for you. You woill not get budgets and resources, career opportunities are very limited. Senior Management has absolutely no clue. A lot of the leadership team do not belong in these positions and it is absolutely unclear why these people are there - they definitely did not get promoted due to their performace... Extremely political environment - if you do not play the games and praise leadership you career is over.",AbbVie

583,"""Manager""",3.0,Good current product portfolio and some good team managers within the local organisation.

584,"""Beware!""",1.0,Decent salary Appears to be respected by customers,"Talks of work-life balance yet most employees working 12-14 hour days, including weekends. Very much a 'face-fits' organisation. 'Blocks' of new starters moving en-masse from one company to the next. Claims that the patient comes first.....unsubstantiated.",AbbVie
585,"""Hearts in the right place...""",2.0,"Have been with Abbvie for over a year, its been a great place to work but i think this can vary depending on where in the business you are. I work with commercial teams which is often high pace and very demanding. Pros include: Great Renumeration, Flexible Work, Great tech setup to enable working wherever. Good variety (in my role that is) This opinion is based on my experiences","Was a very happy employee until my boss moved role overnight, new management have begun changing the fundamental workings of my role without me getting any real say, has been a downward slide ever since. Unfortunately totally disengaged me from the business, no personal growth, no visible further prospects for my expertise, not good. Fragmented - Huge matrix working with lots of role manouvres makes actually delivering projects sometimes impossible, also the knowledge is consistently shifting around and overnight moves make handovers challenging reducing output consistency Focused intensely on culture - Bucketing things up and aligning surveys is somewhere along the way losing the people. Also your goals are against the culture values, Favoritism - Bumped down to an area that I was not brought in to perform and witnessing others getting pick of projects etc as demonstrated clear imbalances in my perception or fairness and collective working. This opinion is based on my experiences",AbbVie

It can sometimes affect work performance.",AbbVie
590,"""More agility and external orientation""",4.0,"Great place to work with amazing people, solid comp package and international opportunities. Travel budgets are generous and we like to see each other in person rather than replying on technology.
