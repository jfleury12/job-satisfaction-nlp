Peter and his leadership team have done a reorg every 6 weeks it seems - the level of instability this creates means that people are constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop.

The head at the time said in team meetings more than once that all of the people who left the department for better opportunities were losers. I have news for her, almost all of the people who left have now gone on to much more successful jobs, no credit to her. She also made up reasons to give poor ratings, even when our own managers disagreed. They had a forced ratings distribution, and if you are new to the job or newly promoted, would give you a poor rating. That is really demotivating. When I brought proof of my performance, she didn't want to hear it. She was determined to give me a particular rating, and created a narrative to support it. My life was a living h3ll under her and when I tried to move internally and worked night and day to help them transition and document my work for an entire month, decided they wanted to keep me yet another month. I had to threaten to quit to be allowed to move on. And this is a person who made it very clear that she thought I was useless. Why try to keep me then? there was also a lack of trust on her part, and people weren't allowed to work from home or get certification if they didn't have a high rating. But it is impossible to break out of this box, if she has decided that you deserve a poor rating. She would also overturn my audit results, saying that it was more important to keep the client relationship. I agree, partnership with the business is very important, but that doesn't mean that we should just give a good rating if there's a weakness, does it? I will never forget the way she treated one of my hardest working coworkers, either. Turnover was really high, and I don't think that hard work will be appreciated there.

Several of the managers have been with the company a very long time and refuse to change, so they should probably be replaced. But no one looks at management's performance only their salaries when it is time to reduce staff. 3) If you EVER have any sort of problem with ANYTHING it is best you keep it to yourself, management will target you for ANY issue or concern you bring to them, no matter what the issue is. And other employees and consultants CANNOT BE TRUSTED keep your complaints to yourself. 4) Lake of cohesiveness amongst teams/coworkers or anyone else that works within the same business unit.- This is not enforced from an executive level team so it is not enforced anywhere else within the company. 5) Cannot trust or accurately train new team members/co-workers for fear of being replaced by that person because management is so sneaky and underhanded. Nor can you share work for the same reason.-- this is known or felt throughout the entire company by MANY employees. 6) Incentives, bonuses, is not based on your work merit or job performance but more on your likeability with management. You could be dumb as a rock and your work output erroneous and low level with very little effort and concern for a job well done and management will worship the ground you walk on with incentives, raises, bonuses, comfort in knowing your role is secure. it's is almost as if management is jealous or hateful of you if you take pride in your work and give 110%--but at the end of the day no one cares how good or great your work is only how much your are liked. 7) Work Morale is extremely low on a very regular basis as a result of all of the above. 8) The ability to advance from within is a joke. Talent Acquisition almost never selects or considers a candidate from within 9) The company overall has poor values and does not appreciate their employees. 10) The technology and process used are so dated that it is difficult for you to find a new job with the lackluster skills and experience you acquire or retain as a result of working for this company. Had I known this before becoming employed I would not have accepted the offer. Just imagine being in a rut of a company that progressed very slowly compared to the rest of the industries and years later trying to find a new job only to find out your knowledge and skills acquired from your last employer are outdated because there is no growth provided from the company. no training. old resources, outdated software and equipment",AIG

If you don’t believe me, just ask around and you’ll confirm this. The pay is low, the hours are horrible and the work environment is not pleasant. One of their many tricks is to offer large bonuses- based on performance, of course. You won’t get your review/bonus until the very end of March the following year, so they can squeeze three more months out of you before giving your review. You will receive nothing in writing until your year-end, and any mid-year reviews will strangely just be you and your manager (no witnesses). When I requested to receive my mid-year in writing, my director lied right to my face and he would and never did, and never had any intention of doing so. Later he tried lying about the fact that a certain percentage of people had to get low reviews, but he didn’t realize I’d already seen the email from the CEO confirming this. Basically they’ll lie right to your face, over and over, and have no problem with it as long as it furthers their ends. The turnover in internal audit has to be over 40% per year. People get discouraged and quit all the time. I’d say the average person lasts about 12-18 months and they burn out. Cycle, rinse, repeat. Of course, they spend a lot of time at recruiting events, and this should tell you something. If they are so great to work for, why do they need recruiters? They should have let this company go under in 2008.",AIG

Company does not pay you a cent to service hundreds of legacy accounts that are service intensive & your responsibility. You pay for 100% of your expenses, car, insurance, gas and tolls. Company has been slashing it's Advisor Compensation annually across the board for the last 10 years! This practice only causes more advisors to quit because financially they can't survive and meet their household obligations. Advisor turnover has been the number 1 problem at VALIC for the last 20 years. Management picks its ""Pet Advisors"" (favorites) Nationally and gives them the best groups, hospitals, large universities & municipalities. VALIC client assets are NOT sticky (no loyalty) & transfer out daily. Many clients are pure interest rate shoppers and they go to the best rates period! When high balance clients retire many take their money with them to their ""other guy/girl advisor"" who will manage it for them, now that you advised, reviewed, and annually encouraged them to save & accumulate hundreds of thousands $ for decades. For every large $ contributing client that retires you need 20 new clients in order replace the reoccurring income of that 1. Sad but true this place has turned into a 100% commission sales job. VALIC as a company is A-Okay with you and your family having no safety net financially, as they have literally stollen advisor reoccurring compensation routinely for years. I have easily witnessed 100 plus advisors hired & fired or voluntarily quit because they can't pay their bills. VALIC's management are highly compensated individuals who are not in touch with reality, and their focus is on their sales goals and year end bonus! Management just wants the ""business/new assets."" Management's attitude is get the money at all costs.... Upper level management regularly preaches from their soapboxes that ""advisor books of business are gold mines"" and ""all advisors have the same opportunities"" Both statements are 150% FALSE! If this was the case FA's looking for employment would be breaking down VALIC's doors for jobs and that is not the problem here.(remember high FA turnover) Management also claims that VALIC has all the same products, resources & planning tools that the big wire houses offer and we should let our clients know about these valuable resources. This statement is also false, VALIC is an insurance company and 100% of our offerings are annuities & life insurance. Management can ""take"" your clients away at any time.

The bonuses were very high compared to other insurance companies in the area.,The worst place I've ever worked as far as people wanting to work together as a team. Every man for himself mentality.

1271,"""Former Summer Intern""",2.0,My team was very friendly and easy to work with. My mentor gave me a variety of different projects to work on throughout the summer.,"AIG was not transparent about the path to full time employment. They definitely hired more interns than they could take on for full time roles, which meant that the final decision was not based on performance. Many high performing interns did not get full time offers. Offer status was also communicated two months after the expected date. Also, many full time employees acknowledged that politics play a huge role at the firm. It was also very difficult to see the big picture of what you're doing at the firm. The structure of the firm is very complex, and it was difficult to get information about the organizational structure from managers. Each team seems to operate as its own entity, and there doesn't seem to be a sense of unity throughout the company. Instead, each group has its own culture and own methodology. Managers were often too busy to manage the development of their interns, and I had very little interaction with my manager throughout the summer. I didn't get the sense that managers cared about our growth and success.",AIG
