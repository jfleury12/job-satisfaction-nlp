6,"""Great Company""",5.0,"This is a great company to work for, and allows for flexibility when needed.",None to share really. The company is great. Since GDIT took over CSRA the benefits and vacation time has been cut though for low level employees and health care costs also went up.,General Dynamics
7,"""GDIT is genuinely cares for the employees.""",5.0,"GDIT seems to truly care about people in that in a short time I have been here I have been offered soft skills Training, Certification Training, Growth opportunities, Conference attendance as well as time to work and think innovatively.",Some of the support elements are not quite as good as I am used to for example the help desk.,General Dynamics

Benefits are generally competitive, but we'll need to keep an eye on them.",The acquisition of CSRA is still shaking up the organization. The 2020 benefits plan severely hurt many of the lower-paid former CSRA staff. The benefits conversion over the turn of the year had more problems that it should have and was exacerbated by poor to nonexistent communications from HR. This is the reason I currently can't recommend GDIT for employment.,General Dynamics
18,"""Not Too Shaby""",3.0,"Subjective: What are you qualifications? Are your looking for DoD contracting, or are you looking at the organization directly? (I am DoD contracting). -As a DoD contractor I got: --A cushy Baltimore/DC pay check to meet E4 pay after separation with A+, Sec+, had to get MTA, and some service desk experience (explained) that supported the Army (INSCOM). (SUBJECTIVE) --Found a qualified job in Alabama that got me closer to home (+k moving allowance to find my now home)","Lack of company driven deposits on employees. All training for information technology (IT) was designed, gained, insisted on you staying longer on the contract or with GDIT on a basis(?) -This makes sense because they invested in keeping people.

GDIT holds so very many contracts there are tons of opportunities to get your foot in the door.,"No real opportunity for growth. Lack of competitive salaries. Lack of comprehension that employees are not military. Hostile, toxic, and, unprofessional work environment.

My team is great, with lots of interesting people who are willing to help out. Overall a decent place to work out of university, but would not recommend putting a stop to the job hunt for too long after starting. 401k is good if you are able to put in a solid chunk of your paycheck.","Below market pay and bad benefits (except the 401k). Education benefits are a joke, and it honestly shocks me that a company of this size and prestige cares so little about the younger section of their workforce. Healthcare plans are either expensive or garbage. Transportation benefits, which I've always been offered in large cities, are non-existent.",General Dynamics

28,"""Okay Company""",2.0,Several contracts so work is there.,"Lack of support from upper management. Conflicting views from upper management, compensation is not competitive.

32,"""On a downhill trend""",2.0,"Big company, generally able to find a new contract","General Dynamics has multiple subsidiaries, most of which sell hardware (planes, submarines, tanks, etc.). Hardware is great revenue, but small profit. GDIT sells expertise, which is lower revenue but higher profit. So, GDIT supplies cash to the rest of GD. What does this mean? It means that GDIT's focus is on saving money. For example: - annual raises are below inflation rate - severe cutbacks to health insurance choices...most employees were given a choice of (at most) two providers, many only had one choice. - health insurance: much higher premiums than before, much more limited pharmacy benefits - performance bonuses were cut without explanation - internal help desk has a permanent ""wait times are longer than usual"" message...tickets are closed without every contacting the user, etc. - they slashed tuition reimbursement by over half, with no explanation - the company no longer reimburses for certifications, has to come out of projects (even though proposals demand certs) Most places you look within the company, cost cutting is having a significant negative impact. For solution architects, the growth strategy is 'bid everything', but they haven't hired enough SAs to support, so we routinely are doing 50-60 hour weeks, burning everyone out. Plus, when they interview experienced SAs, they won't pay market rate, so we end up focused only on growing from within, so have a few experienced SAs and multiple inexperienced SAs. Lastly, apparently there were too many discussions of complaints on the internal enterprise social media, so they're shutting it down.",General Dynamics

The time off is given out in little bits per each day that you work. You don't get say, 20 days off per year, plus holidays, all at the start of the year. No, you have to wait for little slices of time to all add up so you can finally have a vacation or days off. Things have gotten worse since the merger with another company, I hear from current employees. Also, don't ever expect GDIT to help out if a family member of yours gets a disease or needs long term care. GDIT will expect you to be at work all day, every day. Just be prepared to be chained to the oar and rowing all the time. Personal time? Naw. Will they even give you a card when someone in your immediate or extended family dies? Forget it. Oh, and if you happen to be a person of color or other protected class, remember that I have heard persons who are not in a protected class making off-color and thick-skinned jokes, making fun of others in their groups, disrespecting gender differences, and the whole gamut of unacceptable behaviors. Then, they turn around and 'slap down' anything that they imagine to be out of order from people who are of color, or of a different gender than 'white males.' The most cold and heartless place that I have ever worked. Worse than IBM by a long shot. Worst run place, ever. They like to tout how great they are, but money is their ONLY GOAL.

People do bare minimum and there is no balance in workload. Plus many of them are jerks and lack the ability to work within teams. From what I can tell everything (title, projects,compensation) is based solely on tenure vs. what you contribute. I dont think you can get fired here, people know that and some take advantage while others are stuck holding up the team.

CSRA now GDIT is a good company. CSRA has a major management problem--and an even bigger diversity problem. Managers too often focusing on managing up to senior management, not down to employees. They've lost touch with their employees needs. There is little to no focus on growth, opportunity, employee development, or even basic things, like health and wellbeing. There is salary disparity. Too often policies and guidelines around performance, merit increases and growth opportunities are intentionally kept unwritten so the managers can apply them to benefit their ""favorites."" Every employee knows who the favorites are and if asked, they will name the same people. It's blatant behavior. Almost patronage. Minority employees face subtle to over discriminatory behaviors and face constant prejudice and bias, no matter how highly qualified you are, no matter how advanced your degrees. There is no clear mechanism to report it in any way or to any one that employees will feel they will be believed and heard. No one is so overt to drop the N word, they just treat you that way in small ways, every single day. You'll learn to maneuver within this environment but you shouldn't have to. There is a clear, unpenetrable ""old boys"" network at the leadership level and until there is more diversity among management, this problem cannot be fixed and likely won't be addressed in any meaningful way. I've seen some changes under Amy's leadership that strike me as positive but so much more is needed--and faster. This company has lost of a lot of good people at the worker level and there is another wave coming. Many people would've left the company but stayed only for the hope of change under GDIT. Many have stopped holding their breath. I cannot recommend this company (on the CSRA side) to any person of color at this time, regardless of your experience, skills and degrees. You think that will change perceptions. It won't. Find a company that has a clear and real focus on diversity and inclusion.

Upper management doesn't respond to your inquiries unless another superior above them contacts them for you. Managers doesn't respond to emails or phone calls, you have to continuously call (at least 5 or 6 times to get an answer) and forward emails (at least 3 or 4 times) hoping that you get a response. When you do, its normally after a deadline has passed and you have been penalized for not meeting the metric requirements, and of course if you don't, you don't get a pay raise. Imagine that, doing all of the field work and not getting a pay raise because your managers lack of communication. The manager is never penalized for their lack of communication or lack of professionalism but sends out weekly emails out for individuals to meet the metric requirements, what sense does that make? For this job as a background investigator, they tell that you they will reimburse you for mileage since you drive your personal car and that they will give you a credit card for job related expenses (parking, obtaining records etc etc). BI's are told that they would drive in any direction up to 40 miles (this was reasonable since we are driving our personal vehicles), this has dramatically changed to 100+ miles in any direction, truth is drive wherever as long as you don't end up in another state. And the reimbursement for mileage is a lie. When you put in your for mileage reimbursement, they subtract that from the job related expenses that you had to use the credit card for, like parking or obtaining records. For example, say you drove 90 miles, the total reimbursement for that would be $45.00 and you used the credit card to pay for gas to drive those 90 miles, say that equals $35.00 and then you pay $10.00 for parking, so your overall total is $45.00, yeah you guessed it, you don't any reimbursement for using your personal vehicle, it all goes to the company card that you had to use to do the job. The background investigator gets NOTHING. And when you talk to the manager, they tell to you drive even further. This company is going downhill, it is always being bought out by another company (3x times since I've been here). It sucks and they take advantage of their employees. The job stress is high because of the lack of communication and constant reminders of metrics that you can never meet because your manager, and yes, you get days off and great benefits but at the cost of constantly being stressed?

The user's don't even look at the requirements when testing. They see something they want and they enter a bug. It doesn't matter that it wasn't in the requirements and is a enhancement. It is reported as a bug. They have said I quote ""We expect zero bugs before we accept the software"". Enhancements are counted as bugs so unless you can read minds you are doomed to failure. If they have a database problem, you are blamed. Developers have to fix database issues because DBAs won't come in on the weekends. When the production database was rolled back to the integration database so they would be in sync.

We got an extra stipend to buy our own insurance. The atmosphere was relaxed and everyone treated each other respectfully. Fast forward to present day, there is no support from supervisors or managers. Most supervisors are uneducated on the policies and systems so if there is a problem its expected you will figure it out on your own. The managers have no clue as to what is going on in the call center let alone what the calls are about. The metrics used to score your performance like attendance, schedule adherence, and average handle time are automatically entered by the system but are never accurate. This has been admitted to call center representatives by upper management but they also informed us nothing would be done about it. To add insult to injury, this incorrect information that is used determines your work schedule for the next 6 months. However there is a way around getting a horrible shift. If you apply for FMLA it's the untouchable key to success. Just go to your doctor and have them write a note saying you can't work past a certain time or that they have to see you during the day so you can't work past 5 pm. Unfortunately for people like myself who would prefer to be honest and not lie about their medical condition, it leaves us with the undesirable shift choices. If there were to be an investigation into the amount of FMLA used it would be mostly for illegitimate reasons. The calls are non stop. For senior representatives like myself we are forced to be on the phone constantly with no breathing room while watching lower level representatives have time off the phone that they are supposed to use for reviewing policies but instead it is used for roaming the call center. This is true for anyone doing training because no one keeps up with the amount of time someone is in the training module. Walk around and do nothing however bill the contract customer that we are doing work, which is actually stealing time and a serious offense. Since there is mass favoritism however, this never gets reported by managers that see it occuring. As senior representatives we also take every call possible from helping lower representatives answer caller questions to irate customers. We are even responsible for calling customers back when the lower representatives hang up on the customer, even if it's intentional. This normally happens around their breaks and lunches so that they can go on time, which inevitably causes us to be late on our own schedule. Even though it has the ability to be tracked, as stated earlier there are no repercussions towards these representatives because the supervisors do not care to do any more work than the bare minimum. The time off policy is standard but still does not make accommodations for life. You only accrue 1 hour and 12 minutes of sick time every 2 weeks. Heaven forbid you or your child are sick. The sites never close during inclement weather, even during Governor declared state of emergency times. You will be penalized for not coming in, however they will pay for upper management to stay in hotels across the street so that they can open the site for business. You will not only be penalized but also forced to use any paid vacation time you have until it is exhausted. You are not allowed to choose to not get paid for an absence if you have the time to cover it. In the site where I work they are basing the pay scale based on the poor city area nearby instead of the affluent area where the center is actually located. This allows them to pay less to the workers (mainly minorities of the African American decent) and then blame it on the Department of Labor when there are no raises. Since this is a government contract, it boggles the mind that they would use such deceptive practices. Along the lines of benefits, the employee only plan is free but to cover a spouse and children it's $460+ every 2 weeks for the HMO and $700+ every 2 weeks for the PPO. Background checks must clear before getting on the phones but this is a recent change. The contract is awarded and kept based on how many people they have in seats, not taking experience, education or professionalism into consideration. This means they hire mostly anyone who applies. So before, many background checks cleared after training and already having been on the phone so because of that sometimes convicted felons end up working in the different sites. Did I mention that we work with people's social security numbers? They are eventually found out but not before they are already on the phone so the damage is pretty much done.

It was nearly impossible for bilingual workers to get time off approved. The company was more worried about employees sticking to their break schedule than providing proper customer service.-If you had a call that went past your scheduled break time it would count against your adherance which had to be 90% or better, which is fine but when calls can last over an hour it can hurt your adherance in just 1 call.

1871,"""Defense Contracting is not for everybody""",4.0,"GDIT knows how to work numbers like magic. Salaries in this particular contract are probably above and beyond what would be considered 'fair and reasonable', but there are drawbacks (explained in the Cons). If you are lucky enough to get onboard with a good crew, the overall welfare and moral of the entire site is extremely high. Not that there weren't any hardships in my career so far, but this job, in combination of the site and the crew, is one of the easiest jobs I have ever taken.","On the other hand, one of the biggest drawbacks is the way GDIT negotiates the contracts. I would almost welcome a cut-back in salary to earn a few more hours of leave. We are provided a limited number of hours of ""general leave"", which we have to use for everything, including vacations, sick days, family 'urgencies' (family emergencies are covered under the FMLA, which isn't paid), doctor appointments... Literally everything. You would be surprised how fast 2 weeks of paid leave is used up when you need to use it anytime that you're not onsite when you are contracted to be there. Also, the job is not difficult, and at our site we are not particularly busy all of the time. But if our customer has a day off, why are we still required to work? There are at least 3 days per year when our customer is out of office, which means we have no other tenants onsite, which also means that there is usually no work that can be performed. Keeping us onsite when there is no one else around is a waste of fuel and energy, AND it takes yet another day away from us when we could be using the day to handle our personal business (as opposed to taking leave and handling it when our customer actually needs us). One final note is that the listed job descriptions for each position is not concrete, nor are they final. There seems to be a lot of tasks that get filed under ""other duties as assigned"" because they are contractual requirements. For example, technicians and engineers are frequently required to instruct classes, even though there are dedicated instructors. Often the actual instructors are over-tasked, so other personnel usually step up to take up the slack even though it is not in their job description. Since instruction and training is our primary contract focus, everyone, including engineers and administrators, usually end up teaching a class or two just to satisfy the contract. The contract stuff such as the benefits and the job descriptions are not exactly GDIT's fault. This contract that I am currently on is actually a subcontract from another company, and they are the ones that dictate what GDIT can offer us. I haven't worked for any other contract or division within GDIT, so much of my personal experiences may not necessarily reflect ""the norm"", but rather ""the exception"".

Very intrusive and demoralizing to morale. Company tries to scare off or fire people the last two years of the contract so they can be more competitive for the next contract- all that happens is the hard workers and knowledgeable staff leave and you have to do 3-4 jobs to make up the loss of those employees Absolutely ZERO employer loyalty to employees. Managers are all yes men who beat you up to get their misguided agendas/projects done and threaten to fire you if you don't comply. Good old boy network, management hires their buddies who most have no management skill or technical understanding. No one ever moves up, and the few that do get carrot dangling in front of them for salary increase until they get fed up and quit. New people not up to par with what is required to perform tasks. Problem employees allowed to create havoc and never get written up or counseled/removed. Pay raises ludicrous as seasoned staff gets less than one percent and clueless newcomers get 5%. Make you stay for three years by holding your relocation/repatriation back to US hostage. All other companies require only one year -this one requires 3. 401k a joke, they take it all back if you quit one day before being vested for the measly 3% they give you. Two years ago, payroll forgot to take out 401k deductions for a pay period and told people they had to do it themselves. Law does not allow you to do this so you lost one months deposit to your plan. HR non existent and doesn't work for you as a worker but for management. HR seems like they can never find people to come work for them in Overseas. Hundreds of open jobs and seldom any new hires. Extremely oppressive environment where most shops do nothing but look busy watching TV and push their work down lower shops shop whose managers have no clue how to fight back and not take it. Example is HD personnel doing network and IA shops job. Management totally condones this. Work entails putting out fires rather than being proactive and avoiding fires.

Decent benefits, average or below pay. Ability to work independently.","Mid level managers that you only see or talk to a few times a year, which is great unless you need them to go to bat for you. Mid level management is uninvolved and often clueless and unconcerned about what is going on the ground. Managers hire unqualified people (called ""rockstars"" ) from other unrelated fields who lack the background or skills to do the job. Many positions are sinecures (warm bodies) for fluff govt contracts, in organizations that have no clear direction or purpose. People in those positions make it very difficult to get work accomplished if you must depend on their contribution to a task or project. No consequence for poor performance, contributes to poor work ethic/office culture. Serious minded people get punished for rocking the boat.",General Dynamics

2035,"""Do you really want to work for the gov't?""",2.0,Good teamwork within a contract. Still feels like a growing company. Benefits are pretty good. Work environment is comfortable. Better than being unemployed.,"Working for the gov't involves lots(!) of red tape and more documentation than I thought possible. Don't get me wrong, I understand the importance of documentation but what they require is just over the top. For such a large company they are extremely cheap about spending money on IT. Funding for basic IT needs gets charged to contracts rather than overhead which leads to a tenuous situation when the contract ends regarding the disposition of hardware/software. Pay is a little on the low side. The level of IT knowledge seems to be on the lower side. I don't consider myself a guru on anything but I had to explain simple things like VLANs to my office several times (and I'm still not sure they 'get it').",General Dynamics

If you have a good PM you will be well taken care of - GDIT seems to ""take care of its own"" and is generally a great work/life balance place where emphasis is on working smarter, not harder.","Due to its size, the many different projects and programs tend to operate quasi-independently - a bad experience at one project doesn't necessarily reflect on GDIT as a whole, but that particular project. That being said - you can be ""just a number"" given the size of the company. Recent acquisitions mean that some leaders come from ""body shop"" companies - they seem to be more interested in winning and keeping contracts rather than their employees.

There will be times when travelling that you will need to work long hours....but the work is 'big' and important and you will have no problem doing so. The company will pay for additional training if you are there long enough. It is really dependent on what type of manager you have. I didn't receive permission for training, but a couple of guys who quit after attending boot camps to get Cisco CCNP were paid for training.","Managers who won't approve travel expenses till several weeks after the trip. Managers who will only approve FAA pay (upfront expenses for 30 days) till after the 30 days are up. Some project managers are extreme at micro-managing. Very poor at communicating what is happening. Plan on not knowing if you are going to travel till the day before. Plan on explaining every expense. For gas purchases while on the road, you don't need to submit a copy of the receipt. However, when entering that info into expense form...you must type a note explaining what, where, when, and why. Lets see...American Express says it is gas purchased at Exxon in Atlanta. So your note would read. While working on the such and such project in Atlanta, Georgia, my car was running low on gasoline and I had to purchase more. For purchase of food at lunch...there would be a receipt for 9.00 at Richie's Deli....so your explanation would read....on jan 3, 2009, I ate lunch at Richie's Deli in Atlanta, Georgia while working on such and such project for GDIT.
