Everytime I received either of these I requested assistance which I am sure was hard on them but, it was harder on me since they would come key it in so fast that I could not see how to do it. At one point the asst. manager who told me I was trained had me in tears that i had to leave the register. That person is no longer there nor, am I. I did not need that job that bad. I would have loved to have been trained correctly but, they were in a hurry to hire as many as possible that they looked over that. Personally, I do not feel that training by listening to a computer read for me is sufficient. IN addition, to that issue there were registers that did not operate correctly so getting on these was like stepping back to Bedrock with Fred. Let me rub my rocks together and see if a price comes out. The managers were aloof assistant managers and managers were in their own world. They the assistant managers had a tendency of getting in a group in front of the registers and chatting. I find that to be a waste of time. They need to be more than visible statues.

432,"""Appalling, dishonest, unethical and the most unprofessional company I have ever worked for""",1.0,Kroger plus card and some nice employees who unfortunately have to stay employed there.,"This is the most discriminatory company I have ever worked for. First off they have very high turnover and will hire anything because they’re desperate. They run there good help off because of a lack of professionalism and poor treatment. This store in particular runs like it’s in a third world country and the management is ignorant and unscrupulous. They have no sense of morals or integrity. I was a cheese shop manager successfully for a year and a half. When I took on the role In September 2017 the store was beautiful and it was a pretty nice job while I was in college. I would constantly get praised for my hard work and for increasing the sales. In the winter of 2018 the management hands switched and all hell broke loose. The morale declined and management pretty much began to send the message that they don't care about their employees. The current management has no regard for black people and will single one out as a manager in the morning huddles of a predominantly white staff for no apparent reason. When you file a complaint for this inappropriate behavior the store management and the whole district will retaliate against you. They will do anything from sabotage, lots of dishonesty, set ups, harassing, bullying, degrading, disrespecting, trying to make you feel incompetent and singling you out more to try to justify their wrong doing. I actually began to believe that the whole company was made up of people with mental disorders. What’s appalling is that instead of the district trying to resolve the issue in an amicable way, they condone it and all begin working in concert aiding in the activity. I have a bachelor’s degree and after I made this legitimate complaint, this company did everything under the sun to try to make me look stupid and tear me down. These people have this hideous idea that they are intelligent but this is just a grocery store and at the end of the day it shows where their intelligence lies when after two years they discover a manager is incompetent because they made a legitimate complaint. This was a very hostile working environment and I was more than happy to terminate my employment from that nasty company.

I find a good number of my coworkers likeable, but that is usually how I feel, so I don't regard that as a pro of Kroger. The union can be decent in some situations.","The worst thing about Kroger is the customers -- everyone has to buy food, so you get a bit of everyone (which is a bad thing). Everywhere I have worked, there have of course been some unpleasant customers, but in my other jobs, there has generally been a type of person I am working for, or in other retail, types of people who come in more than others. Literally the only reason I still work here is because I was moronic enough to stick around to the point of getting a lower management position. But I dont think the abuse I experienced to get there is worth the pay. As a gay man, I guess I have to say that if you are someone who is harassed by most varieties of people even without being in a service position, I would steer clear of working at grocery stores. Work somewhere where you get specific types of people who you can tolerate on some level. Also, Kroger advertises its healthcare advantages to people with disabilities and certain health conditions and I've seen a lot of these people exploited and not paid fairly (one of my coworkers worked for them before the minimum wage raised, and she at the time exhausted her raises they were going to give her ... which now add up to the current minimum wage. So she's worked for them for 15 years and is getting paid minimum wage, and in her frame of consciousness, she doesn't understand how wrong she's been done). Sexual orientation isn't included in their nondiscrimination policies so I only have rights under a local law that doesn't exist in most places. And they feel like they can get away with more because I would have to go legal before anything will be done in my defense. This is STRONGLY reflected in the judgment calls that the union makes. A lesbian coworker of mine stood up for herself and got fired for ""talking back"", and the union's landing position was that she could only be rehired after 3 months because apparently there had to have been some possibly illegal communication (since there are laws here, but no company policies, for queer people) between the union and the store where they wrote out the schedules for 3 months in her department, which is abnormal, and apparently they couldn't rewrite them. She was a competent worker. She just had some self respect. Yet they almost immediately rehired this man who got fired for threatening a gay man who used to work there. And he is one of the top 10 least competent workers we have ever had. Also. I never plan to work in a grocery store again because unless you are a store manager, or the customer service manager (not any of the lower front end management), you will have to do an insane amount of cleaning that I never have had to do anywhere else in my life.

729,"""RASC""",1.0,- Good Learning Opportunity. - Flex time. - Sometimes they feed you.,"The Kroger RASC (Regional Accounting Service Center) is a good stepping stone if you are interested in accounting or even corporate management but there are definitely A LOT of issues. One issue is: the performance expectation is very high but the pay and realistic time it takes to complete the assigned task is not even remotely equal. You will literally get the minimum salary to do what Accountants get paid great salaries to do. Another issue is the work environment. Management , HR or even corporate for that matter don't care about the environment of their employees and its obvious. They have many issues pertaining to improper treatment based on race, gender, educational background and etc. that have been brought to leadership that have not and will not be addressed or resolved. I assume the resolution to fix these issues is more expensive than sweeping it under the rug and paying out unemployment. The environment is very sit down and shut up. Especially if your of a certain demographic. Training is definitely not a strong suit so dont except much. The veteran employees(not many left) dont release the knowledge in fear of being replaced by younger employees. They are no training manuals, curriculum structure or training teams that assist with ensuring you know how to do your job. If you get lucky you will land in the right department at the right time so you can get some form of training otherwise good luck. This is also on the Leadership side. Managers dont get trained on how to properly deal with issues, employment treatment and etc. To an extent they do as they please. Sometimes HR steps in but most of the time they dont. Bottom line: There are a lot of issues that are not being handled properly and its evident considering RASC is now a revolving door. Kroger really needs to upgrade and change before they are out of a workforce and that is across the company not just RASC. Its really sad that a Multi billion dollar company has such as disgraceful environment. If can survive and thrive here I believe you can anywhere but I wouldn't advise staying long unless you want to lose your mind. I am really scratching the surface in this review.",Kroger

Hours: Full-time employees cam expect to get 40 hours per week but the same cannot be said for part-timers. They usually have their hours cut and can be given as little as 8 hours per week (which equates to about an $80 pay, before taxes and union dues). Since so many hours would be cut, my store would often be very shorthandded and make people help out in different departments as well as do work in their own. 2. Customers: Kroger is one of many companies to go by “the customer is always right” motto. This means they will always favor their customers over the employees and will never give their employees any opportunity to defend themselves if a conflict arises. They also make employees go to ridiculous lengths to satisfy customers, I have seen entire checkout lanes opened specifically for ONE customer over one ridiculous issue. 3. Training: I spent the majority of my training completing tests on a computer and had probably 3 hours of hands on training. Cashiers may receive a full day’s worth of training (8 hours) and that’s it. They will immediately make you work long hours and do tasks you’re not accustomed to. Within a month of starting, I was already working midnight shifts and being the closing bagger despite having said I could not work extremely late hours. 4. Management: The management are very rude and incompetent who do not appreciate any amount of work performed. Instead they look for ways to mistreat employees and make them feel guilty over not doing enough work. Often times they do not usually communicate directly to employees- they do so through supervisors and written performance reviews, which are nothing more than witch hunts designed to snitch on those who aren’t “behaving” right. Instead of rewarding those who show hard work in dedication, they instead force your to do low and humiliating jobs and may even force you to do the work of other employees. They also provide no room for advancement, and more advanced positions often have even WORSE treatment than the position that you would have just left. As for the supervisors and department heads, they have no care whatsoever for employee needs. I have often had my two 15 minute breaks be an hour overdue and would have to take lunches on a full 8 hour day, despite the fact that I am an adult and am not required to take a lunch. 5. Pay: I wouldn’t be surprised if Kroger has the lowest wages of any of the major retail chains. For the first two years I worked at Kroger I made a “whopping” $8.50 an hour. It was only when enough complaints forced the union to hold a voting poll that resulted in all positions be raised to a $10 and hour starting wage. And even this is still below the starting wages of competing stores such as Walmart and Dorothy Lane Market. I have talked to employees who have worked there for 20 plus years who have maxed out at $15 an hour and don’t make much more than new hires in the same position do.",Kroger

The few good managers are bullied by corporate to transfer or quit. Kroger management are often bullied by corporate weekly and invent their own problems while taking out on associates. Corporate threatens to fire all management for the dumbest reasons. You give management and corporate EXACTLY what they want, but they will turn around and find something else to blame you for. My store has changed store management three times in the span of three years while yearly recycling co-managers for no reason. I would say that corporate is the biggest problem with this company. They don't care about their associates or management, but insist on inventing their own problems and starting unnecessary drama. Corporate loves to walk the stores, point, complain, threaten to fire people, and leave. That's all they do. In the meantime associate's hours are cut, benefits are reduced, healthcare gets worse, more work is piled up, and favoritism determines whether or not you have job security. Management and supervisors want you to give your 110% and they don't even want to lift a finger. It's also nice to know that Kroger still has not increased their minimum wage despite their competitors already doing so. Kroger would rather lose associates to their competitors than increase minimum wage. Kroger is making the same mistakes as Kmart and will soon end up like Albertsons. Kroger is a sinking ship, and corporate are too arrogant to realize this. They don't go by what's best for the associates and customers, but rather by what the chart says. In conclusion, I've met a few awesome associates and co-managers that no longer work for Kroger. They all seem to have the same complaints.

As a high school student when I worked this job (I was a senior and I am now graduated and in college with a better job that doesn't involve customers splashing chicken juice on me), the managers really didn't respect that I was a student trying to succeed in order to graduate. They'd call me during school hours, on my off days, and threatened me and my other young fellow employees with the idea that if Kroger was busy enough, they could force us to stay an extra hour past hour shift. One day I called off to do a makeup test, and they wanted me to come in after I was done and work my shift which was 6 hours. I got done at 6pm with my test, and needless to say I didn't go in to work to midnight. I didn't go in at all. They also got angry with me on days when I was sick and didn't even go to school and they wanted me to come in to work. Even when I had pink eye, the managers didn't care. I could've infected customers, as I was a cashier who handled food and money and had to be in direct contact with people. It also made them look really bad, because I was quite obviously miserable and diseased. Not to mention the harassment from assistant customer service managers.

There are so many departments that you can work in, so no matter what your passion is you should be able to find a place where you fit. Overall the environment in the Cost Management department is generally relaxed, with a majority of your job being “hurry up and wait”. Working as an analyst for Kroger will expose you to a lot of very important analytical tools so you are able to build your resume. Along with the analytical skill set, you also build very good relationships with the category managers, which opens a lot of doors in the future.","Working as an analyst for Kroger’s Cost Management department is a bit underwhelming. The first few categories you get to work on are exciting and you learn a lot. After that, you realize that each process is the exact same, just with a different set of numbers, which can become monotonous. The pay is well below the market, and leadership has refused to improve that. Year over year the department, as well as the company, calls that out on the annual associate survey. Leadership has acknowledged several times that they have heard the message, but then make it clear that it will not change. When you are hired, you must agree to stay within your department for 2 years before going anywhere else within the company (or Kroger-owned companies like 84.51). When you get promoted, that 2 year commitment starts over. Being that there are so many exciting areas to explore within Kroger, it’s incredibly limiting to wait for 2 years before being able to move your career in the direction you want. This forces a lot of people to take a look at other companies, and one of the main reasons for such a high turnover rate.",Kroger

Many people I’ve spoken to only stay because of that so if Kroger ever tries to get rid of that, they’re gonna lose A LOT of employees. - I had a lot of awesome co-workers that I would try to assist and they would do the same for me. - You can grow with the company and climb the ladder, if you kiss their tail every step of the way, but that’s up to you if it’s worth it or not.","- The pay is horrible. For everything they ask you to do, how you have to bust your butt day in and day out to get all your duties done and how little help you have, it’s completely unacceptable. - I was paid Part-Time, but I literally worked Full-Time hours so it didn’t feel very fair after awhile. I didn’t feel valued despite my work ethic and trying to ensure all my duties were completed. - Corporate has a tendency of making employees lives’ more stressful than than they need to be because when you can barely do everything they ask you to do because you’re short on people, they pile even more on top of you. - Our equipment was always breaking. It could’ve been the Slicers, the Scales, Fryers, Rotisserie ovens, the hose nozzle, Dish Washer, you name it, and it takes management what feels like a millennia to get anything fixed, unless it’s something we NEED like the Fryer or Rotisserie Oven. Hell it took them roughly a year to fix our dish washer, no joke. Not only that but when they did the remodel they didn’t even bother giving us a new one. They just don’t care about their employees or making things easier on us at all and it shows. - Every day when I came into work, there was always some new conflict. Either someone quit, equipment broke, departments took what was left of our supplies, an employee left my work area a mess when I came in, some of my co-workers were not held accountable for their actions or to the same standard as some of us, we got a new Manager that wasn’t worth their salt, etc. I could go on and on but you get the idea. - This store’s Stockroom area is a NIGHTMARE. Nobody ever organizes it and it’s always such a disaster, that it’s difficult just to take out trash because there’s no room to walk. Honestly they should be ashamed of themselves, because the way they manage this store is just pathetic. - The job itself is really easy, pretty much anyone can do it, but it is a completely stressful environment. You wake up every day and may not even want to get up because this place completely drags you down and saps away all your energy or motivation. Just not worth it, least not long term.",Kroger

The district manager in my region thinks by saying over and over again how they will not tolerate something, or constantly tells us how they will protect the district staff will make us do a better job is baffling. Why even have coordinators? They have done NOTHING to help my store. They are seen by us long time managers as a sounding board for the incompetence of the district manager.

The problem with this is that we are ALREADY so overburdened with tasks that we already cant complete. Turnover is pathetic, and our Co-Managers are running for the doors.

Quit trying to impress District by saying everything is wonderful, and then on break talk about how horrible things are. We are already working 60 to 70 hours a week, so if you REALLY want to feed the human spirit, realize who is dealing with your guests, THANK US for working hard, and for God's sake, give us the opportunity to actually RUN our stores.

Smaller signature stores can sometimes be shorthanded, depends on season and how much money the store makes annually Don't expect overtime, some nice managers will allow some people to stay over, but expect them to be telling you to leave when your 8 hrs hit Front end can be a hassle, if you work a stocking job be prepared to be called to the front if they're shorthanded (not all day of course)",Kroger

Now I’m not one of those people to say saving money is a bad thing but seriously, it’s bad. Firstly they cut a lot of things to save money that a lot of customers love and it ruins their experience. They even cut the 2 dollar off coupons from the uplift cards(employee motivators) and that was the only thing I liked about them. Secondly, they purposely schedule you to work work work. I mean this as in they give you wonky hours. If you see you work 5 hours and 45 minutes that’s because the greedy bastards want to work you that entire time and only give you one break although you basically did 2 breaks worth of work. The same goes for lunches. I use to have entire weeks of 6 hours and 45 minutes days. Lastly, no overtime. Ever. This leads to a big mess because sometimes the workload can be too much and you have a few things left unfinished. Tomorrow is bad because a truck comes in. Too bad. Any chance to give you 30 minutes of time and a half is too much for their hearts to take. The pay is awful. At the end of this month I’ll finally be with the company for two years and I’ll also finally start making 8 dollars an hour.

Don’t get me wrong I don’t hava problem with special needs people, I have relatives who are special needs, but some of these people honestly don’t deserve their job. The entire store is a table and the workers are the legs to support the table. If we have people who can’t support the table you have an issue, and it may not be every store but it’s definitely an issue here, but hey, Union... Lastly, seniority. A good and a bad. Seniority shouldn’t be the absolute factor in hours. I may sound like a jerk but hear me out. One of our baggers is a really good cleaner and the cleaners get the early 7:45-4:15 shifts. But she will no longer be the cleaner because another bagger, our special needs bagger who’s been here since ‘97 has her mother complaining about how her daughter isn’t the cleaner.

It all depends on the store, but these cons are consistent throughout most of the stores I've worked in. You have to also be mindful that Kroger will look through social media to find something that suggests you are negligent. The management can be quite unprofessional, too. Depending on the store, management will find a reason to fire or cut hours for its employees, and there is no point in working for a company that cuts your hours when you are already paid minimum wage.

I can only speak to the Michigan division but this company is a total joke. I worked for Kroger for a little over 3 years and in that time I have seen the company do a complete 180 when it comes to its treatment of its management staff and to an extent, its district staff. Divisional leadership does not care about management at store level period. They are more focused on making sure the hourly associates are being taken care and being retained and don't care about stepping on store management to make sure that happens. The average Co-Manager training group will lose half of its employees in the first year and might have 3 or 4 left after year 2 (mind you these classes start at around 12-20 people). If your planning on having a family just forget it, its not happening. You will be guaranteed 50 hours a week and the only weekends your getting off are the ones you use vacation/personal days for. Every holiday you will be working 6 days, even if its a holiday that you only see a 10% increase in sales like mothers day or fathers day, it does not matter, as a Co you will be working 6 days for those weeks. Yes it is true, they will promote hourly associates to positions above you. Most of the district teams are becoming that way, and Divisional managements response to that is ""well you should want to be a store manager"". That's fine most Co's do but, there were only 13 out of about 400 Co managers that were promoted to store management in 2017 and a few of those were district leaders that were given stores for the first time. If you're coming from college good luck, if you want your own store and don't want to be a Co-manager, not gonna happen until you're at least 30 so if your 22 out of college that's 8 years before you get a promotion. Basically if your coming from college the 50k or whatever they're paying you now is not worth it unless you want no life for the next decade all for a 3% yearly raise until you finally get youre own store. Like I'm very serious if your in college reading this, take the 45k at whatever the hell other job your looking at, you will waste years of your life here buying into their false promises just to realize years later that you've wasted most of your 20s. Oh yeah, and then there's the union, which basically makes it impossible to fire the terrible associates which makes the good ones pissed off and either quit or slowly breakdown into and average to bad worker.

The biggest problem is that the department is understaffed. I have probably worked more shifts with overtime than shifts where I get off around the time I was scheduled to. Every time I close I worked at least half an hour of overtime, if not an hour. It’s a new store, so I try to be flexible and understanding, but at some point, I feel that I’m being overworked and my time isn’t being respected. Along those same lines, it’s very rare that I am able to take my two fifteen minute breaks and my thirty-minute lunch. This is a problem for my co-workers as well. Since the department is so severely understaffed it’s not uncommon that one person is running the deli and one person is doing hot foods. This is a problem because if either person goes on break there’s one person doing work best suited for about four or five people.

Kroger monopolizes everything and I feel that ends up having too many hands in the pot and things are just unorganized from the get go. I don't even know where to start! From day one, the co-manager didn't know our group was going to be in the store until the night before. We were given to a lady that manages a particular dept in the store. After our store walk, we were given a shirt and told to go work in our departments--with no training and literally no one there to help me. There were 2 guys supposed to be there with me, but yet they were nowhere to be found the hour I was on the floor. I had multiple questions about a few products and no one was there to aid me--LUCKILY I had the experience I have so when I went into the back, I knew what type of boxes I was looking for. I was also not informed of the A's and C's. So I can't even tell you how many of each there are!! I've been in the grocery business for quite some time but I've never experienced the level of unprofessionalism and disorganization since high school and flipping burgers! Granted, it's a grocery store but I expect to be treated and talked to with more respect--I am a grown adult, who sadly applied for the position in order to take care of my family. Which leads to my next point.. With my experience, I was expecting a much higher rate of pay than what they started me out with. I was disgusted. But I had no choice--I had no income. While in training, we discovered a union rep would have to be contacted because of one lady's rate of pay. I was given a one day notice about my training so I wasn't going to be able to cancel previously made appointments. I was told it would last 4 hours which would give me plenty of time before my appointment. But our facilitator was unprofessional. Too many personal stories and personal phone calls during our time. What was supposed to be 4 hours turned into 5-7. I left after 5. My availability was also not respected and put into the system whenever I went onto my schedule--I have a family and am a grown adult, I am not able to have open availability. Luckily I found another job and washed my hands of this. Exhausting even before the get go.",Kroger

Should I apply for Smith's 385 everything looks good in the beginning until heaven fell to hell faster than Space X.,"assistant district managers are the best con artist ever. But sometimes its just they are too evil for their fangs, horns and tails not to come out. If you would let me explain how bad it is i can explain it in details but here at the employees review website looks like their protecting the reputation of these evil or maybe just scared to just get sued. Well I'm not!! Because there's far more disgusting stuff I know about this store even deeper. I completed premed classes and graduated MA with straight A's with leadership experience and awards on hand. I seriously do not deserve the way they treat their employees. Seriously If you'll ask other employees they would just cover up and its totally different when another employee is facing them.. WHY?? Because they are scared to lose their Job. I am a researcher, an observant with analytical thinking, I can read peoples actions and I know if you are on your way to sabotage. I am not anxious about other employers who will take a peak and judge the way how I describe things. like I said this company is lucky that I didn't file a complaint against them because if I wanted to I will so it anytime. Because they treated me like crap and so as other employees. I have to stand up for these poor people. Another thing if I tell you the dark side of how things work specially the management .. except my manager and he district manager is very nice and polite. But the assisntant district managers..Please! Send them to recollection they need to see the importance of their employees and the impact of how they treat their employees to the company and the customers.. Benefits won't cover their dirty business. I've have experienced working at retail before. Back in L.A comparing my experience to this retail store and they way how they treat their employee, which I am sure that I didn't sign for this from the beginning with its minimum pay of $8.25/hour, which is the lowest ever received ever in my employment history. Plus my blood pressure went up to 135/80 which I am suppose to have only 119/80 according to the doctor.. this Job could have killed me if I decide to continue on. Hmm what does that mean then something is very wrong. All i know is I've worked so hard for this company to the point where they owe me so much with breaks. Same as others who left. And they weren't treated good as well we talk about it all the time. They keep saying take ur break when really there is no chance. They want us to pass our Job to someone else who's also busy.. while the rest of my co workers bring their gf at the back, chatting, texting hangin' out in the middle of the shift while I throw 4 loads of trash, help 5 customers, sweep and mop the whole entire bakery, and follow the closing rules which is hard to catch up specially when you are on your own even though theres somebody there. And If you can't finish on time then the people in the morning will talk a lot of crap. And make it a big deal complain about it to the manager. When they enjoy their working area and the beginning of the day clean and neat and leave all their crap to the closers. Then they will say that the closers have to easiest duty.. O yeah how about we switch I'll talk crap and you sweep your whole entire body to the whole entire bakery just like how I did plus the stress Assistant manager brings. Alright very Unprofessional.. It isn't retail. Its HELL. No one listens. No justice. They act like humans but wild animals at the same time.

(Despite decorating most of the cakes, my pay was much, much lower than the head decorator). • Higher management is out of touch and has no idea how to run the food-based departments. • Union basically makes it impossible to fire you unless you're stealing. This means Kroger is full of employees doing the bare minimum, or are completely inept, including alcoholics, and can't fire them. • If you're an honest worker, the union is a scam. They practically corner you and make you join and it's $8 a week you're paying, basically just to get a little pin for your name tag. • ALWAYS understaffed. Expect 1 bagger for every 3 cashiers. • If you work in a food service department, hours are nonexistent for part-timers unless it's a holiday. There were many weeks I got 10 hours or less. • Unless you work in bakery, deli, Starbucks, or meat, you will have to help bagging or cashiering on the front end multiple times a day",Kroger

I didn't think that I'd have any initial problems working at their grocery store, but they are incredibly mean and do not value their employees in the slightest. I am a full time college student, but working there was the absolute worst part of my week. We only get small breaks (not actually lunch breaks). Management is rude, not only to its employees, but I've had other employees complain to me about how incredibly rude management is to THEM. Kroger is incredibly unorganized, and it doesn't help working in the front end. There are lots of small details that front end service clerks should not have to worry about, yet management makes it their problems when it shouldn't be (like cashiers scanning produce - it is inconvenient to scan produce if you already know the PLU like the back of your hand.) I would never recommend anyone to work there, ESPECIALLY if you're disabled. Publix is far superior in that sense, they are known to treat their employees very well, and they are lots of benefits to work for Publix, too. They ACTUALLY get 30 - 1 hour lunch breaks, and Publix is not obsessed with cashiers being incredibly fast scanners to the point where it is hard to keep up. Stock is also available to employees who work for a year, I think. A lot of former Kroger employees are realizing how terrible Kroger is and moving to Publix... myself included. I like that Publix treats their employees like actual people. I absolutely hate Kroger. Never going back!",Kroger

They all knew it was my first job, I was bound to get some things wrong. But my managers would just see me doing some small thing and immediately report it. And then they wouldn't say anything about it to me and would just wait until I got called into the office for it. Their training is joke. During your two week training period, you would spend an hour of each shift learning on a computer program that usually consisted of a dozen slides of generic information, sometimes a five minutes video, and a short quiz at the end. Then they would pair you up with another worker and expect that you already know how to do everything. While it might sound like a solid plan, the reality is that computer training can only do so much, you need hands on experience. And the people you get paired up with are just regular workers, they have no experience training someone and with the store always being so busy they don't have the time to show you how to do things and still get their own job done at the same time.",Kroger

It's fun to see yourself grow as a person, but it comes with a heavy burden..","I was working 16 hours a week, part-time. Or at least I was supposed to be. I was not set out to be a cashier in the first place, so I admit this review is half-hearted. But hear me out...The training was highly drawn out, and the videos shown for training are completely overrated and scripted (but of course they're supposed to be). They show you a utopia of customers and co-workers. Not even my first day on the floor, I was met with hostility and animosity, not only from customers but from the people I was set to work with! (which adds more to the reason I wanted to leave aside from moving away from the area). I've seen the bad reviews about Kroger, and going into it, you don't want to believe it. HEED MY WORDS: BELIEVE IT! Everything about the work environment is toxic and the managers are NOT associate friendly. Even though you're told to ask for help when needed, the help comes with a very negative attitude because THEY DON'T WANT TO HELP YOU!!!!! If you're willing to give up your social life, then this job is definitely for you. It seems that's the only way to make any real money in their stores. And yes, Kroger has a lot of benefits, but at what cost? You don't even get a bathroom break unless it's an emergency, and even if it is an emergency, you have to get cleared by a manager or floor supervisor just for them to tell you that you got 5 minutes. I'm not heavy on the bladder, but 5 minutes isn't even enough to squat over the toilet..let alone wipe your arse, wash your hands and get back to your register. I've seen a lot of my friends working at Kroger, and I've seen the stress they've been under since then. Degrees and accomidies don't matter in a place of work like this. All in all, I'd rather sweep a sidewalk for the rest of my life than work at Kroger or any of their brand stores. I've only worked for a day and It was the worst day of my work life. And I'm only 19. I called in to let someone of high management know I couldn't make it due to moving from the area and that I was looking to quit, but he rushed me off the phone before the words ""I quit"" could even escape my mouth. I'm not even sure if I need to take my uniform up there or not. That's just how fast he clicked me off. All seriousness, do NOT, and I mean DO NOT, waste your time with Kroger. The training is a little too much, hours are terrible, and the pay isn't compensated by the time and effort put in. Not to mention the management is dingleberries (look that up, it's gross). You're better off somewhere else, trust me. This is coming from someone who has nothing, but a will to make money and make a name for herself. You can do it!

My first week working at the new Kroger I get a phone call at my old kroger asking where am I? I said I was working at the new Kroger and they said ""But, we need you to come in...""

Not to mention that there have been times where some of us have had to work shifts starting at 6 AM following a shift that ended at 11 PM immediately after. 4.

My friend tells me the health benefits are the best in his family, but I personally believe that life insurance is a scam and I know it is included in the plan.

They will take a part of your income and won't even tell you. They are leechoing $8 a week from me and I can't get out. Their representative sets himself up as a workplace lawyer, but in reality, if you do what your supposed to, you won't ever need a lawyer. The wages might seem low, but the work is so menial, repetitive, and easy that if it were any higher, it would be an insult to people who actually earn a higher pay. The worst parts of my job are the stats and numbers. When you focus on serving the customer and think of their shopping experience, the work goes a lot smoother and you tend to like people more, but as those numbers start to brainwash you, you'll be more focused on your ring tender (allotted time per transaction according to number of items) and items per minute. This takes the priority away from the customers and more on yourself, which means when a customer isn't cooperating, is slow, creates problems, or makes a mistake and your numbers go down, you will develop bitterness and will start to get annoyed at the slightest things.

Management is very apathetic towards employees, they want results, and don't care if your department is understaffed. The OSAT score that they push employees to strive for is an inherently broken system and promotes an unhealthy work environment. The willingness to work around your schedule for a college student is completely dependent on your department manager, you may or may not have a bad experience with that. No store consistency.

Compensation is terrible for new hires. Minimum wage minus one hour a week for union dues. Most of this I actually blame on the long-term associates themselves when they rate how they want the union to negotiate contracts (long timers vote to raise their pay while the new hires don't bother because they'll only be there for a year at most) but it further adds to the recruiting and burnout problem. Everything is focused on reaching the overall satisfaction score, even though you can only get that rating when a customer gives you a perfect five. That's all fine except for the many customers who rate a 4 and say ""I'm never highly satisfied"" or ""I just came in to pick up some milk, nothing special."" Que the self flagellation.

Corporate is an absolute joke, and is constantly coming up with new ""Plans"" on a weekly basis. They do nothing but stress the entire store out. Management has to strongly abide, which ends up stressing out and making everyone angry. Once you move up in the company, you become a puppet to management and corporate. Management typically doesn't care about you (Some managers are good, but most aren't) all they care about is getting their job done that corporate pressures them with. Corporate seems to only care about money and sales, and every employee is just a body to them that they can replace in a heartbeat. If you like recognition, don't work here because you will get it very seldom. It's hilarious that this company toots their horn about ""Customer First"" but then treats the employees like trash which results in poor Customer Service. If you want your company to succeed, you need to work with and make your employees happy. I've worked with this company for 6 years and corporate has been the same since the get go, and is slowly getting worse. Managers are hit or miss. I've came across a few that have been really good, but most of them are so heavily pressured by corporate that they end up being a disaster to be around. If you need a job for some extra money, overall this place isn't too bad at a lower leel.

Also, most of the management is awesome. I only have one who I'm not super fond of. The rest of them are super encouraging and fun to be around.","They treat me like garbage!! I've worked here for almost 4 months now. I got hardly any training and am still unsure about a lot of things about my job. I had to learn 99% of the stuff I know on my own, and when I do something wrong I get my butt chewed for not knowing it. My lead switched one girl to the front end because ""she wasn't cutting it"" and then went to everyone in the department and told them why she switched her and how she's imature and all this other bull. A week later she comes to me and threatens to send me to the front end if I don't start to learn more. I told her I didn't have any training and that I'm trying my best and just got a huge lecture about it. I and others have told her that I do a lot more than most people and she just said that they didn't train under her so she can't do anything about it. One girl literally sits on her phone her whole shift! It's all about favoritism at Kroger. If you're not the favorite then good luck. They also cut hours like crazy! I live on my own and pay all my own bills. I make $8.50 an hour and get about 24 hours a week. They make it impossible to get a second job with the way they schedule me and my lead even told me she doesn't have to work around the schedule of another job. I've begged and begged and even threatened to leave if I didn't get more hours so finally I got bumped up to almost 29 but it's the holidays so idk how long that will last. Most of the employees are miserable because we're taken for granted. We work our butts off for them and get little to no recognition. The seniority policy is dumb too. I can't get more hours than someone who has seniority unless they request less hours. Someone with seniority gets all these perks and because I'm the second to the bottom of new people it is constantly thrown in my face. One woman I work with has seniority under the lead. She tries to act like our lead and tell us what to do. She literally never does her job. She's never in the department, and the only time i ever see her doing work is when we have truck. Even then she complains about it. We haven't had truck in a week(which is really bad) and whenever we get a call and it could possibly be truck she throws a hissy fit. But because she has seniority she doesn't get in trouble. She talks to us like dogs and cusses at us all the time. If we go to our lead about it we're told we're starting drama.

You will NOT be thanked or given any recognition, in fact the slackers will probably get more praise than you will; b) If there is conflict between U and another employee, you'll both be given a little talk and told to just get back to work.

The cashiers are all friendly (and as a courtesy clerk you really have to like them no matter what.) Some of the baggers are annoying but that's probably just because they're fed up with the job. The management is okay depending on who you're dealing with and when you're dealing with them. They're humans.,"Teens: do you enjoy being underpaid? Do you enjoy being overworked? If you answered yes to both questions, then Kroger is the place for you. The management will happily get away with paying you the FEDERAL minimum wage (7.25) and then paying employees that are 18+ years old $8.50 an hour! That's right! An 18 year old who does the same things you do will get paid a dollar-twenty-five more. But wait, there's more! They're not even remotely flexible with schedules and get annoyed whenever you ask for a change. Are you in school? Do you have homework? Too bad, looks like you're going to be working 'till 10 on weeknights. Just a few weeks ago, they made me work 4 weeknights in a row until 10, when I should be getting homework done. They don't care.

I tried to get things figured out so I could go back to school and still work but apparently to work in pretty much any department you have to have no time restraints. Shifts are chosen in order of seniority, so if you're just starting out, expect to close in just about any department until people above you leave and you start getting new people. Also pay is really sketchy.

It was fend for yourself. If you had questions, the managers would get upset or get all huffy and puffy about how I was supposed to know something, therefore I usually would ask the register in front or back of me interrupting them. Managers made me feel stupid, alone and won't answer legit questions. If I didn't fix something right away, the problem wouldn't be resolved. Managers are never around and customer service is always swamped. Just they way things go is how things go around here. Co-workers are cliquey. SO UNDERSTAFFED. Rude customers. I can understand why. They overwork you at a low pay. Don't give out enough hours or if they decide hey let's call her in, they won't bother clocking you in. The department and manager communication is so spread out. Expect to never have plans. You never know if you're working on Sundays because of the weekly schedule. They assume things without asking you of you feel comfortable doing them.

Kroger is very much rooted in the store experience and often times places your store experience higher than outside Kroger experience, such as education or other company work. We are expected/pushed to do more with less bodies as we seek to reduce overhead, yet the stakes just get higher and higher for earnings goals- pushing your more talented to the brink, while not holding under performers to higher expectations. It's a joke in Kroger you essentially can't get fired from Kroger. We continue to see strong performers leave because they can't take it anymore.

Also I had a problem with my seniority. They scheduled me for every holiday for the six months I worked there, when I questioned why people who worked there for a shorter period of time as me was getting them off and I had to work them, management told me it was because they had seniority over me due to more hours worked.

Either way, I was paid I guess.","I worked during break & lunch hours while being punched off the clock during over night hours and was asked to by management because they refused to hire two overnight employees. I worked during break & lunch hours while being punched off the clock during over night hours and was asked to by management because they refused to hire two overnight employees. Kroger's union is a joke.. the people who were employed through the union for Kroger were obviously bullied into the corrupt politics at play behind this corporation. I worked overnights and days for them for 7 months and had to help customers while being punched off the clock for a break and a lunch when I worked nights.. because no one else was hired to work the cash registers with me when I worked overnight.. Then Kroger had a problem with a ""coupon lady"" who would come at night time and get hundreds of dollars worth of goods for practically $20 some bucks by the end.. I mean she was getting away with coupons that covered 4 cart loads of stuff. When I would ring her up at the end, I would call my supervisor just to make sure that what I was doing was ""technically legal"" and if I was allowed to over-ride it with the manager card that was given to me. You know what my manager told me? Yes. What I was doing was legal and that it was okay to ring her up and over ride it with my manager card. I was the only one that could check her out because she came when I was by myself and it was a time of day that was vulnerable to the store. I had to validate her coupons while many other shoppers needed my help finding things for them or needed my assistance at the self checkout.. this created many instances in which customers could have stolen stuff from the store because I couldn't be in 10 different places at once. I was later ""asked to resign"" because they thought I was ""helping"" this woman get away with the crap she was trying to pull.. The lady gave me some of her stuff afterwards when I was asked by her, to help her take some of the carts out to her car.. take note we had no baggers, no workers stocking shelves and no other front end employees on staff there at that hour. I was alone with the lady or man who was buffing the entire store floor that night. The doors didn't lock on one side to keep me safe and I'm a female, anything could've happened to me. The store could've been robbed and I could've died on site and no one would've been there to call 911 to save my life. There was no dotted line in which I had to sign that said I couldn't accept gifts from strangers or shoppers during the hours I was off the clock while on break or on lunch but was required to work or even if I was on the clock and working there was no law against it. Their evidence to hold up against me would've been superstitious at best.. no one was around to give another statement otherwise and even if they were the they would agree with me that I was not the dirty person. My business ethics are gold. I could've gotten away with a law suit however, I didn't know this at the time. They have no legal proof from anyone saying that I was helping this woman to steal from the company I worked for. Video proof would show I checked her out like every customer and helped her to her car like normal. Suspicious activity creates doubt in a court case and that provides you with time to form a case. I had a better future elsewhere and went ahead and left. I've now finished 4 years of college and would never work for Krogers corporate office. No matter how much they'd pay me. When they asked to resign I had a person of the corporate union there with me but I wasn't even allowed to take the paperwork with me to have my father's corporate lawyer, John Brewster look it over before I made up my mind on quitting vs resigning. I was forced into making a decision right then in there at the store and that alone should be made illegal on all levels. By the way, the coupon lady ended up telling me that she bought her coupons from places like ebay and told me there was a loophole that allowed for her to legally get away with all of the merchandise she did.. as long as she bought a few of the items listed on the coupons then the rest of the coupons would work for other things. They scanned and I did my job the best I could. Yet I was punished for doing my job the best I could. The lady was banned from the store like she should've been, but Kroger never asked once for my story they just assumed I was dirty and let me go. Guess what Kroger. I wasn't and I'm not afraid to air my dirty laundry to have your union and corporation searched for corrupt behavior. I was the only one doing the job of 4 or 5 people.

Most people do not stick around because they can easily find jobs that pay more at companies that aren't as mismanaged. Other than that, there is nothing positive that I have seen.","Poor pay of $7.45 an hour, which is insulting, especially considering this is a ""union"" job. Both the union and the company have failed their employees if the negotiated wage is $7.45/hr, which is 20 cents over the federal minimum wage. And over 60% of my weekly pay goes back to the store in my grocery purchase. This is a prime example of corporate greed - they pay you minimum wage, then give you an ""employee discount"" of 10% on only store brand items, to entice you to spend your check right back at the store. Managers do nothing for a lot of money, and treat you like garbage. For $7.45/hr, they should be making our lives as simple as possible by providing excellent leadership and organization. The are not. One example - the floor manager (who is my direct supervisor) tells me to do one job. Literally two minutes later, the store manger (management) tells me to do something different without consulting with the store manager first to see what my assignment was. Then someone visiting the store from corporate (for some unexplained reason - nobody knew why she was even there) tells me to do a completely different thing five minutes later. The customer service manager is someone who has been there forever and is very good at their job. This person was undermined by managers who had no knowledge of the needs of the front end, but yet insisted on trying to ""be the boss"" and go over this person's head. The person from corporate also insisted on making customers go to the self-scan lanes, even when they didn't want to. Some people (me included) do not like going through the self-scan lanes because you have one person running 4-8 lanes, so instead of one on one interaction, so you risk waiting behind 7 other people for help. But she insisted on forcing people to go there, then dumping them onto the self-scan employees, resulting in the customers being hostile to the employees because they were upset that they were forced to go to self-scan against their will. A prime example of corporate blindly following ""company policy"" without assessing the wishes of the customer in front of them. If people don't want to do something, don't force them to do it just because corporate says you have to - people are all different, there is no one size fits all approach to customer service, you have to deal with the situation in front of you using common sense, and you can't legislate that via rules handed down from the top. Also, the employees are all in high school, since nobody will stay there for more than one or two months if they actually have to pay their own way in life, since you can't do that on $7.45/hr. This makes the customer service manager's job impossible, since they never have a consistent staff - how can you staff a store when you have such high turnover? Then management yells at the customer service manager when staffing isn't sufficient. Who's fault is it that employees won't stay? The management that pays them minimum wage when other stores in the area pay much more, or the customer service manager, who has no say in hiring, no say in wages, and is stuck with whatever happens to come their way?",Kroger

It protects you from unfair treatment which can occasionally happen, but it also makes it very difficult to get rid of bad workers.

There's also a member's only credit union which, while I have yet to explore into, I have been told they have unbeatable low interest rates. -Union benefits: Kroger is a union job. Being in the meat and seafood department, I work in a different union from the rest of the store, and am granted access to better healthcare options than most everyone else in the store. Kroger itself doesn't do a necessarily good job of highlighting all those benefits, but it is definitely worth looking into if you plan on staying for more than a summer. Speaking of which... -Cumulative perks over time: If you wish to only work at Kroger over the summer in between school seasons, you're certainly at power to do so. However, the longer you work, the more benefits you will accumulate. Life insurance, pension, paid time off... All of these will increase the longer you keep at it.","-Work/Life balance: Since working at Kroger, my social life has pretty much vaporized. I have not seen any of my friends in over a year and find it difficult to make time for family. I've put education on hold while establishing myself here, and am not sure when the work will let up enough to let me continue school. (Management has a habit of blowing every situation up into a crisis and whipping their workers into frenzies.) My everyday life has pretty much become a repetition of working, going home, and waiting to go back to work. (while recovering from the stresses of the previous work day.) To be fair however, much of this may come down to me working in the evenings. -Ramping expectations: When I began work, they didn't expect much of me as far as efficacy or knowledge. But in less than a year, They have come to expect and outright demand me to be able to competently and expeditiously work the entire meat and seafood department (which includes lunch meat and frozen meats.), clean and close the department, and take care of dozens of customers every hour. (many of whom are either clueless and expect to be spoon fed and waited on hand and foot, or bullies who attempt to run roughshod over me in order to get a deal on their meat.) Also, since two new people have been hired on since I began working, and (my) Kroger works on a seniority hierarchy, I am no longer considered by management as a new guy, and am scrutinized for each and every mistake I make as I also attempt to teach and lead the newer hires. (I have worked there for less than a year.) As of this review, the only things I am not expected to do are ordering product or cutting meat. Which is ironic, as I took this job on because I wanted to learn how to cut meat. -Unreasonably small work teams: This is easily the biggest grievance I have with Kroger. If you look up Kroger in the news, you will see articles praising the company for their ability to undercut their competition on prices while keeping an increased variety of product selection. They often ask how they manage to do it. The answer is simple: They keep their stores understaffed and cut hours whenever they can. I have worked with employees from multiple stores, and they all pretty much work the same way: two workers a shift, two shifts a day. If we're lucky, we may get a fifth worker to work in between shifts. This is how we're scheduled every week. No more than four workers at a time to fill up the service case, work out lunch meat, work frozen meat and seafood, fill up the meat case and bunkers, cut all the meat for the day, order product, review backstock, break down the trucks, mark down all product that is short dated for quick sale, scan out all outdated product from inventory, close and clean the cutting room and service area, face up the all product to keep the shelves looking full and consistent... And that's not including taking phone calls and care of customers, who can (and have) waylay you into anchoring you at the service case for an extended period of time, while more customers come and empty out the wall you've been attempting to work on getting filled all day long. And then management comes over and berate you for letting your department get so run down.",Kroger

I now work in the software industry but it took me a year to find that job and during that time Kroger was there. They kind of suck and kind of exploit their employees but still, they were there.","1. Pay. It is very little and not nearly enough to live on. I think I got one or two ten-cent raises in the year and three months that I worked there. (Despite a small promotion.) 2. Hours. The start times for my shifts were (usually) either 5am, midnight, or 2pm. Getting a regular sleep schedule was difficult to impossible (though some employees had more regular schedules). This also made it harder for me to look for better employment as I was often sleep-deprived and physically tired. I spoke to management several times about how it was difficult for me to work 2pm-10pm and then come in the next day at 5am. No one cared. Nothing changed. 3. The work. In addition to the physical labor, I was also put into a quasi-managerial type role of delegating tasks within my department and often writing the daily orders (which takes more thought than you might think). I felt that the new responsibilities ought to command a higher pay (maybe just a dollar more-- which would've bumped my pay to a whopping $8.70 per hour)-- but alas, that did not happen. 4. A toxic environment. My store had daily meetings (called huddles) where our manager would call us out individually on anything negative that might have been done. Those meetings absolutely destroyed morale. There was rarely recognition for a job well done. A common expression was that you might do nineteen things right and one thing wrong and that one thing is all you will hear about. At first, I always tried to go above and beyond but eventually I realized that doing a good job versus doing the minimum yielded the same results. No one is perfect and therefore mistakes will happen. If all that will be focused on will be the negative then doing great work doesn't matter. So I stopped caring. (By the way, I care about my job now and it feels great to care about your work. It's been a new experience for me.) 5. Middle-Management. They were mainly concerned with pleasing the higher ups and had no regard for those below. To be fair, the store managers have an extremely difficult and stressful job. The higher ups in corporate seemed to come up with these demands and expect the store manager to work some miracle to make them happen. Certainly a hard job to do when they aren't allowed to pay for more and better workers. 6. Work-load.

Apparently, the time I served as a bagger was ineligible for a raise (thanks, Union). After that, the union only allowed five cent raises per year, for part-time associates. The union also protected the ""lazy"" workers. In any given shift, there may be 15 people ""working"". Two or three will be doing ALL of the work, while the others played around.

A few of my supervisors are great friends that legitimately care about me and my well being. They know me well and trust me. If a customer comes up saying that I was rude to them or something like that, they know that I wasn't because I'm not like that. At least at my store, you work when you want. If I don't feel like working on Tuesday, I can make sure I'm not on the schedule Tuesday. As a cashier, you learn what is a good deal and how to save money.","The whole attitude of the company is bad. Kroger values each customer so much that they will let them get away with anything. Want to return your 2 year old toaster with no receipt? No problem. Want your tomatoes free because the first one you picked up was bad? No problem. Want a sale price for a different variety of an item because you couldn't read the sign? No problem. This means that we have quite a few stuck up customers. Customers throw a fit any time they don't get exactly what they want, even if you are following company policy and even if you can show them the policy. What is worse, if they ask for a manager, the manager will come down and in front of you, apologize that the employee doesn't understand the policy, give them what they want, and promise that they will train the employee. The pay is also bad. Most people will start around minimum wage and get a raise of about 20 cents a year. The way Kroger works promotes being lazy. You know that bagger who has been here for 3 years? Yeah, the guy that refuses to push carts in, puts milk on top of eggs, makes a bigger mess every time he tries to clean up a mess, and who we need to hide every time corporate decides to come by (which happens around once a month and would make you think the president is here) because he always causes problems? Well he gets paid more than me, who has about 10x more responsibilities than him and gets chewed out because when I was supervising, the lines were too long (even though we were using every single register, had more baggers than registers, and had just about the entire store at the front. The people that Kroger hires are amazing, and not in a good way. I feel more like a baby sitter than a supervisor. I can't believe I've had to say things like ""don't ask a woman if she is pregnant"", ""don't pick your nose and then grab someone's bananas"", ""you can't put bleach in the same bag as meat"", or ""you can't pet service dogs when they are working"" to adults. These people also never seem to get fired. One kid has been written up 50 times in the past few months and is still here. Algorithms run Kroger. How many hours should we schedule? Check the computer (hint: not enough). How many registers should we have open? Check the computer. How well did we do in serving customers? Check the computer. How well did we do at keeping things in stock? Check the computer. It's insulting that they don't think that we can make basic decisions. All of these metrics also work independently of each other, so if you follow one, you are likely going to get dinged in another. No one in the world can manage to keep lines short while still providing an experience that is ""highly satisfactory"" while keeping enough lanes open (by calling people who stock stuff up) while keeping stuff in stock while using a very low number of employees. Kroger is probably an economists dream, but in practice it doesn't work.",Kroger

Recruiting/ Human Resources wasn't related to my major, but Kroger seemed like a fine company to start with and possibly advance or move laterally with in the future. We had five weeks of paid training which entailed go carting, laser tag, and group activities. Pretty solid benefits as others have stated. Really big cubes with dual monitors and the leadership team seemed legitimately concerned with your well being. Pay was OK at 16 bucks an hour for what the job actually had us doing. I had diverse and just plain great people as coworkers which made coming to work tolerable.","The training was fun, but for the most part had little to do with what the actual job was about. The four generations classes, color code assessment, and group activities we did were meant with good intentions, but were frankly a big distraction that literally consumed close to 2/3 of that five week period. It didn't help me personally learn my role well enough and I know a lot of others felt the same way too. That was really disappointing to me because Kroger is such a huge company so I expected it to be more tailored with less fluff. When it came time for us to sit down and learn the computer functions they'd just stuff 3 or 4 of us admins into a cube with another already full time admin and have us watch them which wasn't effective because we were just holding them up from doing their jobs so they wizzed through everything to get us out of their hair. It affected my performance because I wasn't totally prepared when my division live. When Id ask my supervisor a question or for help he'd just stare right though me like it was the first time he saw the sun, just in awe because of what a total idiot he thought I was. My division and some others had supervisors with zero patience. I became terrified when I came into work every day in fear of making a mistake because of how critical he was when I literally had just started my job. This snowballed to my detriment. I was a good employee just going through some growing pains and performed adequately once I got grounded in my work, but I think I was written off from the start and really wasn't given a chance to be successful here. I was eventually terminated, but I had already been looking for other jobs about a month into this and was planning to quit once I found something else. For the most part this is a mindless desk job. The admins don't even get to interact with candidates which was something I was told we would be doing from the interview and had looked forward to. The work is extremely repetitive and dry. You're glued to a computer for eight hours a day doing grunt work for the recruiters where you're paid less than them, have more responsibility, and have nebulous performance metrics where only your mistakes are scrutinized and are never praised on the good work you do. After a few months of working there I began to notice a faint nagging pain in my right wrist from all the clicking and moving the endless waves of candidates to new app. I started to feel like Peter from office space towards the end. If you're like myself and just pounced on the first opportunity to come along I would advise you to wait for something you really want to do if you have that luxury. It was a paycheck. People were already dropping left and right so I'm curious to see how core will be doing in another 6 months. Misery loves company right.",Kroger

I wouldn't recommend this as a first job, especially if you are in a lot of school activities. You are expected to ask your manager if you can go home when it is your scheduled time to get off-- if you do not ask, you are often ridiculed in front of people, talked down to, or told to go back to your register until they get a moment to take you off. Sometimes you are thrown into other departments with no say in the matter-- you do some jobs in that department regardless if you know exactly what you're doing.

It focuses strongly on customer satisfaction, which keeps irritable customers to a minimum, while maintaining a friendly atmosphere within the store.","On the downside, you often find a lack of quality in the training you receive. You're basically instructed to just get out on the floor and start working. For cashiers, this is super unhelpful when you're learning to run a register. You may end up being paired to learn with someone who is only focused on quick checkout to maintain a ring tender, rather than teaching the procedure of certain parts of the checkout such as keying in produce, printing checks, ringing up large or speciality items, or receiving payment in more than one method. This also trickles down to the bagging. Even though common sense should dictate what goes in a bag and what doesn't, you'll commonly find first day baggers throwing items in bags without any order. Customer Service Representatives and Floor Supervisors also receive negligent training. After one or two days, you're basically left to cope on your own. This is an issue simply because of the overwhelming amount of aspects included in the job. While working at the service desk, you have to remember several PLU's for just one of the many services, including money transfers, refunds, exchanges, coupons, etc. Without a guide to reflect back on, you may find yourself stranded early on. The pay is also very poor, with $0.20 raises every 6 months, unless you're a bagger, in which case you won't receive a raise at all. Unless you have had at least a year of previous experience in retail, you begin at minimum wage, which is odd for a large company like Kroger to do.",Kroger

If you work with slackers, they will fight their way out of write-ups and the like to not get fired. Very little work/life balance. I made the mistake of saying that my availability is open so that I can get as many hours as possible (within reason). In my department, we're understaffed and no one cares to get more applicants in or to give enough hours to share, so you'll have 2 people from 4pm until close, trying to clean up the department, all while having to cook, tend to customers, AND in some cases, cut bread for bakery (since they're also understaffed and usually have one in the department). It would be easy if we had even one extra body, but 2, considering that the shift before closing never cleans up after themselves is a task. What ends up happening is they won't have enough help in the day, so they'll ask someone else to come in on their day off (in some cases, they only had one day off to begin with), or things don't get done and the closers get reamed for it the next day. It's a minimum wage job, so if you're front end, or in a department that's not particularly demanding (which is usually only front end), it's just way too much to do, not enough time to do it, and definitely not enough pay.

For a multi-billion dollar company, you'd think they would invest in their associates, the people who keep the company alive. Rather they invest in what? Key retailing practices that are a waste of time, weekly manager meetings that are more or less a waste of time, and all of the other nonsense that they think will improve OSATs.","This use to be a great job, but the past few years the company as a whole has taken a very negative turn. Key Retailing, that's just an excuse to ask for more work from employees and not give them any more time to do it. The budgeted hours situation? Seriously. I'd love to hear someone from corporate explain why exactly a store is doing more business than it was doing two years ago and on half the manpower. How can a department run on 18 hours of man power when the store is open for 19? And management expects ten times out of employees now than they did two years ago because of how much corporate is pushing down on them. HAS ANYONE IN CORPORATE EVER WORKING IN A DAMN STORE? Because to me, (and maybe with my masters degree in business I'm just stupid) it only makes sense that to run a company you must understand the basics of how the business works. That means the day to day operations in your stores. That means understanding that only having one person in a department during prime-time hours is counter productive. Not to mention that its harder than hell to accomplish anything in your department because you're running register. And why are you running register? Because its the first of the month and budgeted hours were so low that there are only two scheduled cashiers. THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE! Please, continue to work your employees until they snap and quit, like so many have. Stop viewing your associates as a disposable means to an end.

Kroger strives to maintain a good reputation for customer service and quality products, earning customer loyalty to generate more profits. While the starting pay isn't always great for hourly employees, benefits are affordable and perks include employee discounts with cell phone providers, 10% discount on Kroger-owned brands (Private Selection, Simple Truth, etc.), and discounts for amusement parks and zoos on certain days.","At the store level, it can be hard to move up in some departments. If you're willing to switch to a different department or even transfer to another store, chances for advancement improve. Hourly wages generally depend on whatever the union has already negotiated for you, so unless you have related work experience at the time you're hired, it can take a while to make much more than minimum wage.",Kroger

Otherwise, none.","* If you look on the list of reviews here in Glassdoor you will see that more than half of the reviews made by ""co managers"" have 2 stars or less. What does that tell you? ** Co-manager has the highest turnover percent in the entire Kroger Co. It is above 50%. And there's good reason(s) why. I did their training program called MD1 a few years back, and let me tell you something. It is absolute rubbish! I'll tell you everything you should know about Kroger's management program, how it works, the truth behind doors, and why you should steer clear. *Be careful what you tell people. Not everyone who smiles at you is your friend. Gossip is all over Kroger. On your first day, you will be lucky if the store manager is even aware of your new employment as a trainee at their store.. Other co managers of that store will know nothing about it. Who you are, why you're there, what to do...nothing. The store manager is supposed to be your ""mentor manager"", but don't expect him/her to have anything prepared for you that week working with him side by side. They will not want to make time for your questions. The so called ""core values"" you hear about redundantly are never disclosed or discussed with the associates. The farthest they may go is to departmental heads. And do you even think the deli clerks, cashiers, produce clerks etc. would even care about that considering how little they're paid? A few weeks into the program you will go to the regional office of your districts where you will sit for 10 hours a day listening to Kroger's plans of wishful thinking on how they're going perfect the business. They're goal is to have customer satisfaction levels for all stores to be a whopping 80% by sometime in 2015. Impossible. Most stores are lucky if they can hit 70%. Some are even below 60%. It's a fantasy world of perfection at the office. When you return to your store, you'll have around 100-150 papers to organize and plan out all on your own how you're going to complete your tasks.The store manager will know nothing about what you just learned at the divisional office and what your assignments are. Oh and they talk about surpassing Wal-Mart soon. Sure, Wal-Mart's net revenue for 2013 was over $16 billion. Kroger's was $1.5. Kroger is in the Top 10 Lowest paying companies in America. Right there next to Wal-Mart. You will get constructive criticism always, not compliments. You may have done something correct, but when it's reviewed by management they will look for the negatives in it. You will have nearly 100 online lessons and you can't jump to the quiz at the end. Your base pay will be $40k, but there is an overwhelming amount of stress and work to get it. You will always work 6 days a week and overtime which means nothing when you're salaried, Don't count on holidays either. There is extreme favoritism and prejudice in Kroger. If your manager doesn't like you for any reason, he will find a way with minutia to get rid of you. I was once written up for taking my tie off in a bakery assignment. Promotion within the company is very limited. Kissing butt in upper management is how it's done. So, like I've said above Kroger sucks.

Praise is very scarce and little rules are often nitpicked (or encouraged to be by upper management). If you start as a courtesy clerk (bagger/cart boy) you have to beg for cashier, which would be fine if it functioned as a promotion but it sadly doesn't. After you're given cashier you get the next paygrade up in the union handbook (very likely ten cents). They can also make you a dual bagger/cashier. If you make supervisor you also get no raise. Vacation benefits and holiday pay are nonexistent until a significant amount of time at the company (over a year). Management is also abused and disconnected from their associates.

8068,"""Terrible Company to work for.""",1.0,"First, in reading through many of the reviews here, it sounds like most come from union stores. Let it be noted that I work in a non-union Kroger store. It has many of the problems described from union stores. I believe there is absolutely no difference whether the union is there or not. You have just as much job security in a non union store. If you show up and don't steal, you won't be fired. One of my favorite things about the job is interacting with customers. I love to fix problems, make them feel comfortable and valued, and address their issues by giving them knowledgeable solutions. If I can make someone's day better and less frustrating, it's a win for us both! Promotions- There is room for promotion if you show competency in your work, loyalty to company, have a good work ethic and good attendance record. Perks- 10 percent employee discount on Kroger brand items. Cashiers get a few ""fun size"" candy bars when they make elms scores. Occasionally free food/party days in break room. (This is for day shift. If you work nights, all the food is left out to go bad by the time you get there. So nothing for night crew.) Occasionally, free sandwiches from the deli can be found in the break room refrigerator when they become outdated. Last year, my store got a tv and new couch in the break room. I think this was supposed to be a perk. Personally, I do not take my breaks in the break room. It is dirty and it smells by the time the night crew comes in. Benefits- Insurance (I feel cost is high, I pay almost $400 a month for myself and 3 children) 401K, After being employed a year, you will get 1 week paid vacation for part time (28 hours) And 2 weeks paid vacation for full time(40 hours each), 2 personal days a year. You must work 8 years to get 3 weeks paid vacation. 15 years for 4 weeks and 25 years for 5 weeks.","Where do I start? Training. This consists of several days taking computer tests. Then on the job training is supposed to be several days of working with an experienced employee in the department you were hired into. However, this time is usually used by making you bag groceries instead of learning the job you were hired for. Work Load. The amount of work you are required to do within your shift is so unreasonable and unrealistic that most of the employees I work with are disgruntled and have feelings of hopelessness. It is a terrible thing when your job makes you want to give up on life. You have to cut breaks as short as possible, or work through them. This is actually encouraged by management, but is supposed to be kept hush hush so corporate doesn't find out. I think the highest stress part of the job is not being allowed to go home for the day when you are scheduled to. You must stay until your work is finished, regardless of how long it takes you. I have often been forced to work 10 to 12 hour days, 6 to 7 days a week. You never get 2 consecutive days off. I had asked for 2 days off in a row and by some miracle, it was granted to me. But, then as a punishment for taking 2 days off, I was forced to work the next 9 days straight before I got another day off. Their reasoning was that if you get 2 days off in a row then you should be so well rested you don't need days off for a very long time afterward. Holidays. I have worked every 4th of July, Easter, Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas for the last 4 years. When asking for these holidays off, you are told that nobody gets them off. Everyone has to work the holidays, as if this makes it perfectly ok. No consideration is given for anyone with families. To Kroger, stocking cat litter on the shelf is much more important than being with your family on a holiday. Management will often take the attitude that if they have to work it, so do you. The work-life balance is non existent. I have brought up this issue with management over and over and it has fallen on deaf ears. It is impossible to make any kind of plans outside of work because of the inconsistent scheduling. Stress Level and Management. You would not think that working in a grocery store would be such a high level of stress, but you are constantly condescended, disrespected, nitpicked, and in general, treated as though you are an incompetent failure. The true incompetent failures are those that run the Kroger company. They base everything on numbers and not realities of what's actually going on, on the floor. They do not care about the employees as far as I have seen. Some management, (not all) will cuss you out for certain infractions. It has not happened to me personally, but I have seen it. Nor do those in corporate care about their store managers. They criticize to the point that the managers have no choice but to hand it down to the employees. Employees are not treated as individuals but bodies who can be forced to do more work in less time. The turn over rate is high because of extremely low wages, terrible training, insane work load, and the condescending attitudes of many in management positions. If you bother to stand up for yourself, you will be told that you have an attitude problem, are not a team player and you are not doing your job. There is zero communication at Kroger, unless it is to tell you that you did something wrong. Nitpicking is rampant by some members of management and tattle-telling is rampant by many co-workers. It is a difficult environment for mature, educated adults to work in. There is very little praise and a lot of criticism. Kroger is constantly coming up with new programs to make things better in their stores. All they do is make a complete mess. Kroger best practices are many times so time consuming that your 8 hour shift would turn into a 16 hour one if you followed them. You have no choice but to cut corners. My son asked me once if he could work at Kroger when he was old enough and I gasped and said NO! The mere thought of my child working in such an environment makes me shudder. I would not recommend this job to anyone. Go elsewhere if you are just starting out. Don't make the same mistake I did or you will be stuck in a hopeless and thankless job, just like me.",Kroger
8069,"""Met some great people but was overworked.""",2.0,I made a lot of friends working there. Your co-workers and employees generally are very pleasant to work with. They do have very good benefits. Good insurance even to part-timers. Spend a lot of time training you upon entry to your position as Co-manager. I did move up from a part-time clerk to co-manager.,"They tell you in interviews you have 45 hr work weeks. I never worked less than 50 on a good week. I sometimes worked 60 hr weeks. You are paid salary so that additional time does not equal additional pay. Many store managers do not care about their employees and mistreats them, this didn't include the upper management as you didn't see them on a regular basis and when you did they were actually very kind. The store manager sets your schedule and usually sets the schedule to their benefit and no one elses. It's very difficult to get time off but this all goes back to bad store managers. I only ever worked under one store manager I liked. No real training after initial training. Store manager does not spend time teaching you, as the upper management states they are suppose to do. I spent a lot of time vouching for my employees and was often ignored and reprimanded for caring and following contract. Store managers tend to favor bad employees and abuse the good employees. I have heard store managers scream and cuss out employees around other managers and no one cared. I tried contacting HR about the managers treating the employees this way and was either ignored or told that's just how he/she is.

Associates are treated poorly. They have unrealistic expectations. Favoritism is a HUGE issue. It is like everyone working for Kroger never grew out of high school....even management. Department heads are not given the freedom to discipline their people. My manager wanted to write someone up for something (it was last year right before the holidays) and one of the co-managers said no ""we wouldn't want to hurt their feelings before the holidays"" people slack off (they still get the raises anyway, why work for them!) and nothing is done to fix it.

Although when both my bosses are having a bad day they take it out on everyone. And some times their bad days were related to things happening at home. And it would bring unnecessary drama., but once again that could potentially happen at any job. Also they kept wanting us to make a ton of sandwiches, stock the case and do tons of other things that wouldn't fit in an 8 hour shift. And we have to take care of the customers too. And we were really under staff so it was near impossible to do all those tasks. And in my opinion the customer should always come first no matter what. But If we didn't get the task done they would be down our throats in no time at all. And also both my bosses would talk trash about everyone in our department which was messed up and created more drama. And with their gossip it caused a huge turnover rate. Because the news would travel around the department and people would quit once they heard what they truly thought of them. But that's not Kroger's fault. It really depends on who your bosses are. I finally ended up quitting because the job became to stressful and it became too much of my life. It was becoming too much like high school with all the drama.

So if you haven't noticed yet there is a trend going on so let me spell it out for you ;) The managers doesn't care about how hard you work or if you call in for every sick day your allowed as long as you show up enough to keep your job and dress in your work attire during open hours. All Kroger requires of you is your presence, nothing more nothing less. Don't bother working hard like I did, just do the bare minimum and you'll be fine. So what if one of the employees calls off for a sick day regularly, you can do the same as long as you stay within your allotted allowance per year. Who cares if somebody stocks twice as fast as you, as long as you reach your quota that's all that matters. Pick up smoking as a habit as well, screw it. Take your 5+ breaks compared to the regular employees 2. Also, while the others are thinking of ways to make he job easier or doing extra just sit back and relax because your not paid to innovate, your paid to be a drone that does what is needed... nothing more nothing less. As for job growth tips, if your a female you can get a ""raise"" from your boss for an actual raise if he is unattractive so that's a good idea, if your a male just show up perfectly clean-cut and be a YES-man and you might have similar luck, the workload you pull doesn't help or hinder your chances so that's irrelevant.",Kroger

People who are lazy and unmotivated will love this job because the union, while it protects good people from being mistreated, also makes it very difficult to discipline or remove poor employees. There is very little room for advancement. Job positions that you would expect to lead to a raise do not (such as service desk attendant or floor supervisor). It seems what advancement does happen is random and is not based on seniority or performance. This makes good employees lose hope and either quit trying or quit the job. Also, baggers will never get a raise unless they have been trained in a different position. Fuel center workers are not eligible for any benefits or full time.

Lots of different technologies (albeit outdated) supporting many different areas of business, so there is a lot for an entry-level person to learn. You might have the opportunity to bounce to another team every couple years if you're looking to learn something new. It's a great place if you want to settle down, quit learning, and just ride out a job for the rest of your career. The employee discount is nice. I'd imagine this is a decent place to be a contractor at. No overtime depending on your contracting firm. Likely working on developing new applications. The option to buy vacation time is really nice. They give a lot to charity.","Management loves process and paperwork, having a process for everything. Management senses an issue with a project? Let's add in some process and paperwork. Need a 5 minute chat with someone from another team in IT? Just spend 15 min and fill out this form requesting their time. Needless to say, Kroger IT is in no way agile except for maybe 5% of their projects. However, every team will claim they're agile because they hold 45 min stand-ups every morning. Terrible work-life balance. Management tends to over-promise to make themselves look good, often without listening to your feedback. This means forced overtime. Overtime that is in _addition_ to 24x7x365 support overtime; even if you're on a ""rotation"" you could be expected to be available at all times. Most (not all) people are just riding out their careers (to be fair, likely burnt out due to the overtime, processes, and paperwork). They're done learning, done innovating, done caring, and, due to this, generally aren't great to work with if you have a dependency on them. You'd think managers would help in this area considering it's their job. They won't. They expect you to continue nagging the other teams' managers if you have a dependency on them. Due to this, a majority of a developer's job can end up being nagging other teams to get things done. Managers reinforce this by basing your merit increases and promotions on this ability instead of technical ability, which is reflected in the quality of the applications. You'll see many (not all) higher level developers without a lick of technical competency. This is how. Kroger has lost many good developers over the past few years because of this. Pay. Even after reading the above, the job might be worth it if you were paid a premium. Unfortunately the opposite is true.

If all tasks aren't done, they are basically told that they are just crappy workers and need to ""step it up."" Associates are told that they have the opportunity to move up but when someone comes along that turns out to be a big brown noser, or sells marijuana to a manager, they get promoted faster. Favoritism and sexism is a huge problem at the store where I work. You can do your job, and exceed expectations, and go beyond what is asked of you, but you wont move up if your not the favorite. If your a female its even worse. If your a female trying to move up, your treated like your stupid, told that you dont know what your talking about, and in some cases management will even tell others that your just a dumb ""hoe"" that doesnt know their job. The store does not care about its employees safety. When pallets of water come in, averaging over 2000 pounds, they have to be pushed through the store on a hand operated hydraulic pallet jack. When you move them to the front you have to drag them across some carpet that nearly doubles the resistance on the jack. We used to be able to use power equipment to move the water much more easily across the store, but because a couple of workers scratched up the floor a couple of times, you now have to get 2 people to move heavy loads. Its going to be interesting when workers start filing claims of injury over long periods of time because they refuse to at least allow the employees to use the power equipment on things like water, or pallets of 3000 pound ice. We have many avid drug users in our store, and apparently nothing can be done about it. According to management, the only way an associate can be drug tested after passing the initial drug test during hiring, is for them to be involved in a power equipment accident. I know of at least 6 people in our store that have come to work drunk on alcohol, stoned on marijuana, or high on methamphetamine. I have reported it in each instance but was told each time, ""there is nothing we can do unless they have an accident."" Different people are held to different standards. Certain people who come in and abuse the system are allowed to do whatever they want. However, when someone who consistently shows up on time, puts in a full days hard work, gets overloaded and cannot finish a massive truck, they are berated with derogatory comments about how they are horrible workers.

The store I work at has nice managers, and nearly all of the employees know each other well enough to have small conversations. It is a small store, so this is not unexpected. Theme weeks and holiday apparel are nices treats to the employees. These make the otherwise complete monotony of the job a little less boring. The employees receive discounts on phone contracts with a few major carriers, but these discounts are not available to employees who choose to use pay-as-you-go carriers, like T-Mobile, Virgin Mobile, and several other options. These pay-as-you-go carriers are preferred for their sane policies and reasonable prices, and their ""no surprises"" billing.","The job is very tedious and boring. Dealing with a new person every 2 minutes is incredibly disorienting, and it desensitizes you to people's feelings. The job is not depression friendly. It is not ADHD friendly, nor is it autistic friendly. The job is not intellectually stimulating in the slightest. If you require intellectual stimulation to feel normal, this job will leave you feeling sick, and you will have lost some IQ points while on the job. I've also done some mental math on the monetary versus mental reward for the job. I do this job part-time, and I do not live on my own, but if I did it full time and lived on my own, this job would pay barely enough to live, eat, and get medical coverage (if that), at the expense of making me permanently stressed out and unable to sleep at night. Additionally, your quality of life will be extremely low, because food options are limited with such little money, a phone contract is expensive, but required for modern life, and vehicle and housing options are both limited and of low quality, so you can expect frequent maintenance and emergency repairs, which cut into your budget even more. Lastly, the ""buy now, pay later"" scam for everything in the good old USA means that you will spend upwards of 200% on any major payment in your life, such as your house, vehicle, and insurances. Yep, that's Capitalism, always looking out for the working class. What would we ever do without it? The employee discounts on Kroger products is laughable, when compared to benefits at some other grocery stores, namely Whole Foods. Kroger's employees get a 10% discount on any Kroger-branded products in the store. Whole Foods's employees get higher base pay rate, and they get 20% discounts on everything in the store. This does raise the questions of ""whose base prices are higher, in the store?"" and ""whose discounted prices are higher?"" but, after considering how much better the product quality is at Whole Foods, an additional question is ""which store offers better quality of life to its employees as a whole?""

This is great for the relative few on that level but may not be so great for anyone else within the company","As objectively as possible, where do I begin.... -When you hired as a store-level manager (or above) by Kroger, stay goodbye to your personal life. Literally. Co-managers work an average of 50 hours per week with most of those hours occurring on nights, weekends and holidays. The work schedule varies from day to day and week to week so there is no set schedule. As a store manager, your life is structured around Kroger. There is no work/life balance whatsoever because Kroger will become your life. You literally belong to them. -The compensation is fairly weak. As a new co-manger, you'll probably start out at 40K (or slightly more or less depending on experience). Not horrible...if you were working a common 40-45 hr, Mon.-Fri job that payed overtime. But since you are not and you are on call to work anytime Kroger needs you to, this wage is quite unfair. -There's opportunities to ""grow"" within the company. However, a promotion is not easily attainable. There's a lot of personal politics involved with moving up the Kroger ladder. And because of the relatively poor nature of the job, most exit the company before they even have the chance--and experience-- to advance. -This is not a job--or company-- for a college-educated person with tangible skills. Most store managers are under educated workaholics with very little integrity who stuck around because they had no where to go (except another grocery chain, maybe). As a new, college-educated co-manager, this sort of individual will most likely be your boss. Your co-workers will mostly be just as uneducated and generally unskilled. Put two and two together and you have a workplace atmosphere that's filled with ignorance and not-so-sudden jealousy and intimidation. -Speaking of work atmosphere, be prepared to be in a daily cross between The Jerry Springer Show, Honey Boo Boo and a bad high school soap opera. Professionalism, on any level, is nonexistent. The place is rife with non-stop gossip, fraternizing, drama, petty competition and just overall negative vibes. With the exception of the baggers in the front end (mostly bored high school kids and/or equally bored retirees), for everyone else, Kroger is their life because ...well, they're always there. Literally. -As a co-manager, you are essentially a glorified stocker and babysitter. This is not stimulating, professional work for a business-minded professional. It's menial and low-rank labor work. You'll soon see that you're not running a business organization. You are a cog in the machine that makes sure everything runs smoothly on a low level so that the suits on top can make even more money. -No accountability whatsoever. As pointed out in the Pros section, it's VERY hard to get terminated or laid off from this company. That's a pro for anyone who wants to keep a steady paycheck coming. It's a con for the hard workers who have to deal with (and in my particular case) work over the many lazy, unmotivated associates--and managers--down on the store level. These lazy individuals are the way they are simply because they know they won't face any real consequences for their actions. Unless they upset someone higher than them on a personal level, which is of course, very professional. -Despite giving away your life to slave away in a grocery store, except to be quite unappreciated. Upper management (district manager, department coordinators, etc.) will nit pick everything you do without much constructive criticism. Nothing anyone does is good enough. It's also important to remember that most of the department coordinators used to be in-store employees there's a lot of politics and favoritism there as well. For what its worth, I've seen dept. managers literally curse out and physically intimidate the store employees (including managers) who they disliked and have off-the-job lunches and parties (and sometimes, romances) with the ones they ""liked"". As noted above, there are no professional boundaries whatsoever in this company. -Integrity and honesty are two of the company's corporate values BUT there are rarely practiced. There's very little of both with this company. All in all, I would NOT suggest Kroger to anyone UNLESS you are beyond desperate for a salary and benefits. Yet, even then, it's a waste since neither Kroger's salary and benefits package is sub par compared to other, more lucrative companies. It is most definitely not a job for anyone who is educated or skilled. There is a reason why the co-manager position, in particular, has such a high (over 60% last time, I checked) turnover.",Kroger

Nothing really a big deal about that except that if you're slow they'll take you off due to the whole ""Faster checkout"" that Kroger is promoting. A lot of times you'll work 6 hours and 45 minutes so you're only allowed a 15 minute break (at least this is how it's like at my location). If you work 7 hours you get a 30 minute break. 8 hours is the max, you can't do overtime. 30 minute break at 8 hours too. Cashiers start at minimum wage ($7.25 here in Texas) with a $.10 raise every 6 months. The max you can make as a cashier is $12.15/h I'm told by some that have been here for 20+ years. (Extra information) Supervisors are pretty much the exact same. Never hired as a supervisor. Only promoted from being a cashier. Promotion is a $.10 raise to do the same job but work customer service and ""watch the floor"". Meaning, not too many people can be in one line at a time otherwise you get a ""dip"" due to Que Vision saying that there was too many people waiting in line for too long. Nothing you can really control if people won't move to another line when you tell them that you can check them out and they refuse to because they don't want to move. Then supervisors get in trouble. Due to Que Vision people from other departments have to be cross-trained to work a cash register. Example: People in grocery/dairy will have to come up to the registers when called, making it difficult to complete their job. If you fail Que Vision and get too many dips or a bad percentage, district will come out to the store and find out the issue.",Kroger

Each day, I went in lost, Job details were not expressed, 2nd week I found store room. Daily job rotation sheet was posted, found it on day 6, One visiting Pharmacist commented, she didn’t understand how they were training me. She asked the senior Tech who was training me, or if the Senior Tech was to. Senior Tech stated “I’m just to answer His questions” “Ready Fill” computer program is nice, once you have experience with it. However, limited training was provided. In HR, while reviewing computer program, two were used for training. Tandem, terrible program, was used for part of the training, than their new “Ready Fill” program was shown. Training just showed “fixed” copy of pull down windows, no interaction for trainee. They have a manual for trainees to the Dept. However, none were available for me. Assistant Manager stated “it was Human Resources responsibility to supply it.” I was in Management for over 20 years, when new hires arrived; I made sure all training materials were ready. Job goals for new hirers were not explained. I was told I was too slow in counting out prescriptions. I said “than, you don’t want me to double count” (Senior Tech the day before, scolded me for not doing this) except for controlled prescriptions, which are always doubled counted. Assistant Manager replied, no don’t double count anymore.” From my work station viewing the drive up window was hard to see, she said I needed to respond to the window faster. Next to last day when I worked there, Floater Pharmacist requested me to fill an order with 6 RX’s in it. Although it was not next in line to fill. I was about half way finished. Senior tech, saw what I was doing, and jumped me, because I was filling out of schedule, the RX above this had turned Yellow and needed filled. Senior Tech snooty said, I was taking too long. I have friends who work at other Kroger’s Pharmacy, they love it. Their training was done while working with another employee for a week. Assistant Manager was talking with HR, stated she needed more techs, and however didn’t want any “School” trained. That I wasn’t working out. I was so sorry I ever took the job with Kroger’s At Lewis Center; they need help setting up a training schedule. When I told the assistant manager, that day, would be my last, she smiled.

That being said, forget about any kind of personal/family activities. The work/life balance that they talk so much about is practically non-existent. Extremely long hours. On average, 50-55 on a good week and 60-70+ when all hell break loose and the latter will happen more often than you think. Scheduling is really random, it's nothing like I was expected when I was getting into this business and right now, it's not working for me at all and I can't imagine it working for anybody else. - Salary/Wage is supposedly based on a 45 hour work week. Here's the thing, you never work 45 hours. The week you do, I seriously hoped you enjoyed it because it might not happen again. Also, the pay is not competitive, it is nowhere near enough considering the amount of stuff and crap you have to deal and put up with. People working for you are probably and most likely getting paid more than you. Granted, their experience and specific skills play a big part in that but it gets seriously ridiculous when even the backup or lead make more than you, sometimes a lot more. - Nothing you do is never enough. Under appreciated and sometimes forgotten. You will however, be remembered as soon as something goes wrong. If you think that nothing went wrong and everything is fine, then don't expect too much praise because once you hear ""but"" you better brace yourself to hear how bad you've messed up somewhere else and how many more ""opportunities"" you've got to fix. - If you do want to make a career at Kroger starting as a Co-Manager, your first store assignment can make or break you. On that note, some stores are on a level of their own when it comes to the customers that frequent the store and/or employees who work the store. It can be an overwhelming challenge to the point where you'll be affected physically, mentally and emotionally. I have seen some of the happiest, pleasant, nice, always smiling people break down in tears and becoming the complete opposite of themselves just because they have to go to work at certain stores. - A lot of changes in the company, things can change overnight, and higher ups can come back the next morning to check to see if that change has been implemented. Sometimes, they come up with some unrealistic goals, without even taking into account the location of the stores. (Different store, different market and different competition). - The UNION can make it really difficult to deal with certain employees, especially the bad apples who think they can do whatever the hell they want and get away with it, and sometimes sadly, they do. - Not much glamour for a ""management"" position ""I'm a manager at Kroger"" just doesn't mean anything. Most feedback you'll get from people is probably ""Oh yeah!!....OK"" and that's about it. - Getting promoted is not as easy as they made it sound during training. After a while, you will start to feel like you are stuck with no real chance or opportunities to move up, at least not until you get to take one of those level-up classes that only come around once every blue moon, or you suck up to the right people. - Lastly, dealing with some arrogant, selfish, ungrateful and disrespectful customers who feel like they are entitled and want to get anything and everything for free just because Kroger is a fortune 500 company",Kroger

Words cannot describe how incompetent the managers at my store were. Kroger is still in the dark ages. They would constantly put themselves on the pedestal and told us to support the Kroger company (ie: don't shop elsewhere) since they were the only ones with ""decent wages and benefits"". All the while, I knew quite well that even walmart hired workers in at a higher wage than I made after four years as a good employee and two promotions. After 7 years, I still hadn't received a single benefit and had received raises amounting to less than the increase in federal minimum wage. I was supervising the entire sales floor for 8.90, a whopping 1.50 over minimum wage. No benefits, and union dues for a union that allowed a company to pay so little, provide no benefits and keep employees ""part time"" at 38 hours a week almost indefinitely. It was a union that did in fact mean a lot to full timers, but to part time employees, full time seemed to be offered after a decade of service, and from what I saw, it was given to a few employees when a manager was transferred to another store or was leaving the company.

Frankly, many of them are. By that, I mean that many of the employees really don't care in the least and will do the absolute minimum amount of work required of them. This is likely due to the poor wages offered by Kroger. You WILL start at minimum wage if you have no retail grocery experience. Additionally, you will NOT receive any raises under the current bargaining agreement until you have been employed for at least 2 years. This is very frustrating to the 20% of employees that actually put forth quality effort while the other 80% slack off. If upper management gave store level management more power over raises, this would do tons for the company.

Hours for part time positions are currently very low. And despite not having enough hours to go around, they are still hiring new employees. Major chances just started occurring with special security hired to keep an eye on employees. Rules are becoming absurd, and fear is high.",Kroger

Overall, the people you work with and (most) customers make the job tolerable.","I did not like that they give you your schedule for the following week on Thursday, and there was no consistency on how many hours you'd get or what days you'd have off. So it made it quite impossible to make plans with family and friends, schedule appointments, etc. unless you requested a day off, and even then you couldn't guarantee that you'd actually get it off. Pay is horrible. Like someone else said, if they were allowed to pay you less than minimum wage they would. Department heads slack off and go around to other department heads chatting all day while the lower employees work their butts off to cover all the work. Store managers and co-managers go around barking orders even when you're the only one covering your department and you have a zillion things already to do. They never like to get their hands dirty and help out. I don't know if this is true with every Kroger (I'm sure there are the exceptions) but it was a very well known fact that that was just how things were there. They strongly discourage you to take a 30 minute lunch break and instead want you to take two15 minute breaks for a 8 hour shift.

Luckily, the terrible ones usually get weeded out over a period of time and I consider this a good point.","As a regular clerk, you are relegated by seniority since they are union. You must work all holidays and most weekends and for most people that is a negative. Raises are not given based on your work ethic or production, they are given on a time line because they are union.
