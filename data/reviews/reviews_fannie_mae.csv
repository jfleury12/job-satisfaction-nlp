I loved my job, pay was great and all FTE's received a bonus. The past 2 years, upper management has made it very clear that they will continue to get a large bonus, while the working class get little to nothing. If you are not a manager or above, a bonus is a thing of the past They are hiring contractors by the truckload as many people are leaving to go to different companies. The brain drain is due to all the items above I noted. Do not expect to get a bonus if you are just a normal FTE. Upper management had protected their bonus structure and for anyone they are protecting. Everyone else will lose thousands. Upper management like to push their product and leave the products that are actually customer with no updates or budget to complete improvements. They only way you will move up in the company is being a yes man to anyone above you. UM states they want to hear different ideas, but if you are not towing the line for their pet project, forget it.

The work is not too strenuous (and this may depend on the group you're with) and the hours are pretty flexible. Your experience may vary based on your manager and whether or not he/she is a good coach/leader.","Plenty of red tape . A lot of bureaucracy. Things don't get done at the pace that you would expect things to get done. Too much control on technology and software in the name of security, which itself becomes a hindrance to progress. Decision makers at the senior levels sometimes purely get there due to seniority and may not make decisions that are always best for the organization/team from a long term perspective. Performance evaluation cycles are a sham and all attempts to make it better fundamentally have only resulted in changes to the software/user experience related to the self-assessment write up, which probably accounts for nothing significant at the end of the day.

To get promoted you have to apply for the higher position in most cases.

The benefits are very good.",Projects can move incredibly slowly due to politics and bureaucracy. You can take on side-projects but don't expect to be rewarded for extra work. Promotions are primarily political rather than merit-based. Egregious pay gaps between people who do the same job and have similar backgrounds are ubiquitous. The bar is very low when it comes to work quality so there is not much reason to put more than the bare minimum of effort in. You will not learn much when it comes to design here.,Fannie Mae

Teammates are composed of relatively young people who are energetic and eager to learn/impress. High emphasis on data analytics methods and constant improvement.","Keeping up with everyone's high level of personal interest is daunting when you personally aren't invested in the content. WoW meetings are often redundant and break the flow of work when placed in the middle of the workday. There is constant pressure for work results, though management is somewhat flexible with adjusting the workload.",Fannie Mae
69,"""Great place to work""",4.0,"The leadership and directors are extremely smart. They are open to new ideas and are consistently working and striving for better. There is a huge emphasis on innovation within the company, and fresh idea/thinking is very valued. Directors are extremely respectful with work life balance. It is appreciated! They also make sure to carve out time to discuss career goals and growth. My interview process was very seamless, as there is a huge interest and recognition in talent acquisition and recruiting.

Contractors have their own seating areas, equipped with smaller desks along the corridors. When employees get new DELL Precision laptops, contractors get used HP. By the way, contractors are prohibited from attending FM's team building activities. This rule is published on FM's website. I can see some employees do not hide their disdain towards contractors.

They break all the rules and nothing happens - Some VP’s abuse benefits. They will spend over $100k traveling and staying at hotels so that they can live the good life at a cheaper city while hard workers have to find ways to afford living in DC - Performance Management tool is a joke. Everybody knows it, everybody complains about it and nothing is done to change it. Managers will sacrifice new employees to give more senior employees a better rating since a bell curve needs to be satisfied. So, you will not get the subpar 3% they “guarantee” even if you meet expectations. Same goes for the “bonus” - I moved offices 3 times in under a year. Signed a year lease and was never told we would be moving prior. I found during orientation - Management thought it would be fair to just give a $1,200 yearly raise to offset moving the office to midtown. That is not enough to cover gas and parking. Most people will need to spend an extra 30 minutes commuting and pay more in rent to live closer. - People are rude in the company as most people in DC - VIP parking (within the same building) was assigned via a “lottery”. Two drawings and “surprisingly” all managers and above got a spot - Serious ethical issues such as directors wanting others to fail to look good or just say “I told you so” - Constant power struggle amongst management - No one works on Fridays; they just keep Jabber active and pretend to be working - No assigned offices. There is a 40% deficit in available seats in the new building. Let’s see how that works out on Mondays through Thursdays - Life balance is non-existent.

Much is said about a human capital plan, which may sound impressive but is essentailly a constant re-evaluation of who could be expendable. Another buzz phrase is shape shifting, which boils down to replacing more senior middle management with lower cost staff. The CIO actually stated that employees should consider a 18 month tenure a good run in the ""current environment"". Below the officer (VP) level the constant churn is discomforting. At the VP level and above the brain drain is on. If stability is important this isn't the place for you. After 9 years of conservetorship parallel business plans are about to collide. The Obama administration planned on winding Fannie down with a plan of bringing the capital position to zero by Jan. 2018. Not only is Fannie still in place, it's delivering billions of dollars to Treasure each year. Those dollars are generated from gaurantee fees collected on qualifying mortgages to cover losses related to loan defaults: essentially insurance. But all of the money collected in fees is transferred quarterly to the US Treasury, so there'll no capital to cover related losses. As a result, Fannie Mae would need to draw from Treasury to cover quarterly losses. This is exacerbated by a lower than 35% Corporate Tax rate. Fannie Mae is still writing off losses, but the writeoffs assumed a 35% tax rate. A rate any lower decreases the value of the write-offs, which increases Fannie's tax liability. With no capital in 2018 there's no money to pay higher taxes.",Fannie Mae

Technical people are doing process/project management work and analysts are performing in technical roles. People are shuffled around the company with no regard to their skill set or even job preference.

My nick name for Fannie Mae is ""Stepford"" after the famous original movie and remake. Everyone walks around there with a fake ""installed"" smile on their face. They will drink the Kool-Aid or they will be gone! I was pulled over by my boss in the hallway for coughing on a conference call. If you have seen the original or remake of the movie ""Stepford Wives"" you will get the idea. My professional IT career stretches 37 years and I've worked for many different organizations during that time. Never have I worked for an organization more concerned about the slightest “real” emotion emoted. No expressed frustration allowed, no expressed anger allowed. OK, I can hear you, this is someone with no social skills or someone who doesn’t know how to behave at work. NO, I can assure you I’m not some crazy overly emotional person who runs up and down the hallways screaming that the sky is falling or acting like my hair is on fire. I’m a real person, and real people occasionally get frustrated and angry. I transferred to my 2nd of two positions during my stint at Fannie a year before I was “laid off”. I had 4 managers during that 1 year period of time. What you see on Glassdoor reviews about re-orgs is absolutely true ─ very frequent. They also execute lay-offs about once a quarter. Maybe not unlike some organizations, but hopefully unlike most organizations, they use this lay off cycle to get rid of people they don’t like and don’t want to be bothered with going through formal HR steps that are required “in writing” by the organization to work with the employee to guide the performance of the employee to be more in line with their position or with the desires of their manager. I was told by a colleague that my boss told said colleague that he thought I was a horrible PM (20+yrs experience) and that he planned to “manage me out”, i.e. make me so miserable I would “self-migrate” . My bosses actions had already started to mimic that kind of behavior. He was visibly, with malice of foresight, getting in the way of me doing the job I was hired to do. After 37+ yrs as a professional, it’s not like I’ve never seen this behavior before, but it had never been directed at me personally. If you’ve never had this happen to you, well, great for you! If so, I feel your pain. This behavior stopped at some point after I confronted my manager, but the giant had just gone to sleep. Next lay off, yep, I was gone. Three days later, my old job was posted on the job boards. Never a single word was said to me by my boss that there was a single issue with my performance or any guidance to modify my behavior or deliver anything more or differently than the status quo. With the exception of my boss, and the director who must’ve been complicit, I loved the work I did at Fannie Mae. I was a “one stop shop” POC for the service my team provided. I received multiple service awards and multiple glowing emails from customers who were extremely pleased with the service I provided. I believe the issue was that I wasn’t subservient enough for my authoritarian boss who went to military boys school and has no college education what so ever.",Fannie Mae

878,"""Can be OK depending on your Manager""",3.0,"Benefits and Work-Life Balance. Until the accounting scandal, housing crisis and the government conservatorship, Fannie Mae prided itself on its mission to provide widespread housing; its better-than-average employee benefits; its racial, religious, and sexual diversity; its philosophy that employees maintain a work-life balance through a 37.5-hour work week; and its overall treatment of employees. This is exemplified by an exceptional on-site emergency child care center and free parking, that latter of is unusual for companies operating in the DC area. Recently, the influx of former Wall Street managers has led to a diminshed pride in benefits and work-life balance, but if one gets the right department or manager, work-life balance is still possible. Analytics. Fannie Mae uses a diverse set of predictive models and analytics and often gives employees much leway in conceiving and developing them. If one is in those areas but does not want the pressures of Wall Street, Fannie Mae might provide a more interesting alternative to a commercial bank. Security. Because of the risk-averse nature of the company, managers face a lot of scrutiny when dealing with employees. This means there is some protection against being spontaneously fired by an incompetent or irrational manager, which Fannie Mae certainly has an abudance of. Of course, such protection does not preclude layoffs, or necessarily ensure that manager’s support for a promotion or his discression when informally discussing the employee with other managers at his same level.","Hiring Process. The hiring process is slow and cumbersome. Unless one can use an alternative offer as leverage, from initial contact to offer can take months. And often, interviews are conducted but forgotten shortly thereafter due to a management change or restructuring, which happens much more often than it should. Management Structure. There is a caste system that exist at Fannie Mae between managers and “individual contributers,” and the management hierarchy is enormous, culminating with an exhorbitantly-paid group of executives who are regarded equal to royalty. Because the goal of most of the management staff is to move up into the executive ranks and because the risk averse nature of the company means that promotions can easily be vetoed by just one person, a “suck-up” culture has evolved where any request from senior management no matter how ludicrous is treated as a royal decree with little pushback from middle and lower management. This means that the “individual contributors,” the ones having to deal with such requests, can sometimes find themselves overburdened as the brunt of “tall tale” directives that may have begun as a casual request but grown into major “fire drills” as they have been delegated down the chain. Management Competence. One often wonders whether the push on diversity has succeeded at the expense of competence, particularly at the Director and Vice President levels. It is completely mindboggling how some of the most complex and innovative analytical models can be rejected by managers because the results to not conform to the managers’ preconceived notions. Isn’t that the point of having models to begin with? I can personally recall having to create a spreadsheet with numerical examples for a Vice President to explain why (A*B)+(C*D) will not equal (A+C)*(B+D). Status of Tech Workers. There is less formal heirarchy at Fannie Mae with Financial and Risk at the high end and technology at the low end. Generally, technology workers are not regarded very highly because senior management does appear understand technology. Morale. Because of the government has plans of closing down Fannie Mae, there have been waves of layoffs. As a result, the morale is low and most people are looking for some type of work outside Fannie Mae, in spite of management reassurances that Fannie Mae will be around for a while. This should cause one to consider the reliability of management guidance at the company.",Fannie Mae

No one steps forward and takes the lead on anything, despite all the ""strategy development"" they say they're doing. These guys wouldn't know strategy if it bit them. They refuse to manage performance - that is, those who are below on performance expectations and standards are not managed out.
