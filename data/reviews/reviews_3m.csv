For years, 3M billed itself as being ""innovative"", but they really are not innovative anymore and haven't been for many years. They don't really develop new products any more, they just find new ways to spin their old products and sell them into different markets. And they just buy up their competition and take over their management with 3M zombies. 3M also likes to tell new hires that they can expect to be employed with 3M for their entire career ... and then lay people off when the economy starts to go through the down cycle ... only to replace them a few months later with someone 20 years younger with no work ethic, no knowledge of the workplace.",3M

My base pay was 60k my co-worker from the first shift made over 125k in the last three years so you could imagine how much o.t. he worked. we had mandatory o.t. in some parts of the plant, but most of it was volunteer.","In my 32 years about 7 of it was hell for me and most of us do to very unforgiving management. But after the plant did a plant wide survey, union and non union, 240 surveys were handed in and ""ALL"" surveys were VERY negative, 3M st Paul was shocked by the survey and the work got back to us that it was the worst survey they ever received. But! I give them credit 3M(st paul) within one year all five plant leadership team were gone, two fired three other moved to other plants. I also give credit to the worker's both union and nonunion for standing up to them, that is what got me in trouble,I was always a few years ahead in my opinion of management and they did not like it. So i paid for that when we had the bad managers. When I left 5 months ago the management was ok, no bad eggs. There are not many cons because when you get hired you know what your in for has far as over time and other things that bother some employee's. BUT THE ONE CON I CAN'T LEAVE OUT, IS THERE IS NO PENSION, THEY STOPPED IT TEN YEARS AGO. THEY DO HAVE 401K AND A LITTLE EXTRA MATCH ON SAVINGS FOR new hires.

They are committed to quality and high performance. 3M as a company does a better job with employee training and technical education than any other place I've worked. If you are willing to relocate there are many opportunities to advance within the organization at other 3M divisions,"Touch screens don't necessarily fit 3M's business model. They are costly to produce and demand for the high-end systems 3M makes may not be great enough to sustain the business. Although 3M does their best to keep a culture of innovation, they are a big manufacturing company and have lots of policies and procedures that promote caution, deliberation and avoiding mistakes at all costs. 3M likes to rotate its managers into different business groups. As a result upper management at Touch Systems changed every couple years. Each new manager would need to be educated in the realities of the business. Frequently the new manager would have a grand (and unrealistic) vision for the business that he would try to implement. This led to many false starts. 3M sets its salaries on the high end of average for similar large manufacturing companies. This probably worked out well for chemists in the mid-west but electronics and software engineers in the Boston area received less than they would have at a local tech company",3M

Procedures are poor and management is unwilling to change. This company is well below industry practices when it comes to maintaining compliance. They do as little possible and documentation trail is really poor. Management culture takes recognition from people rather than recognizing direct reports. No empowerment to work harder. Just keep doing the same thing over and over. They definitely enable each other's poor performance and do not recognize individual performers. Employees give typical excuses of that's the way it's always been done so the culture is resistant to changes or improvements. Systems are old and archaic and difficult to navigate.

Now we work rotating 12 hour shifts that make family life difficult, employees are forced to use vacation time when sick (3M will deny this but the system is so rigged that it is vitually impossible to call in sick without accruing disciplinary points - your doctor has to fill out a mountain of paperwork verifying that you could not perform your job duties and if submitted in time, is hardly ever approved), time in and time out has no flexibility making communication difficult and staff was cut, overtime is not only built into the schedule but demanded regularly as well as working holidays, and you must also burn up vacation to take off on a holiday. 3M claims to have a week of ""Other Paid Absences"" which looks good in theory but again employees are given disciplinary points so it's a dangling carrot. Nearly weekly reminders that you must make another sacrifice for ""The Big 3M"".

577,"""Good Company, but Out of Touch""",3.0,"The pay is competitive and the workload is manageable. Because the company is so large and diversified, there are a lot of opportunities to work in different industries and in different roles. Average tenure at 3M is incredibly long (it's not uncommon for employees to have 30+ years at 3M) which I think speaks to the ability to have a career with a lot of variety all at one company. Additionally, there is a strong culture of learning and development. There are constantly seminars and forums for employees to engage in continuous learning and there is generally an enthusiasm around collaboration and continuous improvement.","3M is largely behind other local Fortune 500 companies in terms of benefits for working parents. If you are thinking about accepting a position at 3M and have a family or are considering starting a family in the next 5 years, I would strongly encourage you to discern whether or not you have the financial means to take an unpaid FMLA and/or use all of your vacation time for parenting leave. For maternity leave, you are eligible for 6 - 8 weeks (depending on the type of delivery) of short term disability and any additional time must be taken unpaid. The short term disability benefit varies by years of service, but for most people I know around the office who are expecting they will receive one week of full pay (provided they don't use any sick days in the last 12 months) and 60% pay for the 6-8 weeks. Any leave a new mother wants to take beyond that is unpaid. In the worst case, if a woman must go on bedrest before leave, her family stands to take a huge financial hit. For paternity leave, the official policy of 3m is that one day can be used for the day of the birth. If a father would like to take parenting leave, he can either use vacation or take FMLA unpaid. These policies are in stark contrast to what other local Fortune 500 companies offer (Target recently announced two weeks paid paternity leave and has updated their maternity leave benefits for 2016, Thomson Reuters has 12 weeks paid for maternity and 2 weeks for paternity, UnitedHealth Group also offers 12 weeks paid for maternity leave, Best Buy offers 5 weeks paid for maternity). Additionally, only two weeks of paid vacation is offered to new employees in contrast to other competitors that offer three weeks (Boston Scientific, Target, TR, UnitedHealth Group). Lastly, despite a corporate initiative called ""Flex-Ability"", working from home is still a faux pax and you need to convince supervisors that it can be more productive and often essential to balance the needs of work and home. There is still a strong culture of ""butts in seats"". In an age where companies are acknowledging that employees are retained and more productive when they are able to balance their priorities at work and home, it seems short sighted that 3M likes to boast a competitive compensation package as well as a great company for women when its policies so clearly state the opposite.",3M

However there is a accumulative point system that records the number of OT hours offered vs worked. So if no one signs the board whoever has the lowest # of worked hours has to do it regardless of whatever plans you may have for when you get off work. You don't find out if you have to work until your 1/2 way through the shift. It's hard to plan things when your not sure if you will have to work or not. Also they have a point system in regards to punishment. The system escalates from 1-5. No big deal. However one of the most insane things I've ever encountered is being punished for being sick.

I was closed off from projects I offered the most seasoned expertise in, due to senior leadership very much disliking each other. It was disappointing to not get to leverage my expertise in an arena that so badly needed it, and the constant back-stabbing and bad-mouthing of co-workers that started on day one and never stopped made me very uncomfortable. Also, I was constantly asked to tap my network of digital vendors, agencies and resources to produce RFPs or work for 3M at the 11th hour that never went anywhere. Great way to ruin long-standing working relationships outside of the company. I was not aware of anyone who seemed ""happy"" working there compared to other companies I have worked for. No one smiled, ever. I finally had to start working on projects without telling my manager just to ensure I was doing anything at all and that I was helping them from spending way too much for way too little or just simply doing something not aligned with their audience/customer needs. From a sheer ""company"" perspective, the oddities at 3M Healthcare were endless. There were no refrigerators for employees to store lunch, beverages, etc. It may not sound like a big deal - try it sometime. The lunchroom was open very briefly every day, and offered the worst, most unhealthy and expensive selection of food (if you got there in time to get any) I have ever seen, anywhere. To avoid waste, they provided less food than needed, and anything edible was gone immediately. There's nothing but fast food around there, so going off-site was not a better option. I spent my first three days literally sitting in an empty cube with no computer (which can be typical) but also with nothing to read, ramp-up on, or anyone coming by to say hello or get me situated, manager included. I had to train myself on all systems and getting logins to do so was far more frustrating and time-consuming than usual. The commute is horrid, too, unless you live out that way. There was no discernible process to anything, and trying to instill any was futile. I had to ask folks many times for things they'd promised to deliver, to little avail. I never really knew what I was supposed to be working on, what would come up as ""due"" at any time, or what would be summarily cancelled or taken off my plate - all of this was due to politics. I spent more time in meetings about projects that never moved forward (or that at least our team was ""kicked off of"") than in meetings about viable projects. I attempted to address all of these issues over and over, to no result, and ended up having to print and save the nasty emails between teams their managers to ensure I was never ""blamed"" for something I was not involved in. Not fun. It might be fine for folks that have been there forever, and other divisions may be more advanced in their collaboration and politicking skills not to mention digital savvy.

It's unbecoming of the reputation that 3M has earned in the business world and with their employees previously. They are relying more and more on contract workers to fill gaps and save money without increasing head count or having to provide benefits. For several years of my tenure, contract workers had a reasonably good chance to get hired. In fact, I started as a contract worker and was hired in just over a year. Now, the time you can be on contract is limited and *very few* get hired on as permanent employees. Really good people that you rely on daily can be gone and replaced with a 'newby' at any time and you have to spend precious time training someone else to do what the previous person was very capable of doing. Employee morale is usually high but the recent changes in the C-suite and the decisions that they've been making over the last 2 years have betrayed the trust and dampened the spirit of a lot of people.

If you're a Manager or just start your career way - 3M for you. If you're good specialist - 3M not for you. Low salary, dosn't working with talent. But good work-life balance.

Poor shipping and support causes customer frustration - management turnover is so frequent that they do not understand or develop long term relationships with key customers, as a result, they appear to make short term decisions that may help the bottom line for a year, but really harm the bottom line in future years and also harm customer relationships. Extrememly poor training, used to train sales people in one way or another every year, now, good luck with getting any real training.",3M

If the company exceeds their plan, you get a bigger payout. If they have a rough year, you get less or maybe not anything at all if it is really bad. But beware their trickery! This year they changed it from US & International sales to solely US sales. International was the bulk of business, so they found a way to pay their employees less. New changes to their vacation policy are also upsetting. All vacation is given at the beginning of the year and must be used by Dec 31st, or it disappears. Problem is, some years the plants will close down at Christmas so everybody saves their vacation until the end of the year. Then when end-of-the-year orders come through, everybody has to work. So either take your vacation in the summer and take leave without pay in December, or hold on to your vacation and watch it disappear in December when you're buried in work.",3M

Spent a lot of money in the last couple of years developing a marketing excellence programme, but haven't had the guts to follow it through. Obsessed with detail and data, but won't spend the money on customer research to find out what customers really want. Very technology and manufacturing focused. Low morale amongst marketers who feel undervalued and unable to utilise their skills, and sick of the short term obsession with intricate financial detail. There is a tendency to trust 'the system' rather than the knowledge and experience of the marketers.",3M

In general the managers are human beings and really seek to have the least amount of day to day complications. The work place is pretty diverse in terms of people and almost any lifestyle is acceptable as long as you show up when you are supposed to and try to accomplish something. Flexible working hours are accepted. Being in Health Care instead of some of the other 3M businesses is a huge plus. Health Care is very profitable, how is life making sand paper or roofing granules? I frankly don't want to know.","corporate hierachy, low regards for employees",3M

The technologies are interesting and there is great potential to combine 3M technologies to create new products and markets.,There is a undervaluation of technical expertise at 3M. People who spend an inordinate portion of their time making Powerpoint presentations for upper management advance and those who make massive technical contributions see their careers stagnate. 3M management lets the tail wag the dog in pushing the quality initiative de jour so pervasively that it greatly impedes progress and development. The company reacts to change at a glacial pace and fails to react quickly when markets change. They empire build and then resort to layoffs and write-offs once the tide changes and they've missed the boat.,3M
