International: Substantial international exposure opportunities to work with, or live in 3. Employee Development: Invest significantly in employees (e.g., Stanford program) 4. Pay: Decent salary (though not on high side in Silicon Valley, stock units should be higher Valley) 5. Career Path Opportunity Coming: Big opportunity coming to rise ranks given heavy generational weighting towards Boomers and a huge gap in Gen X’ers to manage the company when the Boomers retire (although they all seem to be hanging on longer than expected) 6. Management Team: I was almost always impressed by the calm, intelligent, non-arrogant nature of the Executives...the jerks got weeded out pretty quickly","1. Title Deflation: many people are doing the work of one level above their title given how many business units under business units there are across company 2. Limited Career Path in Short Term (for Gen X’ers): until the top heavy Boomers really start leaving, but then there will be a huge vacuum of talent missing 3. Mgmt. by Committee: Occasional downside of collegial culture, too many meetings to make decisions by committee 4. Late Cycle Industries/No Growth: Print is the money maker and it’s on a secular decline that 3D printing can’t make up for quick enough, and PCs can’t cover from a margin POV...it’s gonna take time to ever become a growth company again",HP

Company-provided equipment. (Laptops, monitors, etc) 6. Empathy and compassion from management (depending upon your individual manager) if something tragic or traumatic happens. After the death of a parent, my boss let me take four weeks of paid bereavement leave that didn’t come out of my PTO balance.","1. The culture created by management. You’re just a cog in the gargantuan HP machine. HP cares not about your hopes and dreams or your career advancement. Even if you push hard for something like mentorship, which is something they promote, your requests will likely be ignored or pushed aside. 2. Adherence to the bottom line creates job instability for employees. Sudden and unexpected layoff occur. I was “let go” and given fake reasons why. What it came down to was that I was laid off without HP calling it a lay-off so they didn’t have to report it, which would have been detrimental to the stock price. 3. If you get laid off or let go, you won’t see it coming. I had a one-on-one scheduled with my manager. As we were walking to find a conference room, we chatted like it was any other day. Just chitchat. Then we walked into a conference room in a different building and he immediately hit me with the news I was being let go. When I questioned why, he gave me a made up reason related to my performance. When I challenged him and told me he was incorrect, he fumbled over his words and gave me a different reason that was equally made up. 4. Lack of interaction with management. In the nearly five years I worked at HP, I can probably count on two hands the number of times I had real interaction (something beyond chitchat) with the two different managers for whom I worked. 5. Also, if you accept a severance package, as I did, you will never be eligible for rehire. EVER. After working for HP for 4 years and just shy of 11 months, my severance package was a half a month’s pay, but no one ever told me I’d never be able to come back and my severance paperwork never indicated as much, either. 6. Favoritism. This is definitely a problem. My first manager took the words of another person I worked with as the God’s honest truth when that person blamed me for a mistake she made. My manager never even asked me if I knew anything about the problem created by this other person. She just automatically assumed the problem arose because of me. I was told “you set us back weeks” after this other person mucked up some data she was analyzing for a new metric. This other person had asked me to look at the data and run a test, which I did exactly as she asked me to. I ran the test on literally 100 rows out of 100,000 rows for approximately 15 minutes and didn’t save anything. My second manager played favorites and I felt as if I had been “left behind” (for lack of a better term) while the other new hires I worked with were brought along much more quickly than I was. The other two new people on the team were given special treatment and paid special attention that I wasn’t. It helped if you were an athlete of some kind or if you liked mountain biking. That helped you “fit in” with the little clique created by my manager. Apparently I didn’t “fit in” because I didn’t join them on their mountain biking trek or their whitewater rafting trip one summer.",HP

We had all been given excellent reviews, the budget seemed fine, and the reason given was a need to ""refresh the talent pool"". We were given a severance package and 60 days (during a forced holiday shutdown) to find a job within the company.

If you do not work overtime, you cannot keep up with workloads as they purposely plan to give more work than employees can do in 40 hours. Required working through vacations! Even on vacation, most positions it's required to check and respond to emails, even do file work for your position. I have never once had a real vacation off and a couple of them turned into regular 12 hour working days that I never even got to see my family except at dinner. Very strong political views.

New blood in management is bringing fresh ideas into a older company. * Career opportunities are stagnating but HP does do a good job of promoting from within. * Benefits are slightly above average but have tended to get more restrictive over time. * HP pays generous signing bonuses for new employees.","HP has in recent years fallen off as an employer of choice In my opinion. First the business has suffered greatly in the marketplace as the sale of its products and its market share has declined. This has led to a great deal of turnover and volatility in the business. Hiring at HP has been slowed to frozen at times and in my own experience my staff was never back-filled when someone left. When I came to HP I was being considered for promotion. Now, after several years, the company has split, my staff divided and gone, and now I am no longer even a manager much less promoted. Career? Dead end at HP! Other Cons include: * HP's remote worker policy that HP was known for has all but been eliminated. * Salary increases hover around 1-2% YoY even for top performers. * In my best year, 2 months after receiving a productivity award, I received a 1.1% raise. * Bonuses: With my staff eliminated after HP split, my bonuses on avg will fall from >$10K to ~$5K if lucky.. * Work/family balance is still decent at HP, but has declined in the last 2 years. * Some staff resistant to obstinate about collaboration and working together in EMEA. I cannot recommend HP as a place to work right now (2016) because of the volatility. Too many workforce reductions in recent months and years and the threat of more loom in the near future make a recommendation untenable.",HP
649,"""Stagnant and Sisyphean career.""",2.0,"-Decent work-life balance depending on your team -Starting salary was great for a college graduate, benefits would be solid for a family man I'd imagine -More laid back work culture than typical office jobs (but not at the google/facebook level) -Depending on your group, it can get very egalitarian; I've had the privilege to speak to the president of my organization and he took my input very seriously.","-You get looked down on for being a younger employee, company is primarily baby boomers an the culture is very resistant to change (the number of older employees that gripe for ""the Compaq Days"" is nuts). Could be my organization that's the issue here, but I've had coworkers in other groups tell me similar stories. -Company claims about quality are poorly demonstrated when known mistakes are repeated over and over again i.e. having ODM's take on the bulk of design work, significant resistance to changes that would make a product more robust, etc. -Many solutions to address employee gripes or concerns are very convoluted and I feel miss the point. There was a lot of noise about a lack of career development so we launched a social learning platform that requires employees to do all the work teaching others without additional incentives... what? Wouldn't it had just been simpler to get a new learning tool like Lynda or something other than the crappy one we had? -Raises and bonuses are based on a ""trickle down"" mentality, essentially if your team outshines everyone else in the company but the organization as a whole screws up, you get nothing or punished for it. The team I was on supported multiple sides and teams in the company but the fact that my parent organization didn't do well meant that I didn't reap any of the benefits. -It's easy to get caught in the wave of work that comes in and feel like a workhorse doing the same thing on a day to day basis. The spark that came with the new challenges and research is pretty much gone now and I feel that it might be time to find a new career.",HP

It looks amazing from the outside but when you dig in a little bit you see the true meaning of those words: if you need to destroy someone's career or reputation or become friends with... in order to get promoted, then do it. - Socialization matters more than good job. - If a colleague is not working and delays a project, you'd better not ask your manager to encourage him to work better as you will get bad reputation for it and probably won't get your bonus. - If a manager is not doing a good job and all this team leaves the team (it has been a real situation), he is seen as a hero and gets promoted. - Technical people that don't do their job, get promoted to managers. - Most manager don't know how to manage people. - Really tight deadlines for project development so they prioritize time over quality. - If there are two candidates applying for the same position and one is family of friend of, even if the other candidate is the perfect person for the position it will not be hired. - There are entire families working on the same departments. - Too many managers: there are more managers than technical staff and even what they call 'people managers' without 'people' - Too many people that leave their work to 'their' contractors, do nothing and get awarded for it. - Too many managers and 'colleagues' unscrupulous who don't mind step over you to be promoted. - After asking for the action the company does to keep good professionals, I was told there was nothing of the sort. - After someone from HP international went to the offices in late 2017, engineers' salary was increased by 30% as is was way under salary range.",HP
