The culture isn’t as stuffy as other companies I’ve worked for, they really believe if you take care of your own, they’ll take care of the customer. There isn’t a tool I’ve needed that wasn’t offered to me to do my job well. I’ve also never seen so many senior leaders so accessible to their associates. They have great leadership programs which allow college kids to gain the experience they need to be successful in management later. They also have programs to develop mid-management and senior leadership as well. I’ve been given incredible support to do my job and everyone has been willing to help me. It’s not unusual for people to move around to gain cross functional experience. When people leave positions it’s still usually to stay at the company. Also love that there’s so much flexibility to work from home - a huge plus for working parents. Performance reviews are based on ongoing conversations with management vs a ten page document that you have to write up at the end of the year. It definitely forces you to stay engaged with your leaders on what’s going on. There’s a big emphasis on educating employees around difference between diversity vs inclusion - i appreciate that this company goes deeper than just making the company “look” different. CEO has a huge part in diversifying company and is very active in veteran and military support. Overall I’m really happy here, sure there’s still some typical corporate annoyances but there’s none of the toxic behaviors I saw at my last company. I sit near contractors who are sticking around and not taking other gigs in the hopes of getting fully employed by Cigna one day - that’s a nice testament to their experience.",Company getting bigger with Express Scripts acquisition so might be losing that personal touch a little but so far so good.,Cigna

Majority of the jobs are boring monotonous cubicle dead end jobs. If that's what you're looking for then Cigna is right for you. Ironically for working for an insurance company the health benefits were not very good. Very high deductible plans if you want something affordable living on your low pay job.

636,"""Actuarial Executive Development Program""",5.0,"The AEDP has incredible growth potential with exposure to a wide array of products, even when not working directly with them. The brown bags and conferences gave me a wide understanding of the company, its products, and its strategies. The management really encourages this learning and wants you to be well rounded and connected so you can become a leader in the organization. The results from the program are amazing - most members who complete it go on to be leaders in the company. Cigna and the AEDP is an excellent place to begin a career. The learning and exposure in the AEDP is so wide and deep, and the community encourages this immensely. I'm very glad I had the chance to be a part of this community and experience. If you want to be a business oriented actuary, there is no place better to be than Cigna's AEDP. Once you get through the program, you'll have plenty of exposure and knowledge for whatever product you want to work with, and Cigna has a very wide array of businesses. You'll almost surely find something you're passionate about to work on. Salary and Benefits are all good/competitive, though it may make sense to have a cost of living adjustment between locations rather than just have a standard $$$ the same for Philadelphia vs. Austin. 401K has a good match, reasonable insurance options, 18 days PTO to start, becomes 23 at FSA, plus the standard holidays. Plenty of study hours for exams, enough study materials covered by company as well.","The opportunities within the AEDP are all business oriented, and less technical than I hoped they would be. I had less influence in choosing my second rotation than I hoped for. If you're looking to be a technical specialist in the actuarial field working with cutting edge mathematics and predictive modelling, Cigna's AEDP probably isn't the place for you (though you may want to look at some of the roles in the TechDP since there's some marginal work going on there in the data science side of things).",Cigna

It's merely an ideal that management mentions to hide the fact that Cigna is 1/4 of a step from indentured servitude. -Focus groups and HR do NOTHING so no need to express your concern. I'm sure this too is a ploy to keep the DOL off our backsides - The CEO is pretentious- didn't really talk to employees below the directors when he visited the office - Did I mention turnover is HIGH? Even team leaders have resigned and their entire team is being dispersed to other teams - You're required to do duties weeelllll beyond your job title/level and well beyond your pay grade because management has ""put in their time"" once -The office in certainly crashing and burning from a departmental perspective - if you're good, they retain you because of a business need but if you're horrible at your job you either get accommodated elsewhere or you're allowed to stay and destroy claims even more - High level of unprofessionalism in management. They talk about employees and even pit them against each other; it becomes a game of loyalty and friendship not about work and your character. - there's so much more but so little space. Employees in general are unhappy but afraid to say anything because it may ruffle feathers or they don't because the complaint isn't taken seriously - its corporate America.

Benefits are very generous--but they should be, it's an insurance company. Still, if you're just looking for a place to work where you can show up, keep your head down, and make a good living, this is it. Totally disengaged and uninterested managers are more concerned with feeding the bureaucracy means you'll mostly face low expectations of actual-performance and mostly have your job-performance reviewed on a number of ludicrous quasi-politically-correct seeming things like ""Cultural accumen"" (something like that.) There is some opportunity for mobility within the company outside of the IT groups, and some non-IT roles are able to negotiate the ""working from home"" thing--but that policy is far from universal.","Politics--there is a ton of it, and it directly impacts If you want more than to just ""show up and keep your head down"" until you're ready to retire, this organization is not for.

Internal IT products (i.e. home-brewed) are mostly a joke--one year I had to enter my performance review THREE TIMES because the system Cigna IT built simply ate it. Beyond this, the management style is that of a massive, top-down bureaucracy. Ideas from rank and file workers not taken seriously, mostly ignored unless repackaged by a senior-enough Cigna executive that people feel obligated to listen. Somehow, in 2014, this company did not have a coherent ""Work from Home"" policy. They CLAIM to have one, but after the umpteen rules of qualification for getting permisison to do so, the final one is ""And your manager has to agree."" Meaning, as a practical matter, there is no universal policy on working form home since, in the end, a hovering micro-manager can simply say ""No, I don't approve"" on any flimsy reason (or even no reason at all other than ""because I say so.""

New medical underwriters were hired on at a lower salary than some of the dental underwriters. It was nonsense. There are people who work within the company who have literally created new spreadsheets that can do calculations and save tons of time and money for the company (other underwriters would use these spreadsheets) but you wouldn't hear a thing from management about this. Management prefers drone-like employees who have no opinions: you come into work, you leave work. There are underwriters who have been with the company for over 20 years whose work is just overwritten by management for no real reason (well, other than ""we need to hit sales goals""). I don't understand - why even bother with actuarial data and facts when there are ""sales goals"" that need to be met? This didn't happen just once or twice, but basically the entire time I was there I saw it on a daily basis (yes, daily). I would deal with underwriters stressing out about audits, reviews, critique panels, training, traveling, work hours (14+ hours per day during busy season and 10+ hours per day during regular season), poor pay, poor insurance benefits, poor vacation, lack of time off, etc. The amount of complaining was ridiculous - I worked with about 50 other UWers and only a handful liked their job. Most of the other UWers were there because they couldn't find other work, they lacked the confidence to try to find work elsewhere, or they just liked being miserable. I think the poor morale is what did it for me in the end. Turnover is unbelievable. The company needs to hire about 100% more people than it thinks it will need every year because half of the new hires will quit within two years. In 6 months, half of my specific hiring class had quit (and we all worked in different locations - so it wasn't just my location specifically). Because so many people quit before peak busy season, the work volume increases significantly for the rest of the employees - who are then expected to get all that work done in the same time (translation: work 14+ hours M-F and on weekends for about four months straight). Granted, some employees have better time-management skills than others, but the UWing job is very detail oriented and requires a lot of time regardless of how fast you work. Nonetheless, when it's ""slow"" employees are scoffed at when they need to leave an hour early for a doctor's appointment or personal issue. I mean, if you're working 80 hours a week for three-four months straight, you'd expect some leniency the rest of the year - nope.

A nice raise and good bonus will definitely keep the employees engaged and will want to come in for work and not look for a different company to work for. We need the motivation instead we get discourage and feel unappreciated by the lack of compensation we get for our everyday hard work. They say we are getting paid at market value but find that, that might be good to some employees working in states where cost of living is cheap, what about employees who live in states or cities where cost of living is high- that would make market value not matter.

Not to mention they treat these people poorly and many leave the program due to it. I've never worked somewhere with so many inexperienced developers. Even those that are so called senior engineers or managers don't even know the fundamentals of the IT industry. There is a DevOps team here that is used as a crutch.

I feel dirty working here. Communication is a problem. A lot of people seem to be trying to protect their jobs by making it difficult to finding information. ""Its not my job, talk to so-and-so.""

Of course this benefited some - mostly the higher ups who were already making alot of money. The money is not good and the raise are lousy - maybe good year is 2.5% no more. Also, when you work as an AA, I had two situations where my managers kept adding in more and more people for me to support. This was done so he/she could appease the peers they had and the matrix partners. So essentially I was working for the same money - no compensation was given for the extra work, there was no reward for the extra support at the compensation time and it was a demoralizing feeling but I was being required to please more people and it couldn't be done all the time. Most middle managers - (maybe not all, but alot) - and this applied to the Band 4 and Band 5 managers have a strong sense of entitlement and feel superior - they can be rude and mean to those below them. I think this results from them making so much money and have an overestimated sense of importance. They get away with treating others like dirt because when push comes to shove the higher manager will tend to give then the benefit of the doubt and/or back them up.

The TECDP program not really technical but more business frat like. Associates are required to run and plan administrative functions like networking events and recruiting which distracts from actual technical part of the job. There's too much politics and your performance is partially determined by feedback from fellow associates who worked with you once or twice on projects within the development program but not actually with you on a technical project. People can be really critical and leave you really bad feedback without a second thought because they don't have to deal with you or see you everyday. Your performance seems to be based on how well known your name is within the program for taking on mostly non-technical project managing tasks such as planning a training event. Leadership in the program is filled with ambitious/power hungry associates who like to boss people around and make as much drama as possible. There are good people in the program but they don't make themselves known and stay out of the politics. Your salary is managed by the program but most of your time is suppose to be spent supporting Cigna in an IT function. This creates a great conflict of interest on whether you actually want to focus your time on playing along with TECDP politics or on actually developing your IT skills. On top of that even though you are an adult now, the program managers expect you to drop your daily work and go to mandatory training sessions. These training sessions are not technical in nature but rather include all day long presentations on general company propaganda or vague IT buzzwords like DevOps or big data.

There are a lot of people (men and women) who work from home several times a week. It is not looked down upon in anyway and motivates people to work harder while they are at work. Even senior leadership sometimes work from home on Fridays and have conference calls with subordinates over the phone. I have never seen a company that actually backs up claim of a work/life balance as much as CIGNA does. It is also relatively easy to move within the different divisions of the company. It is rare that a person who was looking to move internally was ever blocked or discouraged from doing so. There are so many different internal opportunities available that you truly never have to leave the company unless you are just completely unsatisfied.,"The forced bell curve for performance review really stifles the feedback process and can sometimes demotivate people. This can be great if you are working with peers in your group but can difficult if the range of talent is broad. For example, if you are in a group with several senior members and you are the only junior member, by default your performance review will almost always be on the low. Your performance is never just graded by itself but rather compared to others. Like most companies, there are a lot of politics involved in getting a promotion or moving ahead. This isn't just special to CIGNA. When there were layoffs, CIGNA could have been more transparent with the process. It led to a lot of rumors and fears among the employees.

CIGNA is a company that fosters professional growth through tution reimbursement and through it's intensive library of internal training materials (through CIGNA University) in a vast range of topics. CIGNA also offers a service called Books 24 x 7, which allows employees to access digital copies of books on buisness, information technology, human resources, and personal well-being topics. CIGNA has a dedicated middle-management staff concerned about their employees. CIGNA provides ample time off (2 weeks of vacation when you are first hired, with the option to purchase a third week through payroll deduction, and they give you an extra week of paid vacation once you reach 5 years of employment). Benefits provided are well-rounded (including medical, dental, pharmacy and vision insurance, short-term disability, long-term disability, and various dependant care plans), although it is important to know that CIGNA employee benefits are not richer simply because CIGNA is an insurance company. Like most companies, employee costs for insurance benefits have increased in the last decade as overall health care costs in the United States have become more expensive. Information Technology professionals at CIGNA will find an environment that fosters innovative thought, although administative ""red tape"" barriers are cumbersome. CIGNA is a company with innovative programs and anyone considering employment can be assured that hard work at CIGNA can result in a very satisfying career.","CIGNA departments tend to exist without proper communciation levels that can lead to headaches. Newer leadership is doing a better job battling this challenge, but CIGNA has a way to go. Information Technology (IT) professionals will quickly learn that ""red tape"" surrounds their jobs. Most IT professionals prefer spending time doing IT tasks, but CIGNA IT professionals typically find that about 15% of their time is spent focused on jumping through administrative hoops. Application development at CIGNA requires a significant amount of planning, and securing funding for large projects requires employees to prove that their project will result in hard-dollar savings. Minor application changes require approval by senior IT leadership, so the process can challenge the patience of even the most level-headed IT pro.

Vacation, sick and personal days are all lumped into one category. Unlike places that designate a certain amount of vacation, sick and personal days per year, CIGNA lumps them all into one. There are complaints about our healthcare choices. If you're a relatively healthy person who only needs routine check-ups, these plans are for you. Otherwise you might find yourself complaining about deductibles or HRA funds. I don't find pay to be competitive at all.
