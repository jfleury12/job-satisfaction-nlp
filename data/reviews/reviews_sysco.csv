This is also considered ""base pay"" rates. The average delivery driver at my location makes upwards of $100k per year. Paid holidays, matches 401k (to ""X"" percentage), again AWESOME management team. Always eager to tell and coach when needed.","Biweekly pay. Pallets are built by whom I can only assume are kinder garden children in adult male bodies. Very unorganized which makes finding each item for each individual stop challenging and down right frustrating at times. Delivery times are unrealistic.

Typical delivery driver cons.",Sysco

276,"""Corporate IT Dept - Great benefits, good culture (mostly)""",4.0,"-Great benefits including ""extras"" outside of the typical insurance/401k structure -Most senior management in IT are great leaders, empowering and motivational -A culture of pitching in together and doing it right, big emphasis on ethics and code of conduct -Dynamic environment (if you enjoy a challenge and shifting gears) -Values diversity, longevity, and employee growth - lots of opportunities to grow your skills in leadership, job-related areas, and elsewhere -Some positions compensation is above market Overall, I think the pros outweigh the cons for my personal taste. I work well in an environment that changes - over the 3 years that I've worked in IT at Sysco, we've changed our management structure 3 times, changed IT strategy at least twice, and adopted new methodologies twice. Communication can be a challenge, but the change is generally well done so as along as you are comfortable switching gears, you'll be fine. Sysco offers a great benefits package including decent vacation/time-off and good ""perks"" like holiday hams and employee purchasing. The company also values employee learning and growth, and puts major effort into offering coaching/learning opportunities, especially if you are interested in management roles or learning better leadership. Compensation seems to be above market in some positions while under market in others, so it's hit or miss.","-Dynamic environment (if you don't adapt well to change) -IT specific: Very siloed, other departments will do their own thing, not much knowledge transfer between departments so you often compete with each other for resources unknowingly -IT specific: support is mostly managed services, and the companies providing those services are not very focused on ""the customer experience"", so you often have to clean up their work -Technology is ancient -Some mid-level managers are inflexible and demotivating, leading with more of a carrot/stick mentality. -IT specific: There's still a big grudge when Sysco unilaterally laid off most of the IT department (and brought in managed services) about 5 years ago or so, so those who have been around since before then often have a bone to pick and get very disgruntled quickly. It can be hard to work with those managers at times because they're too busy being upset about the decision made, and not interested in collaboration/furthering the business -IT specific: Because most roles are filled by managed services companies, career growth within IT is very limited unless you go into management -(might be a con to you) Often expected to go the extra mile, work outside of the typical 9-5 The cons are generally limited to roles that require collaboration and communication cross-functionally within the IT department. If your role will not require working with other groups often, then they may not apply much to you. Also, if you are looking for more technical roles, and are not interested in moving in management, the career opportunities are severely limited, though I see some of that changing in emerging technologies like cyber security and cloud architecture. In IT especially, you're often expected to put in extra work to meet deadlines or support major releases in off-hours. You also tend to get too many assignments, so your work/life balance may suffer a bit. I've noticed this in other departments, too, that the expectation is to do what needs to be done - if you're a ""roll your sleeves up, get to work"" kind of person, this shouldn't be a problem. However, if you're motivated by a more structured environment with clear roles/responsibilities and boundaries, then this may not be the right culture for you. Unrelated to IT specifically, the environment is extremely dynamic which can be a con if you are not flexible/adaptable. The company also uses very old technology as a backbone for its core systems, which can fail unexpectedly during business hours. Depending on your role, some of the systems you need to do your job may break once a week or once a month. However, support is usually pretty quick to get things working again (....unless you get one of the offshore groups, for some reason the company they picked to provide offshore support has no interest in comprehending problems, so they waste 2-3 days just trying to ask you the same questions over and over again)",Sysco

Baugh had grown up on a ranch near Waco, Texas, and got his start in the food business through a part-time job at a local A&P grocery store when he was in high school. He eventually founded Zero Foods Company of Houston, a Houston-based food distributor. In 1969 Baugh convinced the owners of eight other small food distributors to combine the nine companies, forming what he hoped to mold into a national food-service distribution organization, one that would be able to distribute any food despite its regional availability. The other eight original companies were: Frost-Pack Distributing Company (Grand Rapids, Michigan); Global Frozen Foods, Inc. (New York); Houston's Food Service Company (Houston); Louisville Grocery Company (Louisville, Kentucky); Plantation Foods (Miami, Florida); Texas Wholesale Grocery Corporation (Dallas); Thomas Foods, Inc. and its Justrite Food Service, Inc. subsidiary (Cincinnati); and Wicker, Inc. (Dallas). The combined 1969 sales for the nine founding companies were $115 million. Currently the vision is yet the same with the economic demands and crisis still yet SYSCO finds a way to stay above the rest.",The Cons are typical with any other company of such magnitude.

This is a man who oppresses people, treats his staff with almost no respect and demoralizes most everyone he has reporting to him. I then quickly remembered that all of his cronies have been put into senior management positions so quite honestly, nothing will change. This is an organization that has been built on how to use scare tactics in to getting their employees to work 7 days a week and almost be fearful of missing a work related call for the backlash that it could cause. I still talk to many people at the company and no matter what department they are in or level they are at, they all echo the same feelings. In my many years there the negativity and poor morale had become so ingrained in the culture through senior managers it will never be able to leave as long as those same people sit in the positions they are in. This is a company that doesn't promote based on talent, they promote based on who Keith has the best relationship with at that time. In addition to that, they do not train or develop their staff. The company simply let them sink or swim. If you are placed into a new role you can expect that you will have a grace period of about a month to know every single function of your job but you will have zero training or coaching along the way. The people who I still talk to that have gotten out have gone on to thrive at either other Sysco operating companies, with corporate or at other food service companies but never at Baltimore. Sysco Baltimore does not take talented people and work with them to make the organization better. They take talented people and beat them down with unrealistic expectations and zero top down help. Now, they will say they will help and always say they are there when you need them but when it boils down to it, don't expect much. In addition you cannot do anything in the building without the approval of either the VP or President. When I was in sales I couldn't take a customer to lunch without getting approval of them before taking the customer to lunch. You have to have the presidents approval to get a customer off credit hold. I don't know how this makes sense but I want my senior leaders focusing on big picture and not day to day items they should empower their managers to make. The operations and transportation department are a constant crutch for this company. The problem is two fold. The lack of senior leadership to rally their troops is glaring and the lack of talent to pull from is undeniable. Since the senior leadership won't change in the building this company needs to take a long look at how to bring in better talent for these departments, and keep the talent! The last thing I have is that they do not empower their middle management to make any decisions on their own. They expect amazing results with no support and no empowerment. This company will always be exactly what it is, a breeding ground for poor morale, zero leadership in the senior level positions, no development of talent and a complete lack of understanding the business that they are in. The sad fact of the matter is that now that I work for another company I see that they had really good and very talented people in place but they are not empowered to do their jobs.",Sysco

Realistically, if you are self-motivated, keep your sales up, keep your customers happy and manage your territory properly, there is a lot of freedom to prospect, set meetings around your schedule, work with specialists and even take 30 to drop your rod in to a nearby stream if the weeks been too long. In food-service, within Colorado, Sysco Denver is the company to work for.","No company reimbursement for auto/ insurance, cellphone or relocation which are all mandatory requirements for hire. This is more than a full-time job; customers will call day or night with issues and the expectation that you have solutions to problems that are out of your control. There are almost too many moving pieces and areas where things may go wrong with vendors, shortages, agreements, customer ordering errors, truck shorts/ damaged product, delivery times, etc. All of these things are your responsibility to fix – and quickly because your competition has promised perfection. Drivers are union and may call out of work, deliver slowly or have a poor attitude about their job. I have noticed that when this behavior is reported, supervisors rarely follow up or reprimand drivers. At times it feels like transportation and sales are two competitive companies working against each other. The union aspect hurts the OpCo as a whole but getting rid of it would force many good drivers to find work elsewhere.",Sysco

695,"""Marketing Associate / Outside Sales""",2.0,You will meet a lot of new people that could sustain long term relationships but other than that I cant really think of to much else.,"To many sales people in the market, less opportunities to open up new business. Depending on your District Sales Manager you will not get much support. Company could set you up to fail and not even realize your struggle and not care until numbers don't match up and then start the blame game which will be all your fault. Filling voids in management with warm bodies don't cut it. Company will hire you to hit the street and 1/3 wont make it. There is a lot of timing and luck involved in this job as much as knowing how to sell and overcoming customers objections while trying to create a value for the customer. You'll open up a few new accounts, then as soon as you hit a dry spell and the company as a whole does not hit their projections due to their own miss management or acts of god, they will look to find ways to cut expenses and you will be one of them while they continue to profit on the customers that you did open. Kind of a pyramid scheme in a way. I do not recommend THIS career especially if the economy is not thriving and NY State restaurant employment wages continue to reach $15 and hour with owners having to shut their doors for good, let alone trying to purchase food from Sysco that isn't cheap either with margins in favor of the house. They can't afford to stay open. Your up against tough odds to open new business with this company in NYS. If you do look for this type of career steer away from Sysco, to big, to corporate to many rules and time wasted. I believe the corporation would be better suited for sales people to sell by knocking on doors being out there to do what they do best and each one should have their own hourly PA (personal assistant) to do all the computer work and planning.

Sysco offers great training for sales rep (2 months in the classroom) as well as continuing training seminars. Management is also open to reps suggestions for improvement and I have seen management make some changes based on the feedback they receive. You also get to work outside the office with this position and can make your own schedule. The company tends not to micro-manage but there are always some micromanagers out there so this will depend on which manager you get. You also get to build your own customer base (if not too many accounts are giving to you) and have the freedom to choose which customers you want to deal with on a weekly basis (for the most part).","The biggest con about working here is that this company does NOT pay for your expenses (car and toll) which can be a huge expense. Im pretty surprised they have been able to get away with this for this long. Second biggest con is that they expect you to work part of the day on Sunday. Customers will sometimes call you or text you off hours. The commission structure is also pretty awful (although they have been trying to make some changes recently) and you make very little to no additional commission outside of base salary depending on your area- since its all about margin dollars. They also EXPECT you to participate on their food ""shows"" which sometimes fall on Saturday or Sunday with no additional compensation. The work/life balance with this company is pretty bad to say the least. Many MA's quit or are fired within the first year and they are constantly doing training seminars for new hires.

Pretty much everyone wants to leave but a lot of people are just too old or scared to try and find something new.","This location has gone down so bad here in the past 2 years. They decreased the pay tremendously. They continue to find ways to make the goals harder and pay less. You work long hours and have tiring goals (comparable to amazon) The management is getting worse and worse. They cant keep anything under control. They do not know how to schedule people. The management is very inappropriate towards some of the staff. Now that a specific manager is in control you see they are leaning more towards a certain race when they hire. They have new rules every single day. New reasons to write people up. They say your family is important and they want them to always come first. Not true. You're just constantly lied to on a daily basis. They have no respect for the employees that run this company. All they care about is how to make more money and pay you less. They cant keep a good staff. We have an extremely bad turnover rate. Not even worth remembering people . You can try to apply for every change to advance in the company, but if the manager has a grudge against you regardless if you would be great at the job, he will not let you move up. There is not really any opportunity. They always hire from outside when there are 70-80 different people inside on nights they could hire within. The slot coordination is absolutely terrible and they don't seem to care. They tell you to give them your ideas to make it better, do not even bother wasting your time. If you do give them your ideas it just goes in the trash because they aren't willing to make changes because they want it their way even though you are the selector and could have it much better with just one little change. 2 separate times it was so bad that corporate had to come out and survey the warehouse. They had everything so perfect to make it look so good and they only really change things when corp is out or there is a threat of a union. But there will probably never be a union because they bribe you so much once the union tries to get in that you forget how bad it is. Once all that is over they go back to their ways. Basically every error falls on the selector. Nobody else. If you're looking to go somewhere here, you might as well just start out as a driver, or in the office. The pay is greater than other warehouse, but its definitely falling and will be on all the other warehouse level pays one day. The survey company that has come out completely messed up the cold side for how fast you need to move to maintain a 100% but the dry side is cake walk. But unfortunately if you come to sysco as a selector you will be put in the freezer. That is where all the new guys have to go. It used to be a privilege to work on the cold side and make more. Now you work harder for less. Good luck to anyone who comes to sysco in the future. Things will not be under control for a very long time. P.s In the summer the hours are short and the temps get any overtime that there is. They refuse to let you come in on your days off or stay after and get the hours if you want them. It cost too much to let the legal citizens get the hours so they let the illegal temps that hardly make any money get all the hours.",Sysco

Drive cams are a joke - constantly going off for safely braking at lights or when another driver cuts you off and again the Sysco driver is faulted and penalized.

1035,"""Very misleading interview and unsatisfactory employment experience""",1.0,Freedom in your schedule - you don't to use a personal day if you have an appointment. You can rearrange your schedule to accommodate things that may come up.,"So Many! Lets start from the beginning. - I was told I would make 70-80,000/year. That was a huge lie based on where I am located. I am in a rural area and that income is not achievable where I am. - I work every Sunday... which they somehow forgot to tell me would happen when I was hired. - I was hired on a weekly base which DROPPED after so long and I was not informed that would happen. - Formal training is 6 weeks in a classroom environment. They pump you so full of information in that period there is no way you could remember it all. It would be much more effective to learn most of the info in the field and do periodic training in a classroom. - You pay for home computer paper and ink with no reimbursement despite the fact that you are require to print pages upon pages of information for your customers. - Up until recently I had a computer that was borderline working against me most days. After almost 2 years with it, I was finally issued a new one which is a lot better! - The requirement of attending a general sales meeting each month that is almost 4 hours from where I live/work. Mileage is not reimbursed. - The requirement of attending a monthly district sales meeting which is over 1 hour from me and mileage is not reimbursed. - The expectation of bringing customers to the main Sysco building almost 3 hours away. The expectation is to do this once a month/12 times a year. Mileage not reimbursed. - On the above mentioned trips, you are expected to front money to take said customer out for dinner and drinks. This you are reimbursed for but you often have to wait a month or more for the expense report to get approved and the money to be deposited into your account. - Zero work life balance. I get calls from customers all days of the week, all hours of the day. This company knows no boundaries. - No matter what day or time it is, you'd better have your computer with you in case a customer calls and needs a question answered. - Poor support from merchandising. Emails with questions about products either go unanswered or get answered in an unacceptable amount of time (i.e. after cut-off for placing orders causing you to lose a sale). - So many superiors! There are so many people in position above me that I have no idea what they do or who they oversee. - Red tape on everything. If you make the 3 hour drive to bring you customer to the office, front money for dinner out with them, plan a nice visit and the customer decides they would like to tour the facility, you are out of luck. That would have needed to be scheduled a week in advance. - Quality control is poor. Rotting or moldy produce makes it to the customer often leading to more work for you having to write credits and scramble to find replacements so the customer has product. - The company has different expectations from their competition leading us uncompetitive in the field. Sysco tells us they can't stop the truck at an account for less than $500; the competition will stop for $250. Sysco tells us we have rock bottom prices on items; the competition is selling the same item (same name, size, box) for less than our ""cost"".

Today, that's farthest from the truth than ever before; it's all about bottom line. They used to love and care about their employees also but ever since the economy downturn, they have slashed their employees careers; jobbed customer service and I.T. out to INDIA, forced each and every other REMAINING employee to take cut pays and increased their workload to exhaustion. I worked as Marketing Associate for almost 18 years and finally threw in the towel. I was tired of the demands they made of me; all expected to be done with a smile on my face…They cram too many cases in the trucks, overloading them to max capacity which hurt not only the drivers and their nightmares trying to dig through it all but then the product was compromised by being smashed all around during transit and the customers were held hostage waiting longer than they should have to because they put an average of 24 stops on the trucks which was ridiculous. They also made it IMPOSSIBLE to service the customer by allowing the Marketing Associate to hand deliver ANY PRODUCT INCLUDING PAPER CUPS because of some STUPID FEAR of being sued. There was an ISOLATED incident with chicken in a hot shed or something like that in San Francisco, so they got all paranoid and placed a ZERO TOLERANCE policy for any and all Marketing Associate to even TOUCH a product whether it was perishable or not. So Joe Blow has a wedding and Sysco screws up and leaves a case of plastic plates off the truck. Solution….Marketing Associate can run to warehouse and pick it up and get it to the caterer within the hour….but NOT ANYMORE….nope, the customer has to go to Sam's Club or Restaurant Depot….better yet, they can call any of Sysco's competitors and get it done…. and on and on and on…..so, I quit. They told my customers I ""retired"". I gingerly tell them when I see them, NO I DID NOT RETIRE, I QUIT! Oh, by the way, they also cut our pension by 2/3's and any new employee does not get one at all.

Able to set up and establish your own performance plan. • Receive free food on a regular basis (ex: sweets, bagels, breads). • Have an excellent, state-of-the art fitness center and a variety of fitness programs. • Have an interactive online classes to hone your skillset.","• Very poor work-life balance. Often forced to work overtime and long-hours (including your lunch brake, night, and weekends) with no pay in order to meet tight deadlines on projects that management dumps on you at the last minute. • Management is eager to load you down with projects and expect you to make a way to make it work so that you can complete them by their respective deadlines. This typically results in employees having to work overtime on a regular basis. • Lack of quality control . Employees are expected to make no mistakes in their work and to have high quality standards. However, their is not a revision process in which management and other team members can catch mistakes before projects are submitted to stakeholders. Mistakes are often found after projects are submitted, which results in reworks. • Lack of automation. Everything is manual in Microsoft Excel; no macros. This results in having to work long hours due to the tedious, manual labor, energy, and time necessary to complete project work. COMPANY NEEDS TO USE MACROS AND STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES to streamline and speed up recurring processes used in projects so that employees are NOT overworked. • Managers disrespect their employees. They do not value their contributions or time. There is no reward system and very little recognition given to employees in going above and beyond the call of duty. Managers expect employees to manage and prioritize their own projects so that all they have to do is delegate. Employees are often talked down to by management. Managers skip meetings and conference calls on a frequent basis with no warning. Meetings that employees set up with managers are often rescheduled frequently at the manager's will without any explanation. In other words, these meetings get put on the backbench because they're not as important to the employer as they are to the employee (which is sad). • Management is very disorganized and has a hard time implementing new ideas. New ideas and creativity is promoted and encouraged. However, very few new ideas are executed (and if so, executed very poorly) due lack of organization and the will power necessary to implement them. In other words, management has so many other departmental issues to take care of and fix (issues that have been disregarded or put on hold) that new ideas are forgotten or put on the backbench. • Lack of cross-training and training programs that are enforced by management.

Pervasive feeling of ""nothing is bad if it is good for Sysco"".",Sysco

1491,"""Mostly Politics, very little work""",1.0,Above market pay and excellent benefits. Very good hours. You will never be overworked.,There are professional meeting attenders in this company. A lot of politics and unnecessary paperwork. Be aware of what you are getting into. Smart people will be bored.,Sysco
1492,"""Better to be on the outside looking in than inside looking out.""",2.0,"The only good thing that comes to mind are the medical, dental, and vision benefits. The vision benefit is excellent, hence the designer frames seen throughout the company. For some employees the bonuses are very generous but if you are an average Joe Blow don't expect much of anything.","Large corporation run like a mom and pop, behind on technology, a lot of who you know not what you know, and DRUM ROLL...no cafeteria located in the corporate office. The largest food distributor in America doesn't believe in having a cafeteria for it's employees.",Sysco
1493,"""Hard work but well compensated""",5.0,"One thing a lot of people liked about SYSCO is they had good benefits. I only paid a few dollars a week for Vision, Dental, and $250k accidental death and dismemberment. (Sounds gruesome i know) Being a night shift selector, I made 17.95/hr which is real good for the area. Bonus was $0.03/case and I could pull about 7k per week. With overtime I grossed about 55k/yr.","It is HARD WORK as a selector. You cannot do it unless you are in great physical condition. In addition, 1 mistake an you lose the bonus. (understandable for high customer service) . Difficult temperature conditions. (0 degrees F to 85 degrees F).",Sysco
1494,"""Watch your back""",4.0,Large corporation with no money problems and great benefits,Tenure means nothing watch your back always,Sysco
1495,"""Depends on what you're looking for...""",3.0,"Fairly decent company to work for...foodbusiness is always tough. Get good exposure to a variety of suppliers and vendors, and learn a great deal about negotiating. As with every company, there's a lot of good people to work with, and a lot of contacts that I'll keep in touch with for a very long time.","Not a great work/life balance...company needs to ensure they pay enough to retain the best talent..not sure that's very dfferent at other companies. For the most part they look after their employees, and there's a fair amount of input, although from a budgeting perspective you don't get enough control over your numbers.",Sysco
