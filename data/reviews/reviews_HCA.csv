Affordable benefits PTO Set and Self Made Scheduling.","There is little to no room for moving up in pay or position without furthering your education and even then the pay increase is minimal compared to what you pay for schooling costs and time spent in schooling. Company focuses much more on RNs and LPNs with counselors (who must have 4 year degrees) being looked at as the bottom of the total pole...at a behavioral health hospital. I spend 12 hours a day in group and one-to-one situations with the patients, more than any other position in the hospital, and yet my opinion is the least valuable and most unwanted. The jobs of Mental Health Technician and Mental Health Counselor are exactly the same even though the descriptions of these jobs are not and the requirements are vastly different. If you think you will be at a desk or meeting with your patients in a relaxed situation you are wrong. The number one priority of the Mental Health Counselor is doing patient rounds, a very important job, where all you do is continually check on patients and make sure they are okay. It is very valuable, however this should be the job of the technician and takes away from time spent doing counseling, which is probably what you went to school for. You will be on your feet, running errands for patients, and being treated as a security guard and maid not only by the patients but also by members of your team. I can assure you there are rewarding features of the job but the overall feeling is that you do not matter other than to run and to keep the patients away from the nurses, unless they need them for medications. As far as staffing goes, we are always understaffed which makes for an unsafe environment for you, your team, and your patients. If this is the job you want be prepared to have more on your plate than is legally allowed almost every single day; unless the hospital is under inspection and then be prepared to have so much staff that you do not know what to do. It is false advertisement and creates a bitter team.",HCA Healthcare

It was a very toxic environment with the boss paging us all to the conference room - sometimes we would find out that someone was fired and sometimes we would find out that we got cake. We worked late hours but did not receive additional pay for extra hours worked and we do not utilize our counseling skillset at all. This is more of a job for a high school graduate than it would be for an LBSW or LMSW. They push you to work beyond your scope and put your license in jeopardy. Also a frequent refrain here from others was ""if you leave, they will treat you the same"". I can tell you firsthand that is not the case! As social workers, we need to advocate for ourselves and our unique set of skills. There are hospitals (mostly in Houston) that utilize us more appropriately (no case management and allow us to provide counseling - no DME, home health, etc.) During my time here, I honestly felt like a different person. Enduring such a toxic work environment spilled over into my personal life and I wasn't able to see the negative effects until I quit and went to a job with a healthy environment and supportive staff. Look elsewhere for a social work job - even if you go to another hospital in the area, chances are that you will be paid more even if you have to do case management (setting up home health, durable medical equipment like walkers/wheelchairs, faxing paperwork to companies, etc.) *Since Conroe Regional Medical Center is a hospital under the umbrella of HCA Healthcare and recently rebranded to be called HCA Healthcare Houston - Conroe, I am posting this review here and under the listing of Conroe Regional Medical Center.",HCA Healthcare

I cannot speak for the entire enterprise but I can say that their Corporate HR Organization is struggling. Speaking specifically to Talent Acquisition, the senior leaders have had numerous complaints filed with claims of discrimination but time and time again the individuals brave enough to say something wind up being silenced, fall victim to character assassination or wind up being pushed out of the organization. One senior leader is well known for screaming and throwing temper tantrums and stomping his feet in meetings when things do not go his way. This person once told me that “I just wasn’t smart enough to beat his score” while working on a team project. The rumors about HCA hospitals being dangerously under staffed remain true within the corporate lines of business, as well. I used to be the only person supporting my business function for all hospitals and Divisions. I now have the same job for a similar size business unit and have a team of 49 people to complete what I was once tasked to do alone in my role at HCA. Not to mention, I make 200% more than I did at HCA and I’m not belittled and marginalized while doing it. Recently since I left and brought some level of awareness to these toxic leaders, I’ve noticed a major uptick in their attempt to position themselves as an employer of choice for diversity and working moms.

I have worked in two HCA facilities and they both suffered the same lack of any sign of management skill. As if you needed one more, their proprietary medical records management software (Meditech) was created in 1969 and has not so much evolved as been continuously modified to create a Frankenstein monster of a software program (it runs in MS-DOS for crying out loud).

Management is more concerned about saving money than patient safety or employee satisfaction - consistently understaffed in every inpatient unit but plenty of middle management doing what, I don't know. Managers don't have a clinical background so don't understand - or even try to understand - what is really involved in delivering high-quality healthcare, they think it's just important to make as much money as possible. They will give lip service to placate any complaint or concern, either from staff or patients, and make no effort to improve or change anything at all. Unlicensed personnel are hired for and expected to be able to accomplish tasks that licensed professionals are specifically trained and LICENSED to do - and management thinks this is fine, as a few employees will try to overcompensate in the hopes of really being able to take care of their patients; this leads to burnout and high turnover in addition to patient and provider dissatisfaction. ""VIP"" patients are routinely given priority over others. There is also rampant racism endorsed by AND contributed to, if not actually propagated by, management, and bullying is not only ignored but rewarded. Also, pay doesn't take into account experience, loyalty, etc., and there is no vacation or sick time - they don't give you enough hours to work to make your pay check then take time out of your Paid Time Off to compensate for the difference, so you never accrue any real time off. Being flexed off three hours every week means you can't accrue enough time off to either take a proper vacation or conversely, get the flu; over the course of a year you may earn a fair amount of total PTO but you'll never be able to use it for anything other than saving HCA money one week at a time.",HCA Healthcare

Employees are worked to the point of burn out and disgust. If your facility very profitable, you may have a better experience, however if your facility happens to be the only one making profit in its region... staffing hours will be cut drastically in effort to save HCA as a whole money, regardless of your facilities' census, workload, or staffing needs.

Isolation of key members a key tactic But, oh, the daily mantras of inspirational motivation are sure to get you on track.. A pathetic excuse for a manager who struts and preens when riding on the works of the group, but the second something goes wrong in the office, there's a huge load in their panty. Then they start looking for someone to do a ""nappy"" change and cry about how hard everything is - Disgusting.. Management is through insults, intimidation, and bullying. Pretty much little rodents hired to be trained into big rodents, like the upper management. So called ""performance metrics"" are concocted to reflect whatever needs to be ""proven"". Basically, figures lie and liars figure. Your hours will be manipulated after being told something else. You will perform ""special projects"" for the incompetent rodent in management. You will be told one thing and it will never materialize.

No bonuses (even though the recruiter said I qualified), no raises (only a merit increase across the company at less than 2%), and promotions are non-existent. Micro-manage your time (nightly reports of completions/pending/and eta's), your time off, and even appointments you need to take. Absolutely NO differentiation between personal time and work time. They expect all of it. The work is easy, but the micro-management to do it specifically their way is so extreme they force you into this night and weekend work. No allowance to do things differently so you can get it done quicker, because they're unable to understand simple changes to their micro-managed structure. You're called apathetic if you're not excited to do the purposefully over-burdening workload exactly their way and on your nights and weekends. Actually yell about hours and threaten your job if you do not fall in line. Don't worry, though, management won't do anything about it. They'll actually re-enforce it. Talked to HR after I left, and they listened - but not one ounce of empathy or ""we will look into this"" or ""we do not accept this behavior."" Intimidating and hostile workplace.

They are too focused on suppressing nursing and do nothing for employee development. Our upper nursing management and nursing executives are loyal to the business side, not nursing interests. There is very little appreciation shown to the nursing staff. Over the years during Nurses Week they show appreciation by hosting degrading contests....crazy sock day, salsa contest day etc, then have the audacity to ask nurses during the same time to host a massive food drive for the San Antonio Food Bank, further demonstrating their expectations that nurses remain subservient to their own needs and showing the rest of the work force the same. This has been going on yearly since I started there 6 years ago. It's difficult to leave because the hospitals ""talk"" about nurses salaries. There is no incentive to leave and take another job elsewhere for higher pay because it doesn't exist. There have been several lawsuits in years past regarding ""price fixing salaries"". They don't follow the law. The state of Texas passed a law in 2011 that hospitals have a staffing committee comprised of staff nurses. To this day, Methodist Hospital does not have a committee as mandated by law. Although, I am not a union advocate, I think that this is the only way nursing at this HCA facility is going to progress forward. This facility is problem oriented and works on a day to day basis fixing the problems at hand. It is definitely not a visionary institution. I wouldn't recommend this facility as an employer for nursing. They are behind the times and nickel and dime every decision to their detriment.

Drugs cost a lot of money. 2. Pharmacists are in the best position to enforce the formulary. 3. If we have just enough pharmacists in the hospital to make sure really expensive drugs are not being used, we have great pharmacy services. Attempting to grow and expand services at the facility level is simply not allowed. Decisions in this regard are driven from the corporate office and are generally extremely short sighted. The onus placed on facility-level pharmacy is to do more with less. When the case is made that additional staff is needed, the answer is always ""no."" Small hospitals especially find themselves woefully under staffed; so much so that patient safety is compromised. The argument that deploying an adequate number of pharmacists to perform clinical work will improve patient outcomes thereby reducing total costs of care (which is well substantiated by evidence) is given no merit. The consistent theme that ideas originating from frontline staff are given no consideration is consistent throughout the company. Formulary decisions are also made based on short-sighted decision making. The basis of nearly all decisions is reduction of direct drug expenditures. No consideration is given to patient outcomes or evaluation of costs from a broader perspective. Certain medications are essentially banned from use due to their cost, regardless of whether their use would result in the best outcome for the patient. Whether a pharmacy department is managing their supply expense well is evaluated based on drug expense per adjusted patient day; a metric that in no way reflects whether drug purchases are appropriate for the patients receiving the drug. The metric is used simply because it gives the best estimate of income for the company. Thus, if expenditures per unit of income are minimized, a favorable profit margin can be ensured. In my time with the company, I have seen many decisions made that most would consider to be morally reprehensible. If you raise your concerns, you are considered to be a troublemaker. Individuals who simply keep their mouths shut and do what their told are held in high regard. This is especially true if you suck up to the right people. Administrators and other leaders will preach about ideals such as accountability and integrity; yet fail to exhibit these characteristics themselves. One would dare not share this observation, however; lest you be considered a problem employee. This is a prominent concept within HCA in general: a lot of talk and very little (if any) action. Finally, physician bullying is overlooked. Despite its detriment to patient safety, the fact that happy physicians make the company money is enough to convince administrators that there is no sense in addressing physician behavioral issues. The prospect of losing a physician's business is simply not worth the risk. With so many health systems developing increasingly innovative ways to deploy pharmacists to ensure patients are making the best use of the medications they are receiving, I cannot fathom a reason one would want to work for this company. That is, unless you prefer to be a complacent ""yes man"" in an extremely bureacratic environment.",HCA Healthcare
