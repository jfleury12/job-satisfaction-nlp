7,"""Nuclear Station Operator working at various sites throughout the company""",3.0,Tremendous training and preparation for the position. Qualifications don't lead to the next position.,"Too much regulatory oversight. Not much room for improvement, like working for the federal government.",Exelon
8,"""Great job security with a fortune 500 company and competitive benefits""",4.0,"For incoming new grad engineers, Exelon has a good rotation program. New grad hires get to move to a different department each month for 6 months. At the end of the rotations, your manager will ask what your top 3 preferred departments are. They will try to place you in one of these if there are openings and managers approve. Many engineering degree grads who are not electrical engineers do not think to apply to Exelon. However, electric power concepts are not difficult to pick up and many engineering tasks at the company can be learned on the job. They will hire people with industrial, manufacturing, civil, and mechanical engineering degrees for any engineering position out of school. I even know of someone being hired for an engineering position who had a mathematics degree. Don't get too comfy in your first job with the company. After 2 years in your first position, management generally ""recommends"" that you move to a different department. Exelon likes its employees to get an understanding of the company's various functions. Benefits include 401k with 5% match, employe stock purchase, BCBS PPO or BCBS High deductible HSA plan (HSA contribution of $500 per year HSA balances can be invested as well), Vision Plan, Aetna Dental plan. Bonuses for new hires are targeted for 7% of base salary depending on business unit performance, it can be higher or lower than that.","If you work in one of Exelon's utilities like PECO or ComEd then you are subject to work what is called Storm Duty. When you are on storm duty you are basically on call. If a severe storm or outage occurs during your storm duty you are called in to perform whatever function the company sees fit to assist in the restoration of service. This could be ""wire watching"" for downed wires, making reservations for field crews at hotels, dispatching field crews, etc. When you are called for storm duty you are expected to report in to your predetermined location within 1 hour. There are different storm teams that rotate duties throughout the year.",Exelon
9,"""Ok place to work, an over-emphasis on ""diversity""""",3.0,"Good co-workers, good manager, most strive for success for themselves and their peers. I would promote the workplace to friends to work at and say that it would be good place to be","Too much high end politics, too much ""diversity"" being pushed down and promoted instead of going for the better product/servicer/employee.",Exelon

14,"""Exelon IT review""",2.0,"Good salaries and benefits, flexible schedule, job for life","A lot of politics and little common sense or business strategy. Challenging status quo and innovation is discouraged. Leadership does not value domain or technical knowledge and often moves people to different position where they can't succeed.

Politics dominate and voicing a dissenting opinion is looked upon poorly. People manage up and your contact with your boss will be limited.",Exelon

Some managers permitted working from home and flexible hours.,"I only had one professional manager in the 15+ years I was there and he was moved to a non-management position. I didn't receive my 15% bonus one year because I ""missed meetings"", although no one could tell me what meetings I missed! HR felt that was OK. That was the same year my stepson was dying from cancer, my stepdaughter was getting married, and I wasn't permitted to take any vacation time. Fortunately that manager left.

38,"""Engineer""",5.0,Strong team of engineers and colleagues. Overall atmosphere was very helpful and inviting. The cafeteria was able to give out a lot of food,the office was far away from where i lived. Some people were not very smart and made the job difficult,Exelon
39,"""Glass Ceiling for Engineers""",2.0,Exelon seems to care about training yet you would think that when they invested money in an employee they would make an effort to retain them.,As you work at Exelon your pay raises decrease over time and you hit a glass ceiling especially for Engineers. Engineers with 10-30 years of experience are lumped in one category.,Exelon
40,"""Employer review""",3.0,"Coworkers very intelligent and easy going. It's a professional environment, however laid back.","Management, depending on the department, doesn't care about employees. For example, it is common in the Finance Department to work 10 hour days and weekends. Department managers are only interested in their careers and not their subbordinates (not all, but most). Some are blatant backstabbers and very egotistical. Many supervisors are simply incompetent.",Exelon
41,"""Corporate culture in Exelon.""",3.0,Management style. Respect. Customer oriented. Diversity.,Workload. No work life balance. Communication to the lower level.,Exelon
42,"""Internship Experience""",3.0,Worked at corporate headquarters as an IT intern. Received a very fulfilling project where I learned alot of new skills to complement what I have learned on campus.,Occasionally the full time employees were unwilling to help interns because they were buried in work themselves. Some interns were bored of lack of work.,Exelon
43,"""Nice company""",4.0,Exelon has comparable pay and offers a good work environment. This company cares about whether or not you are interested in what you do and will try to create opportunities for you to work on things that you like.,It is a very large company and sometimes you can feel that people aren't worried about you and sometimes might forget about you. The HR department is totally incompetent. They don't listen and don't use the information that they have. They probably provide more obstacles than help.,Exelon
44,"""Exelon compensates well however loses touch with recognizing its employees at the Sr. Level.""",4.0,"Exelon pays engineers very well. A Sr. Engineer can make between 60-110K. An Engineering Supervisor up to 135K. Every year we get b/w a 3-5% raise and our target bonus for a Sr. Engineer is 15%. You should get 15% if you are a solid performer and can get up to 5% more if you are a high performer. This bonus also takes into account station and overall company performanace. The benefits are also good. 3 weeks vacation, 401K (6% match), Cash Balance Pension Plan, 5 floating holidays, 6 sick days.",The work load is always demanding. Sufficient resources at the engineering level are never up to the necessary amount. Being on call can be stressful especially during an emergent activity.,Exelon
45,"""Exelon IT is the place to be.""",4.0,"I have had a really set of good bosses to work for in the 8 years I have been there, only 1 bad boss. My latest boss really stresses and helps ensure that the work life balance has been achieved. Pay is very good for the area and the field I am in. Vacation is also a definite plus. You need to enforce and embrace the safety conscious work environment at all of Exelon's Nuclear facilities. Safety, Security, and Training are very big parts of Exelon Nuclear. The Information Technology part of Exelon is definitely a good place to be.","You have to have a really good boss to work for to make the job enjoyable and you need to have drive and determination for your field. Exelon Nuclear Management really stresses and tries to ensure that the work life balance has been achieved. Pay is very good for the area but you need to be willing to put in the extra time and step up to the plate when you are needed. Vacation is also a definite plus, but you might have to sacrifice it from time to time for an urgent problem or project. You need to enforce and embrace the safety conscious work environment at all of Exelon's Nuclear facilities. Safety, Security, and Training are very big parts of Exelon Nuclear.",Exelon
46,"""Exelon, a leader of industry, burgeoning with oppurtunities - a place to start your professional career.""",4.0,"With a shift in focus to energy independence, non-fossil energy sources are becoming increasingly important. Exelon Corporation is at the forefront of utility companies by providing its customers with a diversified set of energy sources, solar, hydro, natural gas, and nuclear. It's a company that is very environmentally conscious, has a wide range of career oppurtunities, and is consistently growing.","There are downsides to any company and Exelon is no exception. Employees can be expected to work more than the standard work week (50hrs+, nights, weekends), however, these sacrifices don't go unrewarded. Employees are recognized through company awards, bonuses, and significant raises.",Exelon
47,"""Exelon: Simple Excellence in Employment""",5.0,"Exelon is a Fortune 150 company with a wealth of other accolades under its belt as far as employee treatment goes. They can boast several features in magazines, websites, and other noteworthy sources and proudly hold titles such as ""One of the best Companies with which to begin an IT Career."" Exelon's also a very diverse company, sporting copious talent from all walks of life and ensuring everyone has a chance to advance and move to big things. Additionally (and this is kind of an inside tip), fresh off of all their business deals and the merger between ComEd and PECO, Exelon is looking to bounce back from the hiring freeze caused by all that activity so they're not being TOO stringent on who they hire. They're also very employee satisfaction oriented...searching for new ideas and ways to make the lives of their current employees better as well as keeping an ear out for what attracts young new talent coming out of college. Plus, working with Exelon comes with many benefits: special types of bank accounts, discounts on some common and somewhat necessary goods and services, and more. As I've said, they treat their employees very well, and the pay is not bad at all either.","From an the standpoint of an IT employee...there's room for advancement and promotion within the company...lots of it, but Exelon's IT deployment is more utilitarian than anything. Not a lot of cutting edge, innovative stuff going on there, much of your work will go toward maintaining the current software and infrastructure or finding a new means to an end. If you want to do more design and innovation type things, then your best bet is to try to work for Corporate headquarters, based in Chicago.",Exelon
48,"""Exelon, we only care about the stockholder""",2.0,"The benefits, clean work environment.","Management get treated poorly, they put in allot of hours and get nothing. Exelon is onlyworried about making megawatts instead of fixing problems until they have to. They have all their rules. procedures which they preach, but when a job can't be done because of their rules or procedure, they want you to just ""wing it"".",Exelon
49,"""Exelon - Nuclear""",2.0,the pay is a lot higher than what you would receive in similar careers,being on call on 24 hours a day (weekends & holidays included); the staff is spread to thin to,Exelon
50,"""Best Opportunity Ever""",5.0,"This company is a growing leader in the Energy industry, with a forward thinking vision. Amazing compensation packages (Salary and Benefits). I have spoken with everyone I know about my work experiences at Exelon; and I can confidently say that this company is dedicated to the cultivation of it employees. Constant training and advancement opportunities. Rewarding job full of challenges where I am given an opportunity to excell without fear of failure. Management is constantly trained on new methods to keep the workforce engaged, rewarded, and happy. Despite my junior level, I am allowed and expected to function on a high level where by I am given a great deal of responsibility. I will probably work here for 20-30 years.","Not much to say here: The changing economy makes some long term focus changes within upper management trickle down upon middle management a little uneasily. This company is a little top heavy (a few too many Directors, VPs, Senior VPs, etc...) We are expected to perform at a higher level of excellence everyday, eventhough the workforce is slowly being down sized. This presents a challenge, but is in no way un-manageable. I personally like it this way, as it caters to my slight superman complex, but many can be turned off by this. I welcome the challenge to change the way I do business to make each task easier, thus leaving myself in charge of making my job easier.",Exelon
51,"""Great opportunity""",5.0,"All of my managers were incredibly helpful in getting me started with the company. I was given a job to do and shown how to do it, and then I was left alone to get it done. That being said though, I was also able to get a hold of my manager if I needed clarification.","Some of the people in my group who had been there a bit longer than I had would complain about the upper management. I had no issues personally, but I guess there is some amount of discontent.",Exelon
52,"""Only Workaholics Need Apply""",1.0,"Generally kind people, clean work space, potential to review other jobs within the organization, good benefits, opportunity to visit other sites in addition to 'home base' departments.","This company is perfect for the employee that wants to be a 'corporate slave', or that wants to be glued to their blackberry on vacations, weekends, nights, during your commute.... There is a lot of discussion regarding WLB (Work Life Balance), and it is promised during the interview process. What is not mentioned is that if you actually do request a WLB, it is both highly frowned upon -although no one will tell you this, they will just talk about you behind your back, and expected that you will still be working your full day-although you're not in the office. 10+ hour days are expected regardless of department or job, everything from craft employees up to Sr. Mgmt and everyone in between. Another problem is the finger pointing and lack of ownership. As a power company, everything is very highly monitored, regulated, and tracked (which is wonderful!). The problem comes in when employees do not stand up for their own actions or lack of action, errors, or whatever the problem may be. There are many people that are so overloaded that they push their work load onto others, which just causes work-stress, and even worse results. Middle management does not recognize work load allocation, problems within their own team, or if they do, a blind eye is turned. If I had to summarize, Exelon pays fairly, has good benefits, and believes in employee and community safety. My position afforded me the opportunity to talk with all different departments and levels within the organization. When I asked the question ""How do you like working for Exelon,"" the answer was always the same....""They pay is good, but money isn't everything if you can't enjoy it and you're always here. Middle and upper management needs to realize the work loads of my/our/the team and play fair.""",Exelon

I survived three unsuccessful mergers which resulted in reorganizations and we were expected to do more with less. Little to no regard for employee feedback and contributions. Our contributions were not acknowledged or respected at the Corporate Center.,Exelon
56,"""Big utility company""",3.0,Exelon is a leader in the utility business and offers great benefits. You learn very quickly of how to work within a large top-down bureaucracy.,"Opinions of middle and lower management typically are not valued, and as such, the company is slow to react to the demand side of their customers.",Exelon
