563,"""2019 Reorganization layoffs""",3.0,"The biggest pro's to working at Best Buy is the employee discounts and accommodations. I do PC gaming, console gaming, PC building, Photography, videography, digital art, and I love my home audio, TV's, smart watches, and my lady loves her small and large appliances. Why does this matter? Because I've saved thousands of dollars with the discounts on all of that stuff, especially the accessories and anything that's a Best Buy brand. I even saved a 4 thousand dollars on a new Ford Fusion car with an accommodation because Best Buy and Ford have a partnership. When I got laid off I made a list of things I needed to buy before I no longer had a discount, things like printing paper, batteries, home audio cables, network cables, paper shredder, new printer..etc. price went from $1300 down to $500. Another pro is time off if you are a full time employee. States vary, I am specifically talking about CA. The longer you work at Best Buy the more time off you acquire per week, at over 4 years I think I was getting 3 hours of vacation time a week. So about every 3 months I would have a around 40 hours of paid vacation. I was able to go on vacation all of the time, what's nice is management will generally always approve your vacation. in my 5 years of working I was never denied. The only blackout dates are around black Friday and Christmas. You also get paid holidays and if you work you get time and a half. So technically if you work a holiday you're getting double time and a half pay. California also gives workers a mandatory 40 hours of paid sick time off so, things were good. Not really a pro, more neutral, starting pay is usually above minimum wage but only by a dollar or so, this is made up by the employee discount. If you don't plan on buying anything and would rather get paid more I would look at other places like Trader Joes or Costco if you want to stay in retail. Depending on the store you work at, the best buy team is usually fun. You are surrounded by people who love technology and video games just like you do, usually the stores have monthly BBQ's, Gaming nights like smash tournaments, and managers have their own get together's like bowling nights and other stuff like Christmas gift exchange dinners.","Time for Cons. 2019 the company laid off thousands of employees, I was one of them, the process was completely unorganized and I didn't get paid for over 2 months. Management can be unfair and dishonest. My store there was favoritism, discrimination, and some shady stuff going on between male managers and line level female employees. These issues create a toxic environment that makes you dread coming to work. The constant micro-managing that line level employees and team leaders get from upper management get every single day is exhausting. You will have multiple metrics and sales goals to keep track of and meet every day and every month. daily check-ins/outs and daily, weekly, and monthly coachings, trainings, and e-learnings. The radio in your ear will tell you that you need to get more credit apps, TTS, and more revenue continuously throughout the day, not to mention in person every time a manager walks by. ""You only have 1 app out, you need to offer it 100% of the time"", ""I have been, I've only had 2 customers"", ""If you only had 2 customers then you're not seeking them out, you need to go find customers and get some more apps"", ""But i'm the only one in the department"", ""That's fine, we will keep a watch"" ....2 min later... ""Hey where are you at, we need you back in your department, there's customers back here and no one to help them! Don't forget to offer financing."" The last con, little room to move up. There was a lot of people I knew who put the time in and got no where, not even a pay raise. Management positions rarely open and when they do its favoritism most of time. I saw them hire 3 managers before I was laid off. All 3 of them knew nothing of their new positions and the people who interviewed against them where better qualified, more knowledge, and better leaders in my opinion...but in the end, favoritism wins. They will open the position for the minimum required time to do interviews but like I said, most of the time they already know who they are hiring, they just do interviews because they legally have to.",Best Buy

They recently changed the bonus structure. They framed it as they were going to make the budgets easier, but made the different tiers of bonuses higher. That was a lie. Budgets did not change, but they sure did make it harder to hit the bonus. Took a 30% pay cut year over year just because of that, which was a big part in why I decided to leave. That combined with the lack of upward mobility as well. The company is one giant good ol' boys club. It isn't really what you know but who you know. If you are not in the club, there is a limit to what you can do within the company. I have seen them move mountains to give jobs to people that didn't deserve it because they were in the club. Also, if you are not in the club and upset someone that is in the club, prepare to watch your career get destroyed.

694,"""Good stepping stone into customer service, sales, and IT.""",3.0,"Because of the nature of Geek Squad, turnover is relatively high, I theorize that this is because any person who has the skills to success at Geek Squad, whether it be on the sales side or the technical side, will quickly see that they're skills can earn them far greater money if applied somewhere else. I myself made it 6 months working as a Consultation Agent (a fancy title for a non-commission salesman masquerading as a desktop technician) before being poached to go work for a company that dealt with IT/networking for businesses. Had I not been headhunted away from the Consultation position, I would have quickly looked to move into the coveted ""Advanced Repair Agent"" (ARA for short) position, as this position is far more likely to be full time with benefits as opposed to the part time C.A. position I had, and if not, I would have been looking to move into business desktop support roles. Anyway, this is the pros section. Pros: Relatively easy to get hired if you know even 10% more about computers than your average American. Environment is relatively low stress, despite being fast-paced enough to easily make the 4 hour shifts fly by and the 8 hours shifts move along steadily. You get to work with an assortment of consumer technology, for whatever that's worth. Employee discount decent for certain items. No worries about parking. If you're a young adult with an interest in computers and technology, I doubt there's many other retail outlets where you will be as surrounded by similarly-minded people. Good practice ground for any aspiring IT technician to get familiar with the essential art of translating end-user speak into technical speak. Good practice ground for aspiring salespeople to try their hand at selling a product thats worth selling (Total Tech Support). Opportunity to troubleshoot interesting issues. This mainly applied to myself, as I was so vastly overqualified for the consultation role that the repair techs would come to me when they had an issue that stumped them on client computers. I'm not saying this pompously, the leadership realized my skill and actually had me come in several hours early on numerous perform duties of the ARA position, albeit without any of the additional compensation.","While this is anecdotal, my biggest grievance came when one, out of the store's two, full-time Consultation Agents moved on to better things (you guessed it, business desktop support), and instead of making moves to put the best salesmen at the time (me) into that full time slot, the penny-pinchers in charge decided that they would rather hire about 6 part-timers. Of course, this is when I saw the writing on the wall as far as how advancement opportunities were handled. Another con would be lack of marketing/awareness campaigns as to what geek squad's scope actually is. Each day presented a Geek Squad worker a different scenario as to which they would have to delicately explain how (insert request here) was not something GS did. Goofing off, or the appearance of doing so, was not tolerated for those in the Consultation Agent position. If you were an ARA, safe in the back of the ""precinct"" (yea theyre still doing the police theme), you were free to chitchat and listen to music with your fellow ARAs to your hearts content. Likewise, if you're a ""blueshirt"" aka a normal bestbuy worker, go ahead and stand around waiting for customers all day, the rules pertaining to appearing busy at all times dont apply. Only the CA;s seemed to be expected to be actively working on something 100% of the time. The pay wasn't much to brag about. In-and-Out in the same area as the best buy I was at paid only slightly lower to start. Silly and insulting anti-union videos were a part of the mandatory training materials. For part-timers, compensation is a dollar amount and nothing more, practically speaking. The computer monitors that the CA's had to use for completing appointments were actually low-quality Dynex (bestbuy brand) tv screens. This, combined with the archaic web applications required to complete the job duties, caused me such immense eye-strain that I was basically forced to obtain blue-light filtering prescription glasses. The web application for entering PC related work requests worked well enough for how cludgy it was, but the repetition and boredom brought about from doing apple appointments, which required filling out forms on both Apples GSX website as well as BestBuy's system, was enough to have me considering walking right across the street and applying to become a car salesman. Its obvious why Best Buy/Geek Squad does not use a commission-based approach to rewarding the sales employees, but there needs to be something to encourage the employees forced to use medium-pressure sales tactics to push Total Tech Support to actually work for sales. The mysterious bonus structure (which I not once benefited from) is simply not a good way of encouraging performance.",Best Buy

You can be the star of the store one day if you’ve made thousands of dollars worth of sales but the next day made feel small if you don’t reach that goal.

If you're thinking about applying, go ahead and get off here and apply. Its not that big of a deal to be on here. It is a name brand job on your resume, a OK discount system. It is a SECURE job. Very secure. If you have a good leader they will teach you so much.","Cons depend on your Management/Supervisory Team and your directly reporting leader, rather than the job itself. This is not a bad job by nature. It is a good job by nature. Cons depend on the location, the location's current struggles at this job. If a certain market initiative is a priority, a badly calibrated manager will constantly be repeating this over and over and over and over and over again. It's never rude, though. But it ends up being so obnoxious that at times, you almost wish they would just be rude. Lol. In this example, they may also ask ""where's those credit cards hahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah"" and if this is going on a lot, the cringe can make you want to go play in traffic. Or, if your own location is doing badly in a category, they will summon weekend trainings. If they are doing badly in many categories, there will be ...weekend trainings for.... all the bad things, making it inescapable to be there for one thing or the other thing, if that is happening. And, staffing is not as prevalent as it used to be so you cover a lot of floor when it's busy - but when it's slow, and nobody is shopping it's agonizingly boring for a long time. You think that would be cool, but you can only BS so long before you run out of BS to do and then you actually begin to do the BS parts of your job because you are just that bored in those times. Then it gets busy and the manager, if they aren't that good at this yet, starts freaking out and pointing out where to go. Then they run the other direction, so they can continue doing nothing, just like you were, during the previous pause in traffic. lol Speaking of that, leadership positions are not in strong supply anymore, so if you want to move up, you'd better wait until someone else transfers out of their position (they won't because there aren't any positions to transfer into) or rarely, gets terminate, or voluntarily steps down, usually for a oopsie they did to themselves.",Best Buy

Sometime have accommodation offers from manufactures for different items.,"Store 123 has run so many people out of there that it's embarrassing. We're talking good employees too who have been with the company for years, people who have gone on to thrive at different locations, the few who actually stayed with Best Buy anyways. The people in charge just bark at you and never says a kind word or really even interact with you like a normal person would. Unless your an attractive woman, then you get plenty of ""attention"". I have no idea how this location hasn't imploded; HR complaints, how it's run, the way people are treated, both who work there and customers. Speaking of HR it seemed like a frat house at times with relationships. These people were hooking up, this person was sending out nude photos, they were making inappropriate comments. I heard one person had their own folder of complaints. A folder! But they were still working for Best Buy. There is a lot of pressure to sell services. Geek Squad Protection, Total Tech, Progressive Leasing, and Lord help you if you don't run enough credit card apps. I enjoyed helping someone get the product they needed and if they felt one or more of the services were a good fit for them, but it felt like I had to force it on them to keep up numbers and what I was really selling them a was future of debt. But I guess that's a problem for Citi Card debt collectors and not Best Buy. In addition of services you will get real familiar with their Matrix system. Your tracked on a variety of numbers; total revenue, transactions per hour, percentages of a multitude of things. People would check out their numbers hourly. Store 123 is in a bad location. There are homeless people who ask you for money in the parking lot. There have been shootings and stabbings in the area. Syringes have been found in the bathrooms. It's a hard place to feel safe. If your dead set at working at Best Buy, avoid 123. You would do a lot better at one of the other stores, physically, mentally, and professionally. I avoid this location even for just shopping and tell my friends and family to do the same.",Best Buy

However, someone who was a poor overall salesperson could have one big ticket item sale and hit budget while a good performer could have dozens of full basket/solution sales and still be in the negative. The full basket solutions were much more profitable but was not focused on. Furthermore, the ASM (In my opinion promoted too early) was and still is trying to change the store sales tactic from helping the customer, which it should be, to shoving unneeded and unwanted products and services down the customers' throats.

1566,"""Worst Job environment I Have ever been in""",3.0,"Very easy job, and meh benefits.","-Worst Training I have ever taking They throw you on computer without any mentoring for like weeks and you gotta do those tedious E-learnings(Training modules) which is the worst E-learningsI have ever taken. Why you ask? because most of them (the 60 i took) are very useless and redundant information, and it takes years to good to the point or even the thing they should have said in e-learnings in beginning. You don't even learn sale(WUSA method) until like the end of the training and it is only TWO modules out of the tens of e-learnings modules you do and that is the most useful information other than learning to shove best buy credit card and Geek Squad Protection at every customer comes even if they buying a ten dollar cable(I'm serious). In the end only 10% of the e-learnings that matter, and you actually going to use in store. - Lets talk about scheduling. The manager (not supervisor) will make the schedules for employees not only for one department, but the whole store; Which makes it worst scheduling system I've ever encountered. It is super inconsistent, like very inconsistent. They won't tell you that in interview, and they make it around your availability which when you apply they ask for your availability which they still manage to mess up. even if you are full time 40 hours a week employee they would mess up your schedule. Sometimes you get weeks that you literally work only 1-2 days a week (if you are part time) and at the end of the pay cycle you got only 18-24 hours those two weeks. even if you full time you are very lucky five days a week work. Some days I worked there were only literally only one employee in the whole department which was last week for me. Also scheduling not only messed up in terms of assigning you days, but assigning you hours per day. Sometimes you get from 9am-3pm and sometimes 11am to 5pm, and sometimes 2pm to 7pm. It is like almost the schedule was randomly generated. - Now paying. You'll get paid less than 14/hr for sure no matter how ambitious or talented you are. It is not even competitive which they say during their application. At the pay cycle you will be always disappointed no matter how much you think you worked. Like some weeks you almost think you worked full time but nope! here is 300-400 doller. On top of that they expect you tell sell One thousand doller per hour or you get the 1on1 or demoted, or terminated. Some employee literally sell 10k per shift in total and you don't even get commission because it is worst since they push you so hard to hit 1k per hour and on top of 1k per hour sell credit cards, and geek squad protection per shift. So they not only under paying you, they are over working you. - In my store (I heard other stores are better so depends)there was employee bullying and toxic masculinity. Actually tons of ego and toxic of masculinity because I worked at computer department and they all think they are godly at computers and complain and talk behind customers back and bad talk them behind their backs. Also in my workplace there was tons of drama going on between employees and managers. When I was training employees looked down on me and shove me around like a dog honestly, and I didn't like that. They call it mentoring which it isn't. I always try to stay away from the drama and toxic employees as much as possible which there will be time where you gonna run into it and deal with it or be looked down on.",Best Buy

1634,"""Sinking Ship Syndrome""",1.0,It's better than living on the street if you can't find a better job.,"Dishonest, unethical, and illegal business practices. Misrepresented employee benefits. In 2016, Best Buy began requiring all new employees to sign an arbitration agreement as a condition of employment, and forced then-current employees to sign the arbitration agreement or face immediate termination. Managers told employees that it was just some legal jargon that didn't matter and that they didn't need to read it, should just sign it, and it wouldn't have any affect on them, which is criminally dishonest. Managers are enabled and even implicitly encouraged to misrepresent losses in order to keep P&amp;L reports above a certain threshold. Inventory as significant as $4000 appliances are reported as in-store when they have been lost to theft or misdelivery as much as one year prior, and these items add up to millions of dollars of losses that are not being reported to financial investors who have a right to know the status of the business's assets. When missing inventory reaches a tipping point at a given store, they simply close that store and move the products around, hiding the losses in the shakeup. This results in layoffs for staff and promotions for the managers that created the problem. Insurance options are insulting, and a plan with adequate coverage for a healthy adult easily accounts for a third of total salary. The corporate culture encourages staff to blame ""Obamacare"" for this, but I had better coverage in both the job I held prior to working for Best Buy and the one I went to following. Staff are explicitly told not to engage in any conversations about unionization, and to report any talk of unionization immediately. They are threatened with reduced wages and store closures in the event of unionization, and even required to take an online anti-unionization propaganda course. It is likely that Best Buy is in violation of labor laws in these practices, but they do not seem concerned. These things began only after arbitration agreements were signed. Least significant, except for the fact that all other benefits are paltry, the employee discount is misrepresented, even as it is heavily advertised as a reason to consider employment with the company. Employees and prospective employees are told that they can purchase any product for 5% above cost, save for very explicit exceptions including Apple products, game consoles, and software. Most staff do not have access to actual cost data, except for certain managers and the SWAT Specialist. I can report from personal observation that many products which should have been discounted for staff were sold to staff at no or very little discount. Items were sometimes sold to staff at 200% of cost. There was no explanation for this. At the same time, some obscure products were discounted to below cost, such a USB-C cable which retailed for $25, showed a cost of $3, and an employee price of $0.20. A pre-paid mobile phone which retailed for $40 and cost $22 was discounted to $4. These were likely errors, but I believe they stemmed from the fact that cost data was knowingly entered into the inventory system inaccurately in order to prevent employees from realizing they were not receiving discounts as promised. Sales staff are given quotas for credit card applications that cross the line well into the realm of predatory. Employees are punished for not having enough applications, and I observed at least one employee who would initiate credit applications for customers without their consent. I reported this to a manager who said they couldn't do anything about it, and this employee continued to be lauded month after month for exceeding sales goals, to the point that she was given a free expenses-paid vacation. It was not uncommon to have a customer come in and say they received a credit card in the mail that they had not applied for. This is definitely illegal, yet it was encouraged. I worked at Blockbuster many years ago, shortly before they began closing stores. They engaged in similar practices. These are the sorts of things companies do out of desperation in order to keep investors happy, before they eventually collapse. I would strongly advise against taking a job at Best Buy now, and if you already work there, I recommend you begin looking for another job now, rather than wait until you are forced to do so.",Best Buy

1958,"""Seasonal Sales Consultant""",4.0,"If you’re a student in high school or college, this can be a good place to work if you want to make a little more than minimum wage. The job is indoors and really just involves talking to people every day. You don’t need as much technical knowledge as you’d think because that can be taught to you while you’re training. Every day has different challenges, and good employees really can distinguish themselves and move up. The option to work full time and receive benefits and bonuses also exists, but don’t be surprised if they start you out seasonal as this is how most people I worked with started out. If it’s the right season you’ll get as many hours as you want, and they may increase you to full time if you perform well. The CEO and their business model are solid, and this seems like one of the better companies to work for in retail. The people I worked with were some of the nicest people I’ve ever met, and they even made the bad days good. You will be thoroughly trained.","You are not entirely in control of whether or not you hit your own goals because there will be days when there just aren’t a lot of people looking to buy your product. This is usually made up on busier days like weekends, but it is still a con because it can hurt you even when you do things right. The closing shift is scheduled to work until a half hour after the store closes, but we were almost always there much longer. This was improved upon recently but still remains an issue — especially around holidays. If the store closes at 1am on Thanksgiving expect to be closing until 3:30am and then show back up tomorrow morning for Black Friday. This is especially annoying because most frustration with this could be avoided by adjusting the schedule. Expect to be on your feet all shift, up to eight hours (except for a lunch break up to a half hour). Everyone has to be available to work on weekends and some holidays. Shifts are a minimum of 4 hours, which can make scheduling difficult for students. I was told that conversations, especially regarding store cards, geek squad protection, and other core items, should be natural and never forceful to the customer when being trained by managers. However, the same managers would often reprimand me when I wasn’t forceful. (I.e. make people say no to GSP three times before you stop asking, among other too-forceful practices.) It really can make you feel like a sleazy salesman some days.",Best Buy

I know people who keep working part time just to keep their discount.,"Every store is its own little kingdom so you very easily end up working at a store that has a well deserved bad reputation in the area. The pay is way too low and it's usually pretty hard to get much of a raise beyond a few cents unless you make management or can really talk your manager into arguing with district staff for you.

Best Buy credit cards are pushed way to hard, there are some very shady practices to get people to sign up. Some managers will tell you to say your credit won't get dinged if you apply for a credit card. They will push you to get people to apply for credit cards for a $5 dollar purchases, they will tell you to lie about getting 10% off your first purchase when in reality you get 10% in rewards credit. They push saying employee aren't commissioned base in reality if you sign a lot of people up or get them to purchase geek squad protection or total tech support, they will get some sort of kick back.

You are putting that blue shirt on to make money for the machine. You can't really get sick, have car trouble, have a family emergency safely without getting in trouble of some kind. Their motto for this year was ""be human"" but that obviously does not apply to their employees. For example I was with this company for 4.5 years and when I left... nothing. No card. No kind words, Nothing. In fact they were petty enough for me taking a better job they cut all my hours I was planning to work in my 2 week notice without telling me keeping me from starting my next job sooner. If you want a ""family"" work environment this is not the job for you. If you want to come to work and make average money at BEST but have lots of fun toys to buy this is a good job for you.
