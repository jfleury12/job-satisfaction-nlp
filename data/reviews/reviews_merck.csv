R&amp;D is harder and more expensive, 2. the public and most levels of government generally do not understand the complexity of healthcare at all and mostly think by simply passing a single piece of legislation all of healthcare's issues will be resolved (targeting pharmaceuticals), 3. access to providers is 4x harder than it was 10 years ago, and 4. the med-legal red tape just keeps getting deeper.

This unfortunately results in many people who have not learned new skills and seem to be unmotivated to change themselves or their workstreams, which resulted in industry best-practices not being followed. It honestly felt like people at Merck operated in a bubble that was 15 years behind in digital marketing (saying this even taking into consideration legal pharma issues). I found it was nearly impossible to move anything forward in an environment where there is so much bureaucracy, hierarchy, politics, and sensitivity. Co-workers often seemed to justify their jobs by strangle-holding their workstreams instead of collaborating openly and without ego. It often feels like everyone is trying as hard as possible to not do anything, but still trying to appear as if they are doing something. The feeling of obfuscation is overwhelming. The physical building culture is also not ideal - in an era where many offices are going remote, the Merck UG campus building remains something straight out of Office Space.",Merck
114,"""7 Years at Merck""",3.0,"A lot of opportunity - I'm a chemical engineer in manufacturing. I've been fortunate enough to work on 5 unique processes in 7 years (both locally and internationally), and learn from some very bright people. Competitive salaries and benefits, retirement retirement benefit specifically is better than competitive. The 401k would be decent on its own, and there is a pension on top of it. Work-life balance is great in some departments Ethical culture. Focus on serving patients (at least in manufacturing - I'm not in the rooms where they decide what we're going to charge for our products).","VERY VERY bureaucratic. Not sure why senior management thinks that the solution to every problem is to create a new system with a complex approval process. And this bureaucratic culture is not just related to regulatory compliance (where bureaucracy is a given) . In at least one case there is a business approval process you need to follow before you are allowed to move on and then follow the compliance approval process (which includes another business approval). The bureaucracy permeates every aspect of live at Merck. A very conservative company. The first , second, and third instincts are to do it the way we've always done it. I don't think Merck is a place to go if you want to trail blaze. In most aspects of science and technology, Merck is 5-10 years behind. For example we just figured out monoclonal antibodies a few years ago (while everyone else was adopting them in the 90's). Very silo-ed company. Different organizations are evaluated against very different criteria. Different departments all have their own agendas. It makes forming truly collaborative and cross functional teams difficult. Work-life balance is not always great. I listed this as a pro too as it very's by department. I've had 4 distinct rolls at the company. 2 were predominantly low stress with roughly 40hr work weeks. The other 2 were much worse. Under 50hrs was a good week, 60+ was frequent. Pressure from management can become intense, and when projects are managed badly the first thing to get sacrificed is always the private lives and well being of those at the bottom of the org structure. The sacrifice is not always rewarded either. There is a bit of perverse incentive in the way the company handles it's best employees. When you are identified as an ambitions and talented employee you are usually sent off to work on projects that have fallen behind - the idea being you can ride over the hill on a white horse and save the project. The problem is that those projects usually fall behind because they have bad management and bad cultures (i.e. not because of problems one person can step in fix no matter how talented they are), or just because they're ""behind"" goals that were never realistic in the first place. Being sent off to those projects is not exactly a reward worth working hard for. Top down decision making, thus decision makers are out of touch with the the actual consequences of their decision (a problem that I'm sure most large companies have) Health benefits are a little below average",Merck

Also, despite allowing employees community time, they are intentional about not being visible as Merck; they support no local causes in the communities they work and serve. Employee involvement in outside organizations is not to be shared in office, even though certain leadership members hawk Girl Scout cookies on site so that his/her team can show their appropriate support and purchase them. They are not employee communication focused; management says what you should tell, and ask about. This creates huge circles of secrecy, stunting of creativity, unwillingness of idea creation and 'facades' of innovation, at best. They are 127 years old, and really don't know or want to deviate from 'this is how we've always done it'. And that is from the top to bottom.

I brought this to the attention of my manager, and what bothered me the most was indifference.

New department leadership that seem to have things moving in the right direction. Positive outlook on future opportunities and movement within Merck-Wilson. Not right now though. The year end bonus is very consistent as long as you don't get in the bottom range of the peers for the year end review. You know what you will get for the most part.","At this time, there is not a lot of opportunity for advancement within Merck-Wilson. It's looking better but not there. Often management will hire from outside when there are capable and qualified internal candidates. Medical benefits have taken a huge decline over the last 2 years. The employee cost continues to rise as well as deductibles while the benefits and coverage are much less. Prescription drug coverage also have declined over the past several years. Same as above. Year end raises are typically around 2% at best for employee that meet expectations. Some will get up to 4.5% if they are top performers but that is a very few number of people. The year end bonus is consistent as stated above, but even if you have a very good year the individual contributor effect on the bonus is small. Meaning that you will receive the close to your median bonus no matter how you perform. Unless you are a top performer. That seems to make a substantial difference. Note that top performers are very few. The end of year review is on a bell curve. Meaning that if there are 2 top performers in your level, then there have to be 2 bottom performers (even if the 2 put in the bottom did a good job). This makes no sense to me and demoralizes the workforce to a point. In the past, Merck wanted to be head and shoulders above the other companies in the area as far as pay and benefits. Now they seem happy with status quo and have reduced benefits and target salaries to be in the 50th percentile. There is a tremendous workload for the number of employees in the Quality department. It is often very difficult to get it all done in a day or work week. This could be looked at as job security or not.. Note that this has gotten better over the last year. Addition to above note.

Example, the performance evaluation program (determines next year's pay increases and bonuses) would be comparable to gladiators in a ring. Whoever is left standing is the victor. Those who are perceived to have the most value are rewarded according to a differentiation scale which managers/directors have to battle it out in a differentiation meeting. Example 25% of employees will be received high rating, 50% receive average, and 25% receive low rating. Employees could be rated in the lowest 5-10% performance category even though they met all their performance goals and objectives because there is a limited number of positions available to fit in the higher categories. The company conducts annual employee surveys where the employees give their opinion and feed back on management, their perception of the company, how they feel about their work environment etc. The final overall company rating is linked to employee compensation. Basically, if employees give a 75% rating then they get 75% of the target bonus. If the rating is 25%, then they get 25% of their target bonus. The better rating you give, the more of the target bonus is given. The worse the rating, the less the target bonus is given. Unprofessional behavior by some managers and directors such as belittling and yelling at their subordinates in front of other colleagues is looked over. This is largely due that there is no longer a visible HR presence. In past years, HR was a building away. Now, you have to call a toll free number to reach a benefit service center to discuss HR matters. The other pathway is to express your concerns about your management thru 360 feedback on your management.

People in this industry love litigation, so everything about this industry involves awareness of countless state and federal laws. Along with the lackluster financial results, the corporate culture has taken a beating. Unfortunately, it's become a routine expectation for a wave of layoffs to occur every 18-24 months which impairs employee loyalty. Consequently, I'd estimate at least 50% of employees are looking around for other opportunities. I'd only consider working at Merck if you're absolutely passionate about a particular job opportunity here or just want ""Merck"" on your resume.

So it was a great opportunity to learn about the pharmaceutical industry. They have the latest technology and information. I never appreciated how Merck was up to date with their technology and competitive with their way of working until I started at another company and we had to use forms to fill out EM. When i left Merck, I stayed in contact with a several people and I realized how small of an industry this is. I met some of the greatest people out there who I became great friends with and sometimes I wish there are more people like that every where else. I truly miss them now that I'm at a different job. Those people could never be replaced. Merck gives all the learning tools for you there, it's up to you to learn them or be like 80% of the people there and just go with the flow. Learn all that you can, don't be shy and ask questions. I am more experienced because I was at Merck. Great pay!!!","This West Point site is union and it was very tough. You have to have a very thick skin (or grow a very thick skin) to survive. Now you will meet your friends for life there, and you will meet some of the most horrible human being alive there. This is your typical corporate America, where they hire in numbers and layoffs in numbers. in recent years there have been many layoffs, and there are always high turn over rates. When I was there, my department could not keep people long enough. We were always training new people, ALWAYS. We were under staffed and there were plenty of over time. Now due to cut backs, my old co-workers tell me that they are still understaffed but over worked on their shift, overtime has been cut, and so has supervisors. It was hard to move around to new jobs and opportunities. Some of the smartest people that I knew never got promoted or change roles because of job freezes and blocking movements. I hated every day that I was there during my last 2 years. I hated my department management because they hired pretty much baby-sitters who knew nothing about the process, my associate director got his job because he was buddies (boys club) with the other guys running the show in Rota, I hated the union group there because I was always peered pressure to never complain to HR about how other union employees with more seniority was treating me. One incident, a more senior employee said during shift change that I it does not matter if I'm pregnant, I am getting paid so I should be lifting heavy cans just like her. It's not her fault that I'm pregnant and that I shouldn't be treated with special treatment. I reported it to HR as a harassment. The next day, several union along with the shop Stewart told me to re-track my claim or else the next time i need the union to back me, I will be on my own. Since I was low seniority at one point, I was drafted to work double shift. there were many times when I raised the issue that I it's not safe to let me know at least a shift ahead of mine that I have to work a double. The resolution was to under staff the shift. My friend, after being drafted to work double shifts every day from 3 month (like 7 days a week for 12 weeks) was so tired, she fell asleep in the break room and got discipline for that. I couldn't stay one day because there was no one to take care of my kids at home. When I came in the next day I was disciplined for leaving. There is a well define line about how the union and company people were treated. Company employees got support for health and medical life.

Poorly executed third party outsourcing with people unskilled in the continuous management of the newly developed business processes that were put in place once the initiation project team disappeared. Merck is (though shrinking) such a large organization. Its nearly impossible to steer the ship. So many fragmentation of lines of responsibility. There is a well planned process for moving a molecule from research/discovery through development and commercialization. All other interfaces and business processes in support of this primary process remain ad hoc, poorly developed, having been subject to too many changes over the years and not well respected or understood by those who identify themselves to be directly in the process of 'supporting the pipeline'. Still waiting on C-levels to understand this. In the West Point and possibly New Jersey sites, some longterm (15 years+) employees cant be brought to stop mourning the 'good old days.' They demonstrate this with great love of their old bureaucratic ways and resistance to any improvement. I get it that there has been great change, and that regulated groups in particular need to have some rigidity in their processes to ensure compliance. However, an attitude of being closed minded to gathering and addressing staff/partner group pain-points and answering proposals with ""well, back in 1980..."" is completely insufferable, and was entirely too common even in early 2013. I wonder if Merck's big employee cuts 2013-2014 has addressed this. Too many poorly educated, uncertified quality (regulatory) and safety staff. Bad rewards and competition program completely out of alignment with what is needed to support collaboration, courage, and candor.",Merck

A lot of the brands are regulated by the FDA because they are used to treat different things (allergies, fungus, warts, foot pain etc). Navigating the legal review process (for marketing assets) at Merck has to be one of the most frustrating things that i've ever dealt with in life. The legal review team is much smaller than it needs to be and some of the people on the team are not as good at their jobs as they need to be. Very frustrating - especially when you're working with time sensitive projects (need to get coupon out the door yesterday, legal review team is booked solid for the next 3 weeks). Promotion from Associate to full Product Manager takes longer than it does at other CPGs. Expect to be an APM for 3 years before getting promoted. Some people get promoted faster, but as promotions are a function of business need and not entitlements for a job well done, you're gonna wait. Saw a few people get blindsided by negative feedback and let go. That sucked. These were nice people who worked hard, not slackers. Seems like some people got the short end of the political stick. Don't assume that everything is going well just because they appear to be. Ask for feedback on an ongoing basis. The Consumer Care/OTC division of merck is very small when compared with other parts of the business. This doesn't mean that Merck doesn't invest in the consumer division, but it means that other parts of the business are much larger and they make a much larger contribution to the bottom line. When it comes to Merck making investments for growth, Consumer Care won't get as much attention as the Rx business. Summit is not easily accessible by mass transit if you want to live in NYC. There is a shuttle that leaves from Newark and goes to Summit - a good number of people take this. Driving to NJ by car in the morning isn't that bad, driving back to NYC in the afternoon/evening can be very frustrating because of the unpredictability of the traffic (sometimes terrible, sometimes really terrible).",Merck
