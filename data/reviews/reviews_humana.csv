1,"""Great Opportunities, If You Know What to Look For""",4.0,"The company is an industry leader in diversity, employee satisfaction, and member level care.","Many departments are run on few staff with large workloads. Automation isn't where it should be, which in turn makes the workload more burdensome.",Humana

3,"""Its a Big Company!""",4.0,Its a huge company so it has a lot of perks! They have some really cool benefits. You can earn lots of free stuff with your medical benefits for being healthy!,"Again its a big company so sometimes moving up can be hard unless you really get in with the right person. I was there for 6 years and seen several people advance because they became best friends with a Supervisor or Manager to move up. I am not the kind of person to make fake friends to move up. So I was left behind many times because I was not part of the ""In Crowd""",Humana
4,"""Good people; good place to work.""",4.0,"On the sales side, the company offers its captive agents a base salary plus commissions and a full array of benefits. Agents work from home.","I don't have any cons. For a large corporation, the company overall supports its workforce well. Personally, I ran into a conflict regarding my retirement benefits.",Humana

Great 401k-if you can afford to pay into it.","Time off only during off peak season which can last 3-5 months. Terrible ""error"" merit system (you make a mistake and it stays on file 6 months-this should be shorter). The health insurance is the worst I've ever had in my life. I pay only a single digit percent toward 401k, next deduction is my health insurance, family, only high deductible plans available, after deductions, last year I averaged only SIXTY PERCENT of my take-home pay. An average of 40 percent went to taxes, insurance and my tiny 401k contribution. To top it off, I STILL had thousands of dollars in medical bills to pay. Company contributes SOME toward the HSA HOWEVER you have to jump though ENDLESS hoops using a ridiculous, non-functional and completely not IT supported app to track your physical activity and biometrics and there's A LOT they simply won't give you credit for. If the app messes up and doesn't credit you points for activities, they just shrug and say welp, sorry. You never can recover the lost points. Back to the job, the call center aspect is probably a slightly better atmosphere than many call centers and my department has few restrictions on call metrics so that helps with the stress level.",Humana

15,"""Great pay, poor treatment""",2.0,"Hourly pay was great, as well as commission. You get to pick your own schedule after the standard 9-5 training is completed. They’ll cover the cost of your licensing, if you aren’t already licensed, during training. Amazing benefits that start from day 1. Pay and benefits are all that I miss from this company.","Dress code — why is there a “business”-level dress code? No customers are allowed in the building, no one sees you. Management clearly played favorites with this rule. Training — training was all over the place. No consistent trainers. One manager trains you for a few days, then another, another, another, etc. The training classes themselves are reminiscent of a high school classroom. The people they then pair you with after training is over are usually quite awful. For the most part, they’re unwilling to help you, other than berating you for not doing the job as well as them, or they’re bitter that they were asked to help someone and now they themselves are losing sales, so they’re not exactly helpful. Management — while there were a couple of truly, honestly great managers that I enjoyed working with and being around...most were just awful people. You can tell they were miserable and stretched thin, but it’s not an excuse to berate others or literally yell and insult people. Never a good way to set an example. Technology — computer systems consistently down and not working. Can’t make money if phones and/or computers aren’t working. Still expected to somehow make the company money, though. Overall, the mental stress isn’t worth the pay.",Humana

We are allowed to work from home on a regular basis, which helps a lot with work life balance and stress. I can see myself for the long haul here",A lot of people note that they do layoff occasionally. That is not uncommon for publicly traded companies. Associates should try to move up or even over sometimes. Staying in the same position for 10+ years is unwise.,Humana

The associates on the team are really close but not with the leaders.","If you are interested in a role on this team, please ask a former or current member of this team on LinkedIn. There is a lot that they don't reveal about this team during the interviews. They need better leadership skills on this team, from building a more positive collaborative environment and the leaders need to not be micromanagers. They think that they are building a team that accepts ""accountability"" but rather it's just an excuse to yell at the associates for the mistakes rather than working more closely alongside them to help them grow. You create a very negative culture from that bc the associates are really close to one another so they talk. They're super traditional so you report in at 9AM (no later than that) and you follow the rules (including business casual dress code). They also don't recognize that this is an area that they're severely lacking in so they refuse to focus on this to improve it.",Humana

Production was only missed because I was working right from a work list provided by management. In fact, this was the first month I said to heck with my own way or doing things and worked strictly from the list they provided. -Idle time too high. I do agree idle time is high, but no matter how consistently work is getting done idle time is always over their expectation. The idle time counter is ill understood by management and is micromanagement at its finest. How can idle time be 3 hours a day, yet production goals are far exceeded? Hours worked are more important than work done. -Case out of compliance. An aged case was found nearing the compliance deadline. Email was sent to management about said case. Management said they would take care of it. This was all documented via email. Case was not taken care of by management. The case eventually aged out of compliance and resulted in a write up.

It's almost worth the cons, would be great for people who like to work alone or not have to drive.","Poor leadership. There seems to be too many people that are in charge but no one knows who to reach out to if theres an issue they cant assist with. Theres a lot of communication problems between leadership. The break system is pretty bad. I've had my 1st break and lunch only 20 minutes apart. While WAH is amazing there are of course issues that follow. Namely, the group chats are not always helpful. It's sometimes difficult to get answers you need that you cant find yourself and once someone does finally reply they usually ask you multiple times if you've tried other means to find the answer. Which makes for long hold times and upset clients. The biggest complaint, I think for me, is the disregard for the workers time. Planning ahead for vacations or out of town trips is a nightmare. They wont approve your time in advance. I've been told there is no way to send time sensitive requests higher up, no one to email. If you plan a vacation months ahead and notify them several months in advance they wont give you info until the first of the month you have your vacation, if not up to the week of. For a company with this many employees youd think there would be a policy in place to ensure that employees are rewarded for being diligent but that's not the case. Leadership acts as though there is an entity far beyond their reach that you should just hope and pray to that they approve your request so you dont get told the vacation is not approved and lose out on nonrefundable suites, airfair, tickets, etc. Other cons include their systems, it seems like there is a lot of unfinished ideas to improve call rep handle times and this has lead to different information being located in 8 systems and you're told constantly to stop using that, use this and then a week later stop that, do this.

Upper management can deny it all they want, but that's what it is. Every position on my side of the telephonic business is having their feet held to the fire to meet incredibly high member ""connects"" every day, week and month. Not only that, there are elements withing those calls that are being measured as well like talk time for the day and referrals to other departments. So, if my talk time is way up and my number of contacts is down, I may have spent too much time on the phone with the members. Or if I reached a high number of members and my talk time was low my quality may come into question and my calls may be scrutinized. So, saying this you are probably thinking that I am working in customer service and need to stop whining, right?? NO! I work with members regarding their health needs, encouraging health goals, answering questions and providing resources if needed. Yeah. The goal for my day would certainly be attainable IF every person I called answered the phone. I have a coworker that made 45 calls to get only 11 successful connects for the day. They all have to be documented too btw. This doesn't include any anomalies in charts that need to be addressed and passed up the chain either. I can go on but I won't.

Good networking opportunities.,"The LTSS program may not be reflective of Humana as a whole, however, the depiction of the role responsibilities is very obscure. It sounds great at the interview with decent pay with mileage, however, they really really make you work for it. Although they recently changed to non-exempt, there are care coaches working over 40 hours per week without overtime pay. The culture of the company is fear driven and nothing has changed despite multiple complaints to HR. There have been multiple investigations regarding the unethical practice of the department through the Ethics Line. Upper management employs favoritism and borderline prejudicial hiring practices (they're all the same ethnicity, background and they are all friends). In addition, I was retaliated against when I reported fraudulent issues within the company. Responsbilities are vast and beyond the role expectations presented on paper. They are currently working off of two different documentation systems. Directives are disorganized and change from one day to the next. It is perhaps a good stepping stone for a person without a family, but not a good career choice for a professional. There are work from home opportunities, however, due to the extensive needs and high turn over rate, it is more field based and clerical work than WAH. At times, they push for mandated over time due shortages. I love working with my clients and built a positive working relationship with them as well as the providers. It allows for positive networking opportunities. With that being said, the provider relations department places a lot of responsibility on the care coaches. There is lack of support from that department as well as management. It was not a favorable experience for myself and many others that have left.",Humana

Also this year we witness special projects to help certain agents get more enrollments. Interesting that those same agents easily make goals while you have to work twice as hard to hit the same quota. Marketing also rarely uses our input and create misleading advertisments . We also get threating emails during AEP from the VP and Leaders who do little to no work.DMS telesales are receiving more roles like Dental, Vision, Group medicare and Med52 .

You get plenty of PTO if there are allotted hours remaining for you to be able to use it. Its a big, beautiful building with a gym on site. There are good departments to work for in Humana as a whole that you can really make careers out of.","Here is why there are so many mixed feelings on Humana from employees. The 4 worst departments to work in, are production based, metric driven, and managed by a no fault occurrence system that several FLLs get yelled at for not following. In my experience, the worst depts are Item Entry, Data Entry, Pharmacy (both trad mail and specialty) and Customer Service (PCC and CSR). Humana is very large and corporate does not have a strong presence here. Most of the time the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing. In the above listed departments they monitor every tiny thing you do. That means how often you use the restroom, how often you use the chat function to asks questions or collaborate with other depts to fix problems. They monitor the usual call stats, as well as call quality. The occurrence system is no fault, and I've seen people get multiple occurrences for deaths in the family, or even being so sick they feinted at work. Of course besides that, its the constantly unhappy customers. Humana has a way of gutting their customers and they people they serve are very vocal about it. The company has a constant method of almost shameless brainwashing. They will encourage FLLs to put on food days, or ask people to join charity events, or show some extremely unknown award we received that no one knew existed and that no one cared about. They will have ""culture"" days. They will have ""theme"" days. You see, they use the same brainwashing that other successful office workplaces use to make you take a sense of undeserved pride in your job. All the while they sweat and stress you to the max. Offering zero work/life balance due to the nature of the occurrence system. The metrics are out dated and inaccurate. Call quality is extremely biased. Etc. Etc. That aside, if you get blessed to KNOW THE RIGHT PEOPLE you can end up in a department on the lower level, where they are treated like human beings and can use the bathroom without supervision. They don't get micro-managed with horrendously soul killing metrics and they get to be the person Humana always said they could be. :D. So you see? Te company as a whole has big problems, but you don't feel them when you are in the cushy departments that let you act like adults. Then, when you are in the departments I mentioned, and there are several other terrible ones trust me, some fall prey to the brainwashing, and ultimately sell their soul for that paycheck.

I've seen this happen several times in my two years at this company. They claim they welcome internal transfers and they want you to grow your career with Humana but you only get a transfer if you know someone in the department you want to transfer to- not based on your qualifications or work ethic. Attendance policy is the strictest. As a new hire if you are late or have an emergency where you have to call off four times (this includes being late back from break or lunch) within your first 120 days you are fired.

Even better, some admitted to having no experience in the role they were filling at Humana. I moved to Louisville to become part of the Humana culture I was expertly spoon fed during my interviews. As a Millennial, I wanted to be a part of a team, to help create something bigger than myself. Even if it was part of a profitable corporation. I quickly learned, Humana hires, fires, moves people in your area everyday and nothing seems ""normal"" or transparent. Get used to CCing everyone you know on each email so you won't be blamed that someone wasn't informed. Save every piece of communication and have it in writing. You may spend more time in meetings proving who caused a problem and who should be blamed, rather than innovating and doing what you were hired for. Yes, you have 401k match. Isn't vested until at least two years after purchasing the stock. Yes you have education reimbursement, it isn't a given. Areas have a budget and it is awarded by management discretion. If you use it, you may be kept from taking an opportunity in another area of the company until management feels you've paid your debt to them. PTO is earned as you go. It's use is at managers' discretion. More than 40 hours for exempt associates is a given. Extreme overtime of 14 hours a day during project deadlines have happened.

Location in Glendale is very helpful for people who normally have to commute into Phoenix for work. If you are looking for steady work, decent location, and a job that isn't super difficult then this place will work for you. If you want more out of a job, like feeling important, being treated as an adult, and being able to bring recommendations to someone who will actually listen, you may need to look elsewhere.","Very strict scheduling. Your PTO is not advanced rather it is earned as you go. I got sick the first couple weeks I was there, unfortunately missed 3 days and was written up for having too many unapproved occurrences. You are also expected to stay your full shift even if salary. Getting all necessary work done and leaving early is not an option. I was actually told that I would need to just hang out at my desk and do nothing until it was time to go. Butts in seats is far more important because they are stuck in an old work methodology. You can tell they have a free flow of money because they throw it around like nothing by flying people back and forth across the country for completely unnecessary things. Eventually someone will have to come in and tighten the belt up a bit ensure money is allocated for innovation and evolution rather than business as usual tactics. The building in Glendale also leave a lot to be desired. The outside is very nice but the inside has torn up carpet pulling up from the floor all through out the building. The break rooms are very run down and tiny. The cafe they have is terrible as the selections are small and they charge for everything. You have to pay for a cup of water for instance if you do not have a personal cup. No cups for coffee either, you have to bring your own mug...seems small at first until you realize how petty that can be for an employer. The Glendale location also does not do any team events. I was there for about a year and not once was anything done for employee appreciation. Not a catered lunch, or ice cream cart, or sodas, nothing at all. Even though people do care, their frustration shows as they frequently bad mouth customers after getting off the phone with them. This happens at any call center but when it is done with the frequency that I have seen at Humana and the fact that is in regards to people health and well being, it takes on a whole new despicable meaning.Too many people are checked out at this location and are there just for the paychecks.

1761,"""Great Pay - Long Hours""",3.0,"The company is ideal for associates looking to build their experience fresh out of college, or for those interested in changing career tracks in a new industry. The opportunities to develop skills in leadership, professional development, and to gain understanding of the healthcare industry are readily available in a variety of roles. There is a high level of safety and autonomy for associates, though those in front-line (customer service, service center etc.) roles, will find fewer opportunities for growth. The pay scale average for roles is higher than for comparable companies, though salaried associates will find they're expected to earn it through long hours. The focus on well-being and work/life balance is a positive one, though not always realized in practice (especially not in frontline, service center or individual contribution roles). Some roles have agile work - meaning, work from home and/or flexibility. Health care benefit cost is moderate, and the monthly coverage is middle-grade. Diversity in teams is a huge plus, and the variance of skill-sets for associates is a unique factor for this company.","Depending upon the area of the business (non-management, service center) and the time of year (such as Open Enrollment), project work for salaried associates and/or volume for service center associates can be extremely high. It was common for associates to work 60-70, even some 80+ hour work weeks when large scale projects were nearing implementation. Associates may have to work mandatory overtime, including holidays. There are some very skilled and caring leaders at the company, though there are also leaders who focus on the metrics, and any focus on work/life balance completely disappears. Roles in education and training may be better suited for singles willing to travel and work extremely long hours, especially outside the office (evenings/weekends).",Humana

Your performance was great, but we have an acquisition, ACA, outsourcing, and now we are being bought out....","Top heavy organization that repeatedly makes the same mistakes over and over: Slash the number of people doing actual work, and then hire more management and consultants to talk about why the work does not get done.

No consideration for fairly frequent IT issues or Holiday time when members aren't home or don't want to talk. The only thing that matters is that the metrics are met on an hourly and daily basis. Also, if you are salary and have a regular dentist appointment you cannot take an hour of PTO time; you must take the whole day off, or it messes up the daily/hourly metrics.
