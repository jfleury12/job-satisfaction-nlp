They also supply a great 401k that is matched as well as a separate retirement fund that is 100% from Disney. I believe it's 15% of your salary 4 times a year. That adds up really quickly as well. The benefits are really nice as well. I was able to work from home a few days a week and was also given an orca card that covered my bussing unlimited. Each quarter you were given 10 valet passes that you could use to drive in and have your car parked for you directly under the building. I loved this because it allowed me to do things after work once in awhile without having to take a bus all the way back to my car first. Disney in my eyes and experience was top notch!,Not a lot of cons other than the commute to downtown for me was a little much but of course Disney alleviated that by allowing me to work from home a few days a week or more.

Bus drivers also get paid half way decently, as hourly jobs go at WDW, more than other roles, such as being a security guard. The Bus driver position is also about the easiest job at WDW (once you get the hang of it), and it is the easiest job to get too!!!","One works late hours in the the part time position. Full time can be booked 6 days a week. It is very hard, almost impossible to get a day off, unless you trade or give away your shift, which oftentimes with a little effort isn't too difficult to do. Some managers are are ""by the book"" and will scare you by being pulled in if a customer (a ""guest"" at Disney) complains about you. However, the Union does a half way decent job of protecting you, so do sign up for the Union if you decide to work there! If you have good people skills, you should be okay, and is a cinch. If you don't, don't worry, you will develop these in time. Another big hassle is their new 5 minute clock in, clock out time constraint with their point system. That can take some getting used to, if you haven't worked in that kind of environment. You get half a point for being even just a little outside that 5 minute window, and you cannot get more than 3 points every 3 months, or you get a reprimand. I think you can only get 2 reprimands, and on the 3rd, they let you go. You also do not want to have a ""signal 4"", which is running into something.

Sometimes, ASAs are even able to create small, memorable, “magical moments” for Guests. And while the price I paid for working for The Walt Disney Company chipped away at the magic for me, at least I know I was able to create a little magic for my Guests.","I share the following perspective having not only worked for DVC, but having received top performer recognition and having been promoted to next-tier teams. Guests who visit Disney frequently and spend thousands of dollars on a single vacation might do well to consider DVC. The Advance Sales Associate (ASA) role gives an opening to Guests who might be interested in further exploring DVC. However, significant inventory problems exist. Many Guests approach you because they are unable to book a desired room even almost a year in advance. Some Guests had their desired rooms switched by Disney at the last minute. The ASA is thereby recommending a product that has known inventory issues. DVC marketing materials might lead you to believe otherwise, and you won’t see many inventory complaints online. For example, on Facebook, DVC (or any other company) may delete or hide complaints at their own discretion. I was made aware of Guest frustration with inventory, and I became increasingly uncomfortable recommending the product. Also, annual dues increase each year, and some privileges are cut over time (search “DVC pool hopping” for one example). Of the corporations I’ve worked for, I’ve never experienced more ineffective leadership than at The Walt Disney Company. The environment harkens back a few generations to a “command &amp; control” environment, and hasn’t evolved. That means lip service from leaders and no real leadership or inspiration (unless satisfying shareholders counts). Neither front-level supervisors nor higher-level leaders for the ASA role truly listen to Cast Member concerns (despite a “we listened” campaign that occasionally selects one suggestion — usually an easy lift — implements a quick solution, and touts it as evidence that Cast Members are heard). Leader-to-ASA meetings have a one-sided agenda from the leader. Even worse, weekly all-staff meetings are generally used to berate all Cast Members for the shortcomings of a few. These weekly meetings are psychologically interesting. They’ll typically start with a leader declaring that the meeting will be inspirational, and then proceed to deflate people. Other indications of poor leadership are leaders’ lack of response to communications from Cast Members, playing favorites (I’ve personally seen individuals start at the ASA level &amp; get quickly promoted to a Sales Guide role, while those who have put much into their ASA jobs &amp; routinely deliver results get passed over for Guide roles), and double-speak (ASAs are told to “be Disney first” to Guests while also receiving e-mails from leaders recommending the ASA calculates how much money they want to make for the month and using that as a motivator to book tours). Leaders have proven to be rigid. ASAs are sometimes pitted against one another due to overstaffing a kiosk with light Guest traffic. Schedule adjustments are not allowed (despite the fact there is typically a several-hour overlap as one ASA ends their shift and another begins. ASAs are not permitted to leave early, for example, even without pay). Finally, most ASAs have great, average, and underperforming months in terms of booking tours. For the underperforming months, ASAs are given “performance memos” and eventually downgraded to a lower-tier team. To avoid being downgraded and to ensure their ratio of worked days to sales remains high, a good portion of ASAs call out sick at the end of each month. The system is flawed, and constant pressure to make and exceed goals is a culprit. A similar situation unfolded in recent years at Wells Fargo, unleashing a toxic environment. That should be all that DVC Leadership needs to see to change the culture.",Walt Disney

This creates a positive reinforcement for guests to be rude, lie, and be ridiculous. On an almost daily basis I see guests lie for free food. - As a food and beverage worker, you can get free fountain soda and plain black coffee. However, if you add a flavor shot or grab a bottle of soda, you can be written up. The managers, however, can do whatever they want. Same as the guests. But YOU as an entry level employee are under extreme scrutiny. - Starbucks lets their employees get free food and drinks, Disney is too cheap for that. When you do your training, you split *one* meal with the entire group that's training. Which is weird and gross. Someone else uses their fingers to grab a piece and then hands it down to the next cast member who uses their fingers and so forth, so when you finally get a small piece of food it's covered in other people's germs. Yipee. - Disney has ads for food banks in their cast member break rooms. - The only way to survive is to call scheduling every day to ask for hours or to work festivals at 12 hour shifts 6 days a week (with only 12 an hour, is it worth it???).",Walt Disney

Merchandise and food discounts bring the price down to moderately expensive from outrageously expensive.

Compensation is 20-30% below Orlando market. Promotions take years to happen unless you play the political game of sucking up to the right people and sacrificing all hobbies outside of work. Backstabbing is allowed to prevent people from moving to positions if they are unhappy with their current position. Senior management has no clue how to access financial data and relies heavily on analysts to do all work and hand to them on a silver platter. No vision or direction from senior finance leadership as the group is merely paper pushers. Any little ounce of recognition for the year is typically canceled to achieve financial goals.,Walt Disney

Always seeking to be innovative and create new ideas... and you get to be a part of it. Simply put, it was amazing to be surrounded by the work that you did. The people who were making it happen were also some of the brightest in their industry. It was fun to collaborate with people and trying to make next generation technology with such interesting constraints. Benefits-wise, the company is super progressive and definitely one of the top places to work at. Paternity/Maternity leave, PTO, sick days, WFH... by the time I left, I had over 5-6 weeks of time built up - even with taking sick days, that's how generous they were with the time. Obviously, Disney perks were great as well - free admission to the parks (including your partner and dependents), ESPN/ABC streaming, discounts, etc... Obviously retirement, health insurance, and additional onsite perks were available. (ie. cafeterias, on-site gym, nursing rooms, etc.)","Not everyone's experience is the same and I certainly will admit that I'm an anomaly in the group - My time there was spent trying to play a lot of politics. I was in the same role for over almost a decade and was not able to move up in either position or pay. By the end of my time, management was starting to make attempts to move me up but it was already too late for me. I had certain life events that had happened that forced me to make a move out of the company. In addition, I was in a very hostile work environment for almost half my time there. The combination of the right cast members, lack of upper management supervision, and my own personal attitude contributed to the hostile work environment. Lots of closed door meetings, yelling at partners, and lack of cooperation caused the environment to be tense. Thankfully, I got out of that specific environment a year before I left the company and am glad to say that is not the norm for Disney. I was paid really poorly, but I came from the bottom - literally - working hourly in operations and moving up. I had multiple conversations with my leaders about my pay and all of them denied me. Either due to budget constraints or there were other people who were ahead of me that they chose to move up. If you choose to go the internal route, be prepared to fight for your worth. As mentioned above, playing politics is the game. Also, if you were hourly, it was really difficult to perform professional-level jobs while sticking to 40 hours. Many people took their work home to finish writing e-mails, creating documents, etc. While this was openly discouraged, most of us found it hard to figure out how to fit all of our professional work into 40 hrs a week when we were tied up in collaboration meetings for half the week.",Walt Disney
475,"""Humanity is lost""",2.0,"Creating magic for children and their families is certainly rewarding, and the variety in what you can be scheduled always keeps things entertaining","Micro-managing, quantity over quality, everyone is replaceable so you never feel truly valued.

480,"""Good experience, but YMMV""",4.0,"A lot of these benefits have decreased since I left, so keep that in mind: 1) Great for families because you get a pass that lets you get into Disney for you and your children. It has blackout dates, but it is a nice thing if you can make it work. During the holidays, you get an additional set of tickets so you can let additional people in. 2) Health Insurance is on par with a lot of other companies. You have your range of options HDHP, PPO, HMO, etc. 3) Vacation is set to 3 weeks and increases after 5 and 10 years. You get 10 sick days that is separate from your PTO days. 4) Retirement is a standard amount (3-4%, but I forget the exact amount) 5) Free moving screenings for you and your family. The total benefits package is pretty standard, but good. Now anyone who reads a review for Disney should factor in that the company is so large and your individual team can have such an impact on how you feel about the company. Personally, I was on a great team and enjoyed my time at Disney. At the same time, other peers in other groups worked much longer and did not enjoy it nearly as much. It is a crapshoot whether you might enjoy working at Disney.","The biggest downside is the constant change through acquisitions or process improvements. This results in layoffs being frequent. It felt like there was always some sort of reorg on a yearly basis that resulted in some group being impacted. This is business as usual for a large company, but something to keep in mind. Don't go into the company expecting you will be here forever. You will be here for as long as the company needs you and then promptly disposed of.",Walt Disney

They talk big talks about work life balance and happiness and culture and values at work - but very hypocritical and very pretentious. Everyone is constantly afraid and I have seen perfectly happy people turn into anxious, depressed ones. It’s very sad to watch. No values and no culture whatsoever. Just toxic. Women get paid less.

You get a couple comp days per year but if you’re hired on or after October first, you lose out on those the first year. They consider access to Disney parks as part of overall compensation but you don’t get to go where and when you want. They have blackout days and Disneyland park is relatively not accessible (with few exceptions). Employees have practically no access to the parks in November or December. Not really fair in my opinion to offer as part of compensation if you can’t really use it! Additionally, some departments have pretty bad management and lack of structure/oversight. This can be good or bad, depending on who you are as an individual. The vast majority of employees use windows machines and the only OS they support is STILL Windows 7!! Cant speak for the entire company but it seems that they are quite cheapskates around here; can be tough to get the resources/supplies you need and they tend to recycle hardware instead of acquiring new/modern equipment even if it’s not the most efficient way of moving forward with certain processes.",Walt Disney

I consistently was asked to do things outside of my job description and worked overtime yet was told I could not clock those hours. My manager constantly would comment on my appearance such as if I was wearing makeup or not and asked what my ethnicity was on my first day of work. Everyone was age obsessed and treated anyone under the age of 30 like they were children, yet the “millennials” were the ones working until 10 pm at night while management literally did absolutely nothing. I felt like I was a babysitter for immature ill-behaved children for most of my duration at the company. The phone booths were frequently occupied by crying employees. I had every intention in this being a lifelong career, but instead I counted down the days until I could leave as if it were a prison sentence. There is no room for growth opportunities.

Cast members really make a difference in the small things they do with guests and that is very gratifying.","Management plays favorites a lot. Even though most managers leave locations and switch to another land/location every so years, it is still very click-ish. There are some great managers here too, but I seem to get stuck with the ones that happen to play favorites/be click-ish. I still get good evaluation scores, so no issue there. But its an uncomfortable feeling to be around. Also, pay is low. Could be better. I have had other equivalent jobs and this one is the record lowest paid for me. If you are not fully available for overtime at anytime when management approaches you, it can reflect on you poorly. Nothing bad will happen, it will just reflect on you poorly. I can do overtime, but there have been days when they asked and I couldn't in that moment, and it was not looked highly on.

I have had WAY better medical options at smaller companies before. 401(k) w/ company matching. Lower level employees don't get stock or wellness perks. You get the occasional screening and swag - but, anyone over 30 shouldn't be excited over a Mickey plush toy. So like, there's that.","Where to start? Room for growth is literally non-existant. They foster a culture of ""move out to move up"". Meaning.. if you want a promotion.. you'll have to leave the company to ""gain experience"" and then come back in a different capacity. As for the free park pass - they block out virtually every weekend due to revenue guests complaining about park crowds. So, if you want to actually enjoy the park - you'd have to call in sick on a random Tuesday. Yet, your Silver Pass is included in your ""total rewards package"" so, technically, you still pay for it. Complacency is also a huge issue. It should really be studied. People are willing to go years without a promotion, being reconginsed, no raises (just 3% for cost of living) all to say they work for Disney. TBH, I don't get it. HR knows they have the power of the brand on their side and that they have someone else waiting in the wings. They constantly hire from outside the company as opposed to looking within. Compensation is rigged. Much like the US economy - everything goes to the top. Executives get 6 figure bonuses at the end of the year, while lower level employees are often told by their leaders they had to ""fight"" to get them a 3% increase. We got told to cut back on ordering office supplies a few days after we received an email notifiying us that another film crossed the 1B box office line. Comical, much?

Disney has competitive pay for Los Angeles and touts a world class brand/IP. You take part in creating the magic in what you do. Culture is great as well and they focus on diversity in their hiring and team makeup.","- Overly political. The one downside is that as you progress here you will be gaining perhaps more skill in navigating politics than actually building. - Buy vs build. Disney tends to attempt to buy tech instead of invest in talent and build. Playdom, Maker Studios, Bam-tech, and others are all examples of this. Bam-tech will hopefully prove out to be successful, but many others have not. If we would just stop dancing around and make a real investment and go deep I would think Disney would have a better market share in many of the interested areas. But we can be very lean and risk adverse. We talk a lot about Machine Learning, but we won't actually invest much into building anything meaningful here.",Walt Disney

I think on some level management is aware they're not expecting a ton and managers here have been promoted after heading up total failure projects. There are entrenched figures with tight interpersonal bonds, their favorite people seem to snap up the lion's share of the raise money year after year, and the degree to which you're expected to put out 'extras' if you want a promotion (big raises really only happen with a formal promotion here along a pretty well-defined title hierarchy) is high enough as to not be commensurate with what the promotion will actually bring you. Enough long-timers here discuss year-over-year raise rates enough to know over-achievers here still aren't getting what they could elsewhere, but at the same time management is happy to let you coast and still get you at a cheaper and cheaper rate each year as the local tech market salaries grow faster. As a huge company with never-ending options that moves at it's own pace, they kind of know they hold all the cards with a long-term full time employee. All in all it's not a terrible place to work.

It can be thrilling and inspiring seeing your work come to life and feeling like you're a part of a movie's success.","Politics and workload. There is not much community beyond your own individual team and everyone is constantly trying to prove their worth. This means that collaborating on projects is difficult because everyone wants to claim the glory for themselves. Sometimes this can even result on your own team as you see others take credit for your work. This is not a place that allows people from all levels to have a spotlight shine on them. There is a very high (and sometimes seemingly impossible) expectation. Upper-level executives have high demands and expect to see their wishes and visions executed. Standing up as a voice of reason is oftentimes looked down on as being subversive or lazy, even if it's not either of those things. Due to the high volume of work, don't be surprised to see yourself working late, getting in early, working from home, or working weekends with some amount of regularity. To be fair, there is a somewhat new initiative to find an appropriate work-life balance, but in over a decade of working for the company, the bottom line is and will always be the work and employee satisfaction will take a back seat to that.

1149,"""If you want to make a difference - go elsewhere - you'll be happier.""",2.0,"I agree with most of the comments submitted below. It is important to note that the Studio works and operates very different than other divisions. So, if you don't like one division, you may be happier in another division. 1. You can't beat the IP The Walt Disney Company has. 2. Pay and benefits (monetary) are decent if you are Sr. Manager and above. (But still not comparable to other large organizations such as Amazon, Google, etc.","1. Pay lots of $$ to hire a majority of their workforce via Accenture or EY, eventhough they end up botching projects, overpromising, under delivering, and leave the studio with the bag. All the while ignoring their own workforce employees, who actually have a vested interest in the business. 2. Don't bother to foster growth and learning amongst employees. Culture fosters apathy and resentment and complacency. 2. Do not attempt to bring in new ideas, or you will be labeled an outlier or disruptor. Most of the people who actually care and want to bring in good ideas often get alienated or worse, get put on terrible projects until they can no longer bear it. 3. Upward mobility is nearly impossible. The title you come in with is most likely the title you will keep. (Although their is no problem increasing workload while cutting staff) 4. The consensus is that in order to move up.. you have to first move out. So, I've decided to move on. Perhaps I'll be back another day. 5. Many executives of Director and above are complacent. They get large perks to stay but neglect to foster the growth of their teams, or to continue to grow, be innovative or work on making the culture the ""Disney"" culture that the public sees. 6. Very political. Restating what a previous employee said because it rings true, ""Very heavy office politics come into play, and your opportunities for advancement are based largely on who you rub elbows with rather than the merit of your work. At the Director level and above, nepotism is rampant, you eventually find out that most of the heavy hitters come from the same companies. "" 7. Very disorganized and siloed because of competing priorities (and nasty politics). There is no one clear voice, or mission. Although it is written on paper and in an email, the executives nor the staff truly honor it. So, it gets passed as just fluff. 8. Executives talk the talk. But don't walk the walk. Meaning, they talk about making progress, being innovative, having a great culture, providing and fostering growth. Yet, when tough decisions need to be made - they hide behind middle management. If all goes well, the executives win. If not, the executives don't own the responsibility and the middle manager loses his credibility or worse yet, his/her job. 9. Behind closed doors, females are undercut and looked down upon for ""being too nice"". If you are not a part of the ""boys"" club, forget it. 10. If you have a family and are a mother, forget it (especially if you are Female). Expect to be looked down upon from most of the male (and oddly enough single female) executives. They expect you to work the same way as your single counterpart, otherwise, your big projects get taken away, and like #2, you get put on horrible projects until you are forced to leave. 11. HR is corrupt in Disney Studio. There have been many complaints of harassment from quite a few females and most have fallen on deaf ears, ignored, or again #2. Therefore, many females have opted to leave because there is no recourse.",Walt Disney

There is no vision for the future and no direction on what the teams need to do. From a career perspective, it's very difficult to move up the ladder and the people that do are usually the ones who know how to ""talk the talk"", but don't necessarily know how to get any work done.

Simply being hired seems to further open the already open floodgates of other companies trying to hire you when you work as a software engineer in California (LA area specifically). For single guys reading this, there is also a good amount of attractive girls and as long as eye candy isn't a negative distraction for you personally this can be a good thing. Really nice campus and people, not a lot of negatives I can say about Disney. If you are interviewing with them or was offered a position...take it. Unless you have an established history of working with the world's largest companies and would need to do more research to see how Disney stacks up against them, then this will be an immediate ""pro"" that you will feel when it comes to the doors it opens if you are ever in a position where you have to look elsewhere for employment, and with all the constant layoffs that seem to be quarterly from my experience having the Disney name on your resume never hurts. Although most websites seem to say every 6 months, don't count on it being that long between layoffs. I don't mark the dates of every layoff we had since I started, to me it felt pretty much seasonal.","What seems to be quarterly/semi-annual layoffs is huge. I'm not sure if this is a coincidence but this also lead in some areas and to some degree a negative and delusional environment at times. Negative in the sense that certain people seem to be so afraid of...whatever they are afraid of that they are willing to lie and throw others under the bus (via reasonable-doubt), than to take responsibility or get things done. Not to name names or specific projects but there was one example where team A failed to communicate something to team B and team B giving team A a failing grade on something they were asked to evaluate. This mis-communication was minor and affected little to nothing since the task would have been needed down the road when team A was actually ready for it, but the attitude in the resolving meeting was team A's manager coming in hot trying to put the blame on team B, team B correcting them and calmly explaining how there was no actual issue and that the work in question would simply be done when team A felt they were ready, then team A feeling relief and comfort once given the reality of the situation and assured that it wasn't a big deal or would be a negative mark on their team. To help paint a better picture without naming names or projects, imagine a manager coming into a meeting visibly upset and on fire, tries to put the blame on team B, have team B easily and quickly shut this attempt down, then turns to his/her team and literally walks down the line trying to get someone to fall on their sword for a non-existent problem so that they take the blame (and thus gets it put on their performance review, which ultimately means you'll face losing your job depending on your manager's personal feelings about you), just to have the other side of the table point out that the ""issue"" is such a minor thing that no one was concerned about and simply wasn't a big deal. At that point the fired up manager, which was at fault for the actual miscommunication, shows a sigh of relief akin to someone about to lose their home to not paying their mortgage that just won the lottery. That is the type of ""I will do anything to protect myself from admitting fault, even when the issue is simply in my head and is not a real thing, or is a real thing but not a big deal"" that you might see. Others include using reasonable-doubt strats to flat out lie to put another person under the bus, even if that person never did what was said or the person saying it simply having no idea what they are talking about. And when this is proven or shown, don't expect it to matter if your manager doesn't seem to like or respect you anyway. Yes this seems suspect and sketchy but once you realize HR's job is to protect the company rather than deal with managers and their suspicious on-going behaviors, which is the nicest way I can put it, then you can't be surprised to see how certain decisions or actions are taken by those that take it. Delusional as in, and this is just my opinion and perception, that people rather bs an issue rather than own it, deal with it, and move past it. For example a certain title was rejected by Apple due to its method of trying to use IAP; a violation of rules which any iOS developer should know about (sorry if that sounds arrogant but Apple's rules are pretty straightforward to those of us that work as iOS developers). Rather than admit time is needed to fix the mistake and just simply delay the game the necessary amount of time, the individual running that project ensured the higher ups the game will still make the deadline even though it was obvious to all of us that wasn't a realistic possibility. The day of or the day before the submission due date needed to ensure we can make the release date (I forget which) and it was finally delayed for needing more time. I always felt that this could have been a situation where someone(s) messed up but rather than just own it and do something about it, they bs their way to bidding time that just wasn't there. Of course I could be wrong but that is how it looked from my perspective. You'll see a couple questionable things like this that makes you wonder if the ""situation"" simply is a case of person A trying to save their own butts from what is likely to be the boogie-man rather than any real threat, even for minor things, rather than being a situation where they thought they could get it done but was wrong. Again I could be wrong since that was a situation from my perspective based on what I personally observed. You see a number of questionable things and it doesn't seem like it comes from the top since the top in every company I've been too, including Disney, tends to take the position of ""it is what it is, we'll deal with it"" and it is those managers in the middle that treats everything, even minor things, like it is a cause to enter World War 3. It is those managers that fall under what I am describing that DI needs to take a look at and take action against, especially when their competency and even integrity can be easily shown through strong evidence to require HR and higher up's attention at the very least - and this is me being nice about it. Even with that said, not to mention the ton of things I could say but don't have time nor motivation, I still recommend joining if you are offered employment if you are ok with the idea that it might only last between 1 and 3 years due to the very unstable nature of the company. Simply working for Disney (in my case DI) and living in CA pretty much has a number of companies trying to steal you away (which might just be my experience but it was profound). And not just small companies but big ones such as Facebook, Google, Activision, Amazon, etc will eventually have people reaching out to you for opportunities within their companies. No matter how long you are there, as long as you have a good team of people you feel you can trust - which was true for me until I joined the last team I was put on in the aftermath of one of DI's restructuring where I felt I couldn't trust the majority of the personalities there, then you will likely be fine. Of course I don't have experience working in every single department or job title, but what I have experienced I would recommend to others since Disney as a whole is a good company that will have many doors open for you simply by having had worked there. The highest individual I had any direct interaction with was Nikki Katz and she is, in my opinion, a very smart and level-headed woman that is great at her job. Most higher ups like her at DI gave me this impression that they are good people with a lot of talent, drive, work ethic, etc. My only issue is with a few individuals lower than them on the hierarchy. Any run-ins I had with the CEO was random and candid, like holding the door open for each other, but the impression I get is that he is also a good guy and works hard to try to make the company the best it can be.",Walt Disney

An awesome change in comparison to other workplaces that ask you to keep your head down and stick to existing methods without asking too many questions. Ideas are currency at this company. Tons of free classes and courses online and after work through DLearn, funded by Disney for employee growth. Constant growth and career development is emphasized strongly here, so if you're an ambitious professional in your field, there are many extra offerings to help you get where you wanna be. (You do have to seek them out yourself, but there are dozens of awesome courses ongoing all the time.) Community is also highly emphasized, and there are lots of on-campus clubs and groups that meet throughout the workday. Even if you have an adjunct interest in a field unrelated to your job, I haven't had any trouble finding support from supervisors to pursue those interests in classes and club memberships. Depending on your team and management, your mileage may vary. But changing departments and even careers is definitely possible here, and it's been emphasized to me by higher-ups that there is no shame in changing paths if we feel better suited doing something else. I've never had so much support and so many resources in my work life before joining DI. The Disneyland silver pass and 35% merchandise discount definitely don't hurt either. Food in the commissary is good and cheap, and facilities provides coffee machines and snacks on every floor. There is also a Starbucks on campus.",Different floors/department/teams are treated very differently. I know of one or two floors that definitely do not share my beaming opinions of our facilities provisions or fair treatment by management.

Additionally, our Senior Manager always brings in fruit, baked goods, bagels, chips, and candy just because. We always appreciate the thought our Senior Manager puts into our team. I also love I can easily walk to the commissary for lunch. I can also walk to ""The Patio"" to grab food and sit outside on the patio. It's very inviting and the food is really good. Also, I live about 30 miles from work but luckily, Disney has a great Commuter Assistance Program. It's a Disney provided vehicle, WiFi enabled, and I only have to drive 5 miles to get to it.

It is a very collaborative environment that still fosters autonomy in your work. It is rare to see micromanaging. There are many avenues for personal development and opportunities to climb the ladder. Despite being a competitive Fortune 100 company, there is still good work & life harmony, so not crazy hours.

1795,"""Must Be Part of the In-crowd""",1.0,"- If you love Disney as a brand, that makes the cons a tad bit (and I mean a TAD) easier to deal with. - You get to hear about upcoming products/movies before anyone else (that's kind of cool).","- Disney is an entertainment company so it comes with schmoozing, the typical ""who you know defines your importance"", and brown-nosing is the ONLY way you'll get promoted (forget hard work/talent/experience, that stuff doesn't work here). - They talk a lot about work/life balance and professional development but there's absolutely zero action behind it. Leadership says that they encourage you to keep a good work/life balance - but then they turn around and expect you to respond to emails and complete projects 24/7 (and yes you're required to do so). - You are 100% on your own - so if you don't do well with figuring everything out on your own (from where the commissary is to how to do your job) - then this isn't the place for you. - No such thing as leadership here. They're too busy schmoozing and doing everything they can to fulfill their own personal agenda - so don't expect to find anyone that you can lean into or learn from. - They boast a collaborative environment but only those that matter have good ideas - so if you're not part of the ""in-crowd"", don't even bother. If you do speak up, be prepared for your idea/suggestion to be either a) taken with zero credit to you or b) taken then scrutinized (as will you for even coming up with the idea; think Mean Girls to the 100th power). - And if you're wondering, the ""in-crowd"" consists of a group of inexperienced millennial-bots that only say yes and wing everything they do (because inexperience is key!). Overall, people work here because they love the brand NOT because of the professional growth/recognition/collaborative team environment/leadership support. If you're a big Disney fan, just be prepared to see all that goes on behind the magic. All of the good, the bad, and the really ugly of what Disney is as a corporate company.

Almost no one for over 2 years since I was let go, has made the effort to stay in touch, see how I was doing or pick up the phone to call. Very sad. It may be my feminine side over-reacting, but I feel a little jaded and betrayed that I trusted and confided in so many senior co-workers and fellow execs and now my secrets, thoughts and opinions reside with them.
