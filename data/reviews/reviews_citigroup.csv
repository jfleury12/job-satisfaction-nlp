This is key to moving ahead in an especially big organization.

Generally speaking and depending on your area, working remote is not a huge issue.","You can become a number if you don’t speak out and drive your own path.

75,"""Good Starting Point""",2.0,"Being a large bank, Citi has the resources to offer training in AML that sorta starts from the ground up, meaning you can walk in with no real knowledge of the field and walk out after several weeks with a working knowledge of basic typologies, red flags, and mitigating factors. Most of the people in my class had no banking experience and a few of us (myself included) had no degrees. The vision, dental, and health insurance were also great. Overall, if you're wanting to get started in AML and Citi is hiring, this is a solid place.","During my tenure, there was 1 major layoff which left half the floor without a job. As a monolith, Citi doesn't value the employees in ""non-revenue generating"" departments and we constantly got the fact that we don't bring in money thrown in our faces when we asked about when contractors would become permanent. Ultimately, the company has a culture problem. The employee engagement events were not accessible to people with food allergies or intolerances, which may seem like a small consideration but it's such a punch to the gut. Citi also has a habit of hiring a whole bunch of temps (sorry, contractors) because they got into a case backlog, then firing them once they're in the clear. This is a terrible business practice and ends up not only harming people but also produces shoddy work that just has to be cleaned up later. Rinse, repeat. For those select few of us who remained, opportunities to move within the company (either in AML or the bank overall) were frozen out. It led people to feeling stuck and angry and unheard. When I left, morale was at an all-time low and the department was hemorrhaging people. Like I said:  rinse, repeat. That's not even touching on the QA process, or how new processes were implemented with seemingly no forethought."

The option to take time off is there, but you have to know how to use it. It gets very tedious and ridiculous having to explain to customers(Home Depot credit services  demographic is generally  older people w less experience or less access to technology)  how to access their credit accounts 7 different ways. The issues with the credit website and logging into accounts just to access their statements seems to have been persistent with about 7+ months ongoing according to many customers. How do you explain to a customer they were notified they had an account that was opened up under their phone number  with a different name, that there’s nothing we can do about the endless notifications these people are receiving on accounts they don’t even have open! In all, very simple little things  can be done, especially with a company 207 years in the making. At the end of the day YOU are working your HARDEST for a company that is profiting off you, paying not even a livable wage for a job you’ll be spending more time at than your own home. The delightful customers you do get to speak to absolutely do not outweigh the amount of disgust some people bring to your day. It’s very quick to bring your positivity to an all new low."

The job description made it seem a lot more appealing, so I fell for it.   The work was extremely monotonous, and basically anyone with half a brain could do it.  You don't learn anything of true value from this position.  
It honestly felt like a trap, because since you don't learn any sought-after skills, it's extremely hard to land a higher level position in another department, let alone landing an interview with them in the first place.
There's virtually no team morale since management does not promote team activities/outings. 

Most of the AML departments at the Tampa campus are volatile, and there were some structural layoffs during my time there.   This was a major turn off to me because it didn't seem like there was a difference in job security between a full-time employee and a contractor."

106,"""Great company to build out your career - but a legacy institution.""",3.0,"-The people. Some of the smartest, most driven individuals who care deeply about the work, and the culture is quite open: people seldom turn down a request for a personal meeting and they are generous with opening up the network to you. So this makes a huge company feel like a small place, which is amazing. Also, people are genuinely kind and empathetic as part of our culture, compared to a place like GS.
-The work. Complex, rich challenges to tackle in all areas from talent to new product development to client experience and innovation, and really smart people you can tap to address those challenges - if you’re bored here, you’re not pushing yourself and you’re probably in your personal ‘comfort zone’. Great intellectual stimulation for those seeking that, and I found that in spades in the business.
-The global reach. Citi has been in many countries for 100+ years, so the relationships with global partners run deep. Few companies can match that know how and this global connectivity is an undeniable competitive advantage vis-à-vis our competitors.
-Benefits. Citi doesn’t pay at top of the market, but the other benefits are very competitive - including paid paternity leave, mental health benefits, and a variety of employee support programs.
-Culture. Always depends on your manager and where in the business you work, but generally trends towards more family orientation and flexibility and work life balance. With new push to the “CitiWorks” model (no one has offices, open floor plan seating, etc.), more people work from home at least 1x week, which means company is moving in the right direction. Also, a massive focus on pay equity, diversity, etc. are huge plus.","-Culture. Yes, there is a less bright side: While people are open, there is  poor change management capability (especially at the senior exec levels) so constant change by mandate is the norm - re-org after re-org and relentless cost-cutting measures and lay offs are the BAU... the result is heavy attrition of talented people and burnout for those who stay.
-Internal mobility. While Citi historically prides itself as a great place to build global talent, the internal recruiting and mobility process is currently broken at best. Jobs often don’t go to most qualified candidates (it’s who you know - the employee engagement survey points to this), the process of applying for a new job internally usually takes several months (and there is lack of transparency/feedback in process, etc.) and if you have aspirations to move internationally, you’re pretty much on your own moving yourself/figuring it out unless you are an MD.
-Slow to change. It’s a 200 year old bank, and the resistance to change runs deep. It is frustrating to see so many people with great ideas and those ideas getting dying in the vine constantly because: 1) key decisions are almost always made by senior leaders (meaning change leaders lower in the hierarchy are disempowered) , 2) company lacks the infrastructure to drive change: poor technology/productivity platforms, procurement processes are impossibly slow, etc. and 3) fear of failure - lots of saving face goes on, creating an environment where failure and experimentation are not welcome, therefore - innovation is stunted."

They have a 'voice of the employee' program which is suppose to be for employees to share ideas and concerns but during meetings management doesn't actually follow through with any of it. Micro managing is also an issue, it is all about the numbers and not about the person. They always talk about how it is all about the customer experience and then create new policies that only hinders the customer service. I am really good at my job and get some of the highest scores but there is no benefit to this. No bonuses, commission or overtime. It is all about who you know working at this company.

Contacted HR, tried changing shifts, etc. If you have a good manager, the job is bearable at most. There are a couple of excellent managers who anyone could rely on. It’s just a shame you’re forced to contact someone other than your own. Constantly changing systems, so pay checks were never accurate. Worked there 2 years and received raises. Lost them when they put everyone at a solid $15 per hour. Even at $15 an hour, it was sometimes difficult to stay positive when constantly being emotionally abused by customers. I couldn’t count how many times I walked into the bathroom to someone crying. If you can handle mostly awful management and mean customers, it’s the job for you. Oh! Also, they’re super strict about stats. I know someone who was fired for their handletime when all their other stats were perfect. You learn fast if you’re not their favorite."

All branches have less tellers, no assistant managers and we are expecting our Personal Bankers/branch managers to hit numbers of Financial Advisor to take home a 6% bonus or around $500 a month. Bring in a million dollars a month a bunch of lending, put your notes in Salesforce and here is a small payment for your long hours and stressful work environment where you are told that you will lose your job if you dknt got your goals. You either play the game or get cut and get rated a 4 at the end of the year for not hitting your impossible metrics.

Attendance policy is lenient.... TOO lenient **
Plenty of ""advancement opportunities"" **","It is a diverse organization however there is a huge gender bias. It's safe to say 98% of the management, trainers and supervisors are female and seem to favor female workers. I was in a training class where attendance was ATROCIOUS and 6 females should have been fired within the first week, however lasted up to 3 months when I decided it was time for myself to leave. There was no coaching or any type of action taken regarding attendance, however myself and a couple of other males were a couple minutes late coming back from a break and we got a swift talking to. 

I had a medical family emergency that was dire and I needed to take ONE day off. One day out of my 80+ hours I could use, and I was continually declined. My manager stated she tried escalating the issues however no one above her were even aware of my concern. I talked to a couple of my other female coworkers and they stated the manager pushed for their days off all the time. And their requests were minor concerns just to leave early to get the cable installed. 

They will lure you in with all of this vacation time but you will never get to use it. 

They will say there are ""advancement opportunities"". When I talked to a couple of floor support agents they state that the ""advancement"" is just them gating you to a new company and increasing work load. And continue adding more and more companies for you to handle and maybe eventually probable might be considered for a small ""promotion"" which is just a lateral move to a floor support. 2 floor support agents that were there during my tenure were already about to put in their 2 weeks because of all the miscommunication and professionalism."

If you apply to an ""Operational Analyst role,"" you may be thrown into a bad department, and overworked there to fix mistakes from previous employees who have long left the company.

They don’t share knowledge, they don’t help one another. Everyone from senior management on down is very hateful and promotes a hostile working environment. 

3. Managers play favorites and are allowed to do so. Citi hides their horrible business practices behind Florida being an At Will state. 

4. They do not care at all about their employees. They send them 25 miles to other offices for moths and months at a time with no more pay, no anything. They expect you to work OT without so much as a “thank you” or acknowledgment for hard work. 

5. Upper & middle management is the sorriest excuse for leaders than I have ever seen. I have no idea how Citi is still in business, let alone one of the biggest bank in the world.

Citibank issues ""know your client"" letter and expects sales roles like us to service all the clients. In order to know what the client needs they have to call another department that never picks up.

Interdepartmental limitations creates a case where ""I can't help you call the other department"" run around.

Systems are ancient so frequent downtime

Branch management is incompetent because they don't support you in your position to help with servicing when you need to focus on sales. 

If the area does not meet goals, the area creates call nights for branch bankers to out reach to clients. The mandatory call night is usually planned last minute and forces employees to stay a few days a week after work until appointments are made.

The leads they create are recycled leads from the previous quarter and management expects you to get something from them."

Targets are not realistic and since you will receive a base salary higher then most bank sales positions you will be reminded daily/weekly that you are expendable if you are not selling consistently. They hold the base salary over your head like it’s our fault they offered it to us. Max life expectancy of a CRM is 1-2 years. Anything over that the stars must be alined. Expected to make between 25-40 contacts a day with clients, which can be achieved but with everything else on our plate in the branch can be very hard.  Micromanaged more then any company I have ever worked for. Actually using any of your vacation time is a stretch. Annual bonus for most CRMs equals a few thousand dollars if that.  The challenges are that there is simply too many other (much better) options at other banks for the clients with better technology for them to keep their money at Citi. Don’t blame them.

Although, I worked for two less than qualified managers in the past, I found a role within the company that is a better fit.

6. Competitive pay. 

I strongly believe that working at Citi isn't just a place to be ""employed and get a paycheck.""

The amount of ""red tape"" at this place is an enormous hindrance on creativity. The simplest of things are made difficult for no reason other than to check a box that was designed by some business person that somehow obtained their CISSP.

The hypocriticalness of this is massively amusing.. you don't have administrative rights on a Citi provided laptop, but business units supporting the trading markets are allowed to run 30 year old operating systems with huge vulnerabilities.

The culture is nothing short of depressing. Some reviews on Glassdoor will suggest being remote makes for difficult collaboration, but I can assure you that you're better off being remote, as being in the office is very demotivating.

Citi bank makes it hard for employees to perform they’re job fully because the branches are short staffed, or something is broken, AND the system pretty much has issues every day. On top of that, they don’t give you a raise. I worked three years there, even got a higher title, but no raise. Just got told to refer more and that I would make more money like that.

Those with exceptional talents and skills can find opportunity here.","Citi once had a reputation for innovation and entrepreneurship.  Since the Travelers-Citibank merger that has given way as a different corporate culture emerged from the merger and subsequent challenges.  While Citi still offers a career for those who want to pursue a career in financial services, it is no longer the best place for mid- and upper-management who have built some credibility of their own but want a more aggressive, creative and entrepreneurial work environment.

Decisions made by functional units are often made in a vacuum that supports the unit goals but are often not in sync with wider corporate goals.  Decisions also are slow in coming, and corporate politics, borne of multi-layered bureaucracy, can have greater influence than basic business sense would otherwise allow.

Opportunities for mid- and upper-level managers are questionable unless one is looking only for a relatively stable and safe environment where performance is largely gauged by how well one does what one is told.

Managers who question, are innovative and are constantly looking at the appropriateness of how things are done will probably find the environment stultifying."

Offers a lot of promotions but majority of these promotions , clients don't see the additional money they were supposed to receive or etc. Puts WAY too much responsibilities on tellers. Underpays people that are promoted. Would rather pay more to inexperienced outside workers rather, than pay the loyal employees who's been in the company more. (Like currently theres a lot of incoming new part-time tellers getting paid more than full-time head tellers). Expect part timers to work full time hours for less and with no benefits. expect employees to work more than 40 hours a week , and not have a life other than Citibank."

You'll get plenty of paid time off, and depending on your department, you can work remotely a lot of the time, which can helpful for work-life balance.

Most managers are located in New Jersey or NYC, and you'll never see them. This results in a disconnect. They may forget about you, see you as numbers, see you as an inconvenience, or all three. Teams may be scattered too, which makes this issue worse.

There is a severe lack of training. Management often expects you to understand complex internal systems the first time you look at them. They don't offer any training or documentation to help with this. They overload the senior employees with work since they won't trust their newer employees, so seniors can't help train either.

Work-Life balance can be strained, especially if you have a highly international team. Management may also expect weekend work and refuse to give any comp for it.

Teams generally don't work together, communication  between teams is nonexistent, push back by senior management is usually on their own team, and very little support given to employees to grow and develop. 
Bonus for most people is 0, don't buy the lie that HR tell you, insurance is expensive and has a high deductible. Overall, I'd say if you get a good base salary and don't care much about your work, this is a good place to work, otherwise you will be frustrated, angered, and have nothing to show for after all that.

Sometimes they treat their employees like prisoners yet wonder why people keep quitting. I was there nearly a year and never once did I hear a manager thank or show appreciation to ANYONE for the work they did.

Upper management would continually make changes to things that had nothing to do with work yet the things that needed attention went ignored, sometimes for months. This was one of the most unhappy work environments I've ever worked in. No one wanted to be there and they weren't shy about letting it be known. No one cared because management didn't care.

My major problem with Citi is the hiring and promotion process. I have seen people promoted who are completely incompetent. I am unsure as to what standards they make these decisions on, when someone gets promoted to manage a branch and has no capacity for empathy, and is lacking in people skills.

Uploading documents that are already in digital format are converted to a format that loses much of the original clarity, so we ask the client for the document again and again. We are getting out of the post sales servicing business and having Cenlar take that role over.  Appointments with clients are cancelled for internal meetings constantly.

2276,"""Just Enough But Not Too Much...""",2.0,"If you are happy with your job and work hard you can work at Citi for your entire professional career, as many people do.  They are masterful at providing you with just enough of a salary bump and/or other incentives to keep you content and suck you back in year after year.  Its never anything over-the-top to get you super excited about but its also nice enough to make you feel appreciated and valued.  That feeling coupled with its infrastructure, resources, solid benefits, good 401k options and other random perks of working for a global bank is enough to keep many people there for 20, 30 and even 40+ years.","Anyone who has worked there will confirm that the layers and layers of middle management is absurd.  These middle managers are non-client facing  people who somehow feel that they know more about sales than the bankers, more about compliance than compliance analysts, more about the banks clients than the relationship managers, and so on.  Because they really don't serve any real purpose they feel the need to involve themselves in anything they possibly can and more times than not make it more difficult to conduct and close business on a daily basis. There are so many instances where if people were removed from the reporting chain or had their abilities to approve certain things taken away the process of doing business would be drastically improved.  Its all about validating themselves to ensure it appears that they are needed, when ultimately they just need to go away and Citi needs to recognize it....but never will.  This is one of MANY issues that Citi has in every part of the bank.... the list of cons could go on for a long time.  Career Advancement, salary increases, career mobility, recognition for going above and beyond all take a very long time and a lot of self lobbying and often times you really need someone with influence on your side to get anywhere or get recognized for extraordinary work both internal and client facing clients.  There are a lot of instances where poor performers, weak producers and general underachievers who play the game of politics and kiss up to the right people are given promotions and raises and awards while many exceptional people who don't play the game and don't make it their job to be a kiss-ass or put on an act dont get recognized or given the promotion or raise and its disgusting and disheartening to watch.  So much of your ability to a success at Citi rests on how willing you are to ""play the corporate game"" and not actually on how good you are at your job. LOTS of PROBLEMS."

Current UI team I am working for and now working full time for is a very important team with lots of areas for growth and opportunities. 

Citi in general is more casual then other banks. You are expected to work in business casual and job security is much better then some large scale banks.","For rotation program, I have to give some caution that not all rotational groups are the same and many can be of lower quality then others. Some groups just use you as an extra resource rather then give you anything to help you grow your skills.

Citi, like a big banks, are bureaucratic, political and they focus much more on the financing then the tech. The current UI team I am working for maybe a little better at updating their tech stack and on-boarding good people but it still suffers from what I have said previously.

Current UI team never pushes back against business to give employees time to properly test, analyze or even code. This can produce a lot of bugs, lower the teams coding standards and cause unnecessary stress for everyone.

Growth (like promotions) in the company can be slow."

If you don't have a good working relationship with your manager and there is no growth opportunity or transfer opportunity where you work in the company, you are doomed. That was my experience. The entire floor is set up in tiny half walled cubicles. Everyone and I mean everyone (VPs included) were in them. It did not matter how much quiet or concentration your job required or what the stakes were if you made a mistake - you were in a bull pen environment . No one respected your space or need for quiet in that environment. The managers all had conference calls at their desks, meetings at their desks. Parties in other departments on the floor. Citi was also very bad about having ""clicks"" and the management tended to be hobbled by senior management to the point that they had no real decision making authority. What resulted was a ""Stepford"" like unit. There was just no escape and no one to tell or who would listen."

The diversity is really incredible,  and they are very supportive in many ways.","The internal politics can be a bit much, and change is the only constant in terms of management in some areas.

For folks who are good with proactively reaching out and outspoken (Type A personalities) , firm is a great place to learn and expand career.","Challenge is that Citi is so big that the message dilutes and changes by the time it gets down to the organization (game of telephone).

2415,"""It Depends""",3.0,"There are a lot of great opportunities throughout Citi considering how large it, and also in the audit department. There is space for promotion or movement in the company between departments.","Because of how large the company and the audit department is, and with teams being compartmentalized, it's also a hit or miss regarding your growth opportunities depending on the team you're on. Some senior managers empower their teams, some don't, and others are outright unethical. But that's to be expected in such a large company, not everyone is going to do the right thing."

That's really about it - not much going for this company other than that.","Upper management is completely out of touch with the people below them. I'm actually amazed that the bank still functions, generates a profit, and satisfies it's shareholders. Reports are never done on time. Things are always thrown together in emergency meetings just to get reports out. 

This company is awful. They provide zero training once you start, leaving you to completely fend for yourself. This is expected in most jobs but there should be at least a small amount of support such as how to actually use the systems specific to the bank. You can't be expected to come in and know how to use a program or database that you've never used before. 

No organization skills by upper level managers and whenever anything goes wrong it turns into the blame game. It's always the Directors or SVPs blaming their VPs, AVPs, and Analysts. Hey never take responsibility for themselves, and are extremely unreliable."

2433,"""Senior Teller""",3.0,"There was a lot of autonomy in this role, the company provided some benefits, and I got to know my clients well because we had a small branch.","The managers were lacking in training, did not encourage growth and development throughout the branch, and had obvious favorites. The pay did not justify putting up with this aspect of the job.

The trickle-down of the area director's decisions didn't always translate for our small branch, so some of the goals ended up being unrealistic."

You have to watch your back and worry about someone pulling something on you or your team. Long pointless meetings, low morale. 

No incentive to care as you can be re-organized out of your role. I've seen departments disappear overnight and people hold their breath when am email comes with an important announcement. Is this the end? Is my manager fired? Am I? These are questions you'll soon learn to ask working at Citi. But don't worry, they're just making some fine adjustments so we can work more efficiently and cohesively.

When you have directors asking you to frame questions a certain way so we can prove your department's value to senior directors, you know you have a problem. Very hard to move up, you have to come externally to have a higher title. Instead of employees, we now use contractors for a lot of roles, but you have to worry if they're planning to replace you with them.

If you're still reading this, you're probably going to take the job here despite all this. I don't blame you, it pay well and might be close to you and could get you some banking experience. BE SURE YOU INTERVIEW YOUR DIRECT MANAGER! Find out how they work and their attitude towards their subordinates. I have seen some real crummy managers who are not flexible and micromanage everything. Nothing sucks more than seeing coworkers live it up with a manager that's great while you're stuck with one telling you off for something stupid like going to the restroom. While I'm exaggerating about the restroom, I hope you get my point."

Nice part of town.","There is literally no on-boarding process. My direct supervisor was useless. Bragged about his 12-hour workdays. Everyone around me, every day, was just grinding it out with minimal vision, minimal strategy (no why/how - just find the nearest problem and start working.) Pay was low from the get-go, but it's my own fault for accepting. I should have seen the writing on the wall. My boss balked at an $11 fee for a new Citi group email (suggested by another employee as a process improvement.) He literally said, ""it's $11? Let me think on it."" That's how cost-conscious Citi is, so I couldn't wait for year-end raises (not.) No one in my group took lunches. So tied to their desks. Also, AVP/VP is a joke. Title structure is a joke. It isn't nearly as prestigious as one may think, and their pay demonstrates it. After I accepted, my AVP role suddenly showed in the system as AVP Analyst. 

On the day I quit, one of the NYC execs was doing a webinar. No one in my group attended, because no one freaking cares about the big picture, apparently. They just sat there, slumped in their desks, grinding it out. I dialed into the webinar and reviewed the anonymous questions posed by Tampa employees to the NYC exec, for him to answer. 9 of 10, no joke, were about the bad morale, bad pay, and lack of vision in Tampa. It confirmed everything I'd seen. I quit 2 hours later, and walked out with a pep in my step.

Final word: after speaking with several recruiting firms, they all nodded their head when I talked about Citi in Tampa. One recruiter said ""Citi sucks, everyone in Tampa knows it."" I'm so glad I left, and I pity the people who stay there and grind it out. There's so much else out there.

2645,"""Experience depends 85% on your manager and team""",1.0,"Like Citi overall down right hate current manager and coworkers.  Big name to put on resume with many employee engagement events from tug of war literally to family feud. You literally get to excuse yourself in the middle of the day for friendly competition i.e.. summer olympics and etc.. or tailgating in the Parkin lot to dress down for Irish holidays or bills football games. 
Chance to network with senior management and work from home depending on your manager/department as some people are easier to work with than others. And do take this literally!!!
Happy hours paid by senior management that visit from outside of buffalo or NYC 
Ability to transfer overseas if a position is available.","Some of the managers/peers are unprofessional and disrespectful prejudice even.
As well as extremely Cut throat!! If you don't play the game be prepared for constant harassment and ridicule. And hope you're not the only person of color on a backwards minded team since if you don't play the role of ""token"" they will harasses you and go on smear campaigns to ruin your chances of securing a new role within citi at the end of the year. As a lot of managers are in cohorts with each other.
Lower pay compared to competitors 
Metrics system is rigged since there are only a few scores ranging from 1-4 with 4 being the highest and a one needing a minimum score of 3 in order to transfer into a new department/role or be eligible for a promotion. For example a team can have 10 people and have only 2 scores of 4available 2 scores of 3 and then 1 score of 2 and the last five scores of 1s will be given to the remains five analysts. A score of 2 means you are holding on to your job by a string because you're doing the bare minimum to keep it in your managers eyes. And scores of 1  mean you're on the verge of facing disciplinary actions i.e. Termination. So despite how hard people work there's only so many good scores up for grabs. Brown nosing and politics unfortunately will overshadow performance. Despite diversity initiatives some people are still racist and rude and make disgusting comments that hr will write off as ""coaching"" as they are only there for Citi's best interest i.e. Management not yours. Location is off of a highway in the
Middle of nowhere with terrible reception inside and outside of the building so if you're doing phone interviews during breaks be prepared to lose reception or have to use a sick day or planned vacation to seek other opportunities. Again overall experience varies depending management/team/department. Back office/operations in general is boring head banging against the wall 9-5 barely middle class gigs anyway."

THE BRANCH OPENS. Why? Because CITI uses
Outdated pre historic technology. It takes 20-30 mins to log into your computer. Then 45 mins to do tedious un related to your SALES job activities like ""balancing the ATM"", night drop, debit card logs, and over 10 OPERATIONS related tasks. 
CITI is all about cost cutting, at the expense
of their employees. They are removing the assistant manager role in most branches and replacing them with ""virtual assistant managers"". Basically forcing the bankers to pick up the slack in operations. 

Every aspect of your day is watched carefully by your manager. It will start with ""scrubbing"" leads at 9am, basically getting a list of customers who you will call for 2 hours  to book appointments. This will happen EVERYDAY. Completely mindless job. 

You are basically a glorified telephone operator. Majority of your time will be spent on the phone with the back office resolving customer issues and problems. You will go home feeling angry, depressed, and frustrated. Customers see it and feel it. 
Especially with citi's policy on cash transactions.
ANY transaction involving cash(deposit, withdrawal, payment on credit card, etc..) requires the customer to present government issues ID, social security, and job occupation. Think about it. As a Citibank CUSTOMER, you have to present this every time if you don't have your debit card with you. RIDICULOUS. Daily shouting matches with customers about this. Employees and Customers BOTH HATE IT. 

The only bankers at citi who earn decent commission are ones who have worked in that office for 10 years or more. Because they sell the same checking and saving promotions to the same customers every year. Example - customer opens savings account with 50k, keeps balance for 90 days. Earns 500$ bonus. Closes it out. Repeats every 6 months. Banker
Will make commission on that same customer year after year. That will not happen for bankers who are NEW to citi. NEVER. After all the senior bankers retire, citi will have a hard time surviving.
Citi recently pulled out of the TEXAS AND BOSTON market. After only a few years. Total fail. 

Many managers are incompetent, or when they do get something right they have no power to implement it. Laughable, out of touch policy gets handed down from upper management - which is completely remote from the front lines, then your manager has no authority to change it. They all end up rubberstamping a very disjointed, inept corporation.

HR department allowed an incompetent manager to continue to harass her employees even though this person is a repeat offender; I submitted a claim and they instead turned against me and proceeded to delete all records of my grievances.  Senior management is aware of cultural issues but won't do anything to change it. I met a lot of unsatisfied employees who only stay because of the competitive pay. Too many processes that get in the way of actually getting things done, and too many officer-level titles which leads to an oversupply of inflated egos."

If they schedule you on a holiday, you get paid double time and a half which is awesome. they also let you use holiday time for days off if you want too. You can choose an hour lunch or 30 min lunch and you get two 15min breaks . co workers are great and the managers do care about you. They have other job opportunities to apply for with in the company.","training doesn't prepare you for the phones.  My trainer called it survival training which meant you learn about 20 percent of what you need to actually do the job. When you get on the phones, you will feel like you have no idea what you are doing. They do have people there to help but when someone is on the line and you have them waiting it puts a lot of stress on you. After a while you will learn and know what your doing. 
They make it seem like you can change your schedule a lot but you can't. You can change it once a year, and it goes on a seniority basis. Also they have people quit a lot and they don't replace them right after, so in my department we often would get back to back calls which can get really draining. They are really big on meeting handle time goals, quality goals, and other goals there. If you don't improve, they may fire you. There was a girl who had gotten an award for best 1st call resolution rate but yet they fired her shortly after because her handle time was too high. It seems like they focus too much on what you aren't doing right.  As long as you meet your goals you'll be fine though.

Leadership is now focused on removing a lot of barriers to being effective, implementing Agile in IT and business areas, hoping this succeeds","Extremely bureaucratic, internal process compliance culture is extreme / over the top, stifling productivity and competitiveness, generates unintended outcomes. This is starting to change, but too slowly with key areas not on board"
3301,"""Soul-sucking stupidity""",2.0,"A resonably competent, intelligent person will have an easy time at Citi. But you will have to deal with a lot of stupid people, especially in the ""management"" bureaucracy. And you would do well to remember not to care, no matter how much they try to force you to care, because otherwise you'll be very unhappy caring about stuff that doesn't matter.","Management constantly tries to overtake your life, applying ridiculous pressure to achieve goals that were assigned by people who have no clue, on timelines that bear no relation to reality. Always push back because there's no punishment; they just want to intimidate you into getting more work out of you for less money. If you accrue overtime, they'll often make you roll it over into another week where you'll work fewer hours, so they don't have to pay overtime rates. Citi is already involved in a class-action lawsuit over that practice, but they keep doing it.
Citi laughably reveres the uninvolved upper management as ""the seniors"". Title inflation is rampant. A simple team lead/supervisor is labeled Vice President, President or Director.
Employees have good benefits but no work-life balance. Having 5 weeks of paid vacation is useless because you can never take it when you want, only when management says you can. Usually they just tell you to take a week off, with no warning, so you can't plan for anything. Then they still expect you to work on your vacation.
Citi harps on ""compliance"" and following all sorts of rules, but they often follow only the letter of the rule-- there is a well-established workaround for every rule.
Citi relies heavily on Indian and Pakistani contractors, so women at Citi often suffer from a hostile work environment. If you're Indian/Pakistani, black, lesbian, transgender, or ideally a combination of all of those, you're in a ""protected class"" at Citi. Everyone else, not so much.
Remember, banking is one of the worst industries to be in (like farming, only with less death and dismemberment). Pay is low, morale is low, opportunity for advancement is low. So in that regard, Citi is typical. There are MUCH better places to work. I work here because it's convenient and I don't have to work hard for the money. But I would not recommend Citi to anyone as a career, or as anything more than a stepping stone to your next job at a different company. ""Soul-sucking stupidity"" is a good summary of the work environment at Citi."

That's why they're constantly laying people off and hiring through 3rd party contractors. Not to mention, the company hates paying OT, so managers typically won't allow you to report any OT, even though they may have required you to work extra in the first place. The way they get around it is comp time, but make sure you hold their feet to the fire for that, because depending on who you get as a manager, they may or may not really keep track of what you're owed

Terrible work/life balance. Total corporate suck up culture whenever upper management comes to town.

Difficult to grow up the food chain, due to lot of politics and internal issues. Lots of different political groups based on regional/racial basis. 
Senior Management is pretty insecure and they will not allow any changes to organization. For any new project everything looks perfect, but when it comes to execution, we fail or take more time to execute than other banks. 
Technology group is pretty retarded in next gen approach; they don't have any consistently on their decisions.
Employees from some locations are insecure, they will not allow a new person to provide better and new ideas, even if project cost increases drastically or is bound to fail.
Hiring standards are worst in the industry, they hire based on recommendations and lobbying
One external client/vendor says ""if I want to work with Citi, I have to work with three dozen people instead of three or 4 people"".
Agile/Scrum is a big joke,  none of the decisions are made in scrum team, every decision goes back to managers for approval. The work hours estimate for regular waterfall development and new agile/scrum process  are still the same. Senior management does even look or try to understand why we cannot execute projects similar to other companies in industry. Citi GCB is like GM in Automobile sector. All the profits in last five years in GCB are by selling citi holding assets or exiting other countries.  Citi GCB should go through complete overhaul similar to GM

C Level Management had organized many seminars and recommendation from external technical evangelist to internal teams to improve the way Citi works, but these recommendation are never executed or failed to execute.

The only last major accomplishment is executing Costco project on time."

It was like working underground for 10-12 hours at a time. Supervisors often do not know how to do the work themselves, they just sit back and criticize while their employees drown. The unprofessionalism in interpersonal communication really took me back. I have worked in other financial institutions and never had a supervisor cuss at me like a child before working here.

You will be micromanaged to a level that you have never dreamed of.  They are telling new hires ""You can make 100K"", when in reality they want you at 60K and will put numerous stops in place to insure that.  They are dishonest on many levels.  I've never worked at a call center sales environment where they want to limit your pay, but that is reality at Citi.  It is not a level playing field - they route the good calls to specific employees.  The balance of the leads are terrible.  They only provide purchase leads and most of the borrowers aren't qualified.  They are in the process of replacing long time dedicated experienced employees with cheaper college like inexperienced workers.  Mortgage reps at this location are amongst the lowest paid in the industry.  Management know this and refuses to pay a fair wage.

Company is solely number focused and do not care how you obtain them, raising the bar every year, and asking you to beat last years figures, by any means possible.

I witnessed this with one of the second year analysts who left shortly after I started. I also found that HR really only sees you as another replaceable part to be worked to death and ditched - and then they wonder how come their retention rates are so low. And once you're out, it's as if you never even worked there.

The Progress Point location was decent and opposite of the CRC.
There are more Citibank positions opening and appears to be a better department.","Way too many to list here. The Mortgage department is in complete disarray and almost all people are only concerned with self preservation. This isn't worth wading through the BS and frustrations unless you are a C13 and above. Then you just act like you are working on projects which will change in 6 months and keep cashing paychecks. Multiple senior management changes and reorgs but no direction. Citi is a shell of what it was 10 years ago and they are only interested to achieve nothing but short term paper savings. They will outsource whatever they can and not care about the results unless large numbers of customers leave. Internal job transfers are a slow process and difficult to move up unless you make a connection. It is true that you are better off quitting and applying externally for the job that you really want in order to move up. 

So many lies and crap procedures that people are only concerned with CYA. You can't trust anything people say in this organization from most managers unless you have it in writing and print it for proof. Be careful if you choose to speak out and expose said lies no matter the importance. Denial is their best friend and they will not appreciate a logical concern with evidence. There is a reason why Citi is continually paying hundreds of millions in ethics related fines every year. Never leave the Progress Point location to go the CRC."

Overall the company is fine to work for.","The company as a whole may be fine to work for, but there are several problems with this position/department:

Work/life balance is skewed in this department - the department is running 24/7 and they have to cover all that time. EX) 1st shift is 0600-1430, 2nd shift is 1330-2200, and 3rd shift is 2130-0600. This is also not a M-F position, most people in the office work on a non standard week, Su-Tr, Tu-Sa, etc. While there is a pay differential for ""non-standard hours,"" it is also extremely difficult to get into a schedule that is considered standard M-F. Taking time off is also extremely difficult, as the entire department is currently understaffed, especially on weekends, and they have a minimum number of staff that they require be there to cover their products. So if you work every Saturday, and want to take a Saturday off less than two months in advance, good luck to you. Oh and the opportunity to take off holidays at the end of the year was gone in the vacation bid at the beginning of 2016, which was based on seniority so most people did not get those days off. Also, if you were awarded a new schedule, be prepared to wait 3 months at a minimum to move into your new schedule as they require that your current shift be filled before you can move. And with how slowly they are hiring, and how quickly we are losing people to other positions or companies, moving shifts is becoming more and more difficult.

For a position that is salaried and is considered an exempt position, there are very little opportunities to take breaks - most analysts do not take lunch every day, and even when you do feel you have the opportunity to take a lunch you are only allowed 30 minutes.

Feedback in this role is also abysmal; the department had a total of 5 managers for a 100 full-time, salaried employees for more than 6 months before filling their management gaps. During that time, year end reviews were held with managers that have very little time to notice you and provide actual constructive feedback. Management consistently speaks of ""progress"" and making much needed changes to how things are operated, but changes take far too long to be implemented.

The job responsibilities are straightforward, but they oversell the ""analyst"" portion of the job; currently it is more of a ""button-pusher"" position. To their credit, they are doing what they can to change that, but they have been working on that change for the better part of 2 years."
