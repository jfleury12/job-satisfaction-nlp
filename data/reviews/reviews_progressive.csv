I personally think he was put in that position hastily as he is not a people person and that is something you need to be when your whole team is virtual.

17,"""Good company - work life not for me""",3.0,Company cares about their employees and invests in their training and well being. Plenty of room for advancement if you enjoy working in claims and are interested in moving up the ladder.,"The nature of working claims in and of itself. You are dealing with people who are not happy with anything that you do for them. Insureds will tell you it's not their fault for an accident and lie. Claimants will demand you pay for their damages and lie. Customers don't know their own insurance policy in general. I left because of dealing with customers. This is no fault of Progressives just the nature of the job. Progressive is growing at a very high rate and the workload can be very demanding. They are hiring to meet the demand ,however, during peak season we were averaging about 8 claims a day - if you had to stay late there's no overtime because it's a salaried position. Essentially, the job is a lot of angry people calling you and thinking that they deserve the world. You are on the phone 90% of the day getting statements and ""investigating"" an accident or returning claimants messages that call you non-stop because they think they're not at fault. Overall, employees either love or hate the job.",Progressive

20,"""Great beggning into the insurance indurstry.""",4.0,"Training at Progressive Insurance Tampa/Riverview location was impressive to say the least. Trainers where very entertaining, helpful and yet still very professional and helped create a great culture for the class. To my surprise, the majority of the class, myself included, had never worked at a call center before. The first week we hit the floors, 3 people from my class size of 12 left the job. Myself, coming from the food industry, I was pretty much okay with anything that didn't involve tips or commission. This job will provide you with a great culture, decent pay depending on your perspective/budget, flexible schedule and room for change after a year on the job or so. With that said, it's still a inbound call center, and Progressive thinks they have cracked the code to the customer wallet so you WILL have to follow their method, now called the progressive ""philosophy"". Some people where fine with it, others quit because of it, either way its a great beginning. It's insurance sales, so it will become very boring very quick, and when there is down time, you have nothing to do.

Schedule has a little bit of flexibility if you need to come in late or leave early for occasional appointment. Gainshare is great bonus.,"This company has become so cheap to them point where it is rather shocking. Everyday we have more important features needed to do our job taken away from us, all so the company can save a buck. Office chairs are broken and there is a year waiting list for a new one which is insane. Workload is becoming impossible but yet all they do, in order to save money, is shift the workload around, so then a different department gets swamped. That or they come up with small ridiculous things for the cp to do which still fails to address volume. The way we are taught to negotiate claims is not realistic. If we have the authority to settle something, let us settle it. Management and supervisors desperately need to realize that they are NOT the ones that are on the phone and home constantly back and forth with these attorneys. It's a classic example of things looking much easier than they are.",Progressive
33,"""Medical Rep""",3.0,"Work from home options, no micro management , good bonuses","Getting a promotion can be difficult. They don’t care how well you perform on the job , it’s all about if you can interview well. Nepotism exist! Supervisors have no leadership experience, you work over 40 hrs per week without extra pay! People constantly go on leave due to the stress of the job. If you miss one day or get sick you will be behind. Management waits till you’re drowning in claims to step up.",Progressive
34,"""Company has the right outlook, just needs to be executed""",4.0,"Tuition reimbursement, PTO, Access to training classes, CEO is taking company in right direction. Gain share program is nice.",A lack of technical expertise with individuals. Dead wood and unmotivated employees. Due to bureaucracy of the company often times projects take much longer than they should. Also often times employees that want to work and make a difference for the company cannot do you millions of policies that prevent the person from doing their job efficiently. Not enough automation is being used or is this being pushed by management. Getting promoted can take a while even when an employee is well qualified. Also there tend to be several people who abuse the PTO policy and are not disciplined for this. Excessive absences translate into low productivity.,Progressive

Enthusiasm at the top trickles down. Lots of flexibility. Work from home options available which means, little to no stressful traffic. The day goes by extremely quickly to the point where you often say, ""where did the time go?"" Mentally stimulating.","It's a team environment in a stressful role. Helping customers in the claims environment is challenging at times. There can be a lot of ""call outs"" from peers. This role is not for the weak minded or the sensitive. You're helping people in their stressful situations- daily. So if there's a weak link in the chain on your team-it's often burdened out to the stronger links. And if you're not able to multitask efficiently- this role is not for you. Sedentary at times depending what your title is.",Progressive

39,"""Great benefits and pay, but still a high volume call center""",3.0,"***Read this review if you have time, it is pretty long. *** Great 401k match at 6%, affordable insurance packages and additional employee related benefits, affordable in-site gym, full service cafeteria are some of the amenities. Gainshare (8%+ of your earned salary for just being an employee if the company profits) Easily accessible supervisors and offline time for personal or professional development are available. Lots of company sponsored lunches. Working from home available for certain positions. Once you leave work, you leave work. You do not take anything home with you.","Behind all the smiling faces and internal support, this is still a high volume call center. I will admit, they will try to make you feel that it isn't so during training, and you may even believe it, but don't. You can expect to take up to 80 calls per day. Imagine a job where a ""slow"" day is waiting 4 or 5 minutes before you get your next call, THAT'S how busy it is on a regular basis. If you have been trained to handle specialty policies, expect no downtime. To survive Progressive, you MUST like people or have a VERY high stress tolerance. Many systems and practices are very outdated in comparison to the rest of the insurance world. It seems that every week we have to do something manually or inform the customer that we're unable to fulfill their request (in real time) because of some system issue. Progressive also does not train their agents so expect to correct a lot of mistakes, most of which end up costing the policy owner more money and you get to be the one chosen to have that conversation with them. Attendance point system is a joke. Full day absences and tardies both count as a full point, and you may only have 5 within a year before you start to receive warnings or disciplinary action. A simple ""documented conversation"" may bar you from advancement. HR does not really help if you need accommodations. Your voice does not matter in the HR world unless you are complaining about another employee. If you want any kind of accommodation; whether it be ergonomic or to save yourself from their ridiculous attendance policy, you need either an ADA form or FMLA (which you must be employed for a year or longer, and they may approve or deny at their discretion). Doctors notes don't matter. They still use STAR for career advancement to current employees.",Progressive

44,"""It's ""Mentally Taxing""""",3.0,"Decent pay, decent benefits and work from home opportunities , end of year ""gainshare""","Lack of company transparency that is committed on both employees and customers. Based on various issues associated with the business practices of Progressive, management seems to be ""brainwashed"" everything that impacts the business that they believe is a benefit, is actually a burden to both the Consultant and Customer. The company is no longer the model of its co-founder and former CEO Peter B Lewis, it has become solely about numbers, totally unreal metrics (primarily trying to push or upsell homeowners/renters insurance) but the increased focus on trying to upsell additional services to most callers who can't even pay for their current auto insurance. Basically putting your job on the line for those upsells, despite you not being licensed to or hired on for sales. You're basically being held 100% accountable and responsible for something that you only have 10% control over. They have become more about their shareholders than their employees. Plan on being stuck in whatever position you're hired into. There are very few opportunities for advancement, everything is pretty much a lateral move, at Progressive, you are more likely to move down, or move over, but rarely will you move upward in the company. If there is a chance for you to make a move you'll either be waiting 15 years to get to move or you'll be competing with 8000, other people for one available position who wants to get out the same position you're in. Also to the trained eye, you will take notice of the fact that as ethnically diverse the employee pool may be, you will take notice of the fact that above the role of supervisor A.K.A an overseer, there are absolutely NO people of color in upper management. Everyone is of caucasian persuasion. Any idea that happens to be both customer and consultant friendly,if it makes too much sense, they want no part of it. So you will find that you are only as good or valuable as you last PHA transfer. If you are hired, proceed with caution.",Progressive

They provide you with every resource possible to succeed in order to “pass” training. The CEO is extremely pleasant. The workforce is also very diverse.,"The job itself is a call center job. You are tied to your chair by your headset for your entire shift. The only reprieve you get are your legally mandated breaks which get eaten into by your bathroom breaks, of which you will take many because of the copious amount of water you will drink to ensure the integrity of your voice as you talk for hours on end. About 60% of the conversations you will have are fine, the other 40 being unpleasant or downright intolerable. Yes, it turns out people will willingly call you to scream about their poor driving record and getting a highly priced quote because of it. Unpleasant customers calling in are not necessarily the company’s fault; but their sales process that they mandate must be followed on every call no matter the circumstances exacerbated many unpleasant calls I had. Angry/inpatient potential customers are not interested in hearing about Progressive’s homeowner’s line and/or bundle opportunities - they want to get a quote and end the call.

PSP (in sales) is by far the stupidest and most meaningless thing I've ever come across. Management is full of phony smiles and high fives as a way of ""showing appreciation"" and increasing retention, but thankfully some of us see through the cracks. lest I forget, management thinks they're completely untouchable (which unfortunately they are) and seem to get away with things that are, to say the very least, unethical and probably illegal.

It does not matter which local office, that is the nature of the job. The company loves to celebrate diversity and inclusion, but in my office, diversity would mean wearing your favorite sports team which is of course, asinine. Career advancement is placed on, for the most part, how much management likes you (and nepotism) rather than your actual execution of the work. Granted, while it does play a part, management will go with ""likeability"" rather than compatibility. Definitely a glass ceiling for minorities- not so much white women. The pay is alright, the benefits are awful. I would go as uninsured to an urgent care because it was cheaper than paying what the health insurance would cover (typically $20) even with the low deductible plan.

Then after training you get sent out into the real world and quickly realize this isn’t all rainbows and butterflies. They want you to fit to their mold and they’re very smart in how they do this. They try to make it seem like you’re not working for a corporation and quickly you learn progressive is like any other corporation. If your not one who’s into being a cheerleader for a huge corporation then this job isn’t for you. I felt like my soul was dying everyday at work because of constantly getting yelled at by customers, not being able to give real reasons as to why rates went up, poor support from supervisors. It’s a numbers game and if you don’t mind that then you’ll succeed. There is a sales aspect to it too which you don’t get commission for. As time went on I started to see the real face of this company. They’ve done some cruel and shady things to my other coworkers too. It may be the place for you but if you’re an independent thinker and have a heart ... you’ll have a hard time here unless you’re able to reframe things in a lighter perspective to help you get by. I say go for the job, do the training, see what it’s about because pay is good but don’t be upset with yourself if you get to a point where you feel depressed or like you’re not doing good enough. It’s not you and tones of us feel that way and it’s okay it takes a certain personality to thrive in a place like that. Or you may find you actually love it and more power to you !

Its gotten to the point where everyone is always in the office, often late at night and on Saturdays. When you do that for a couple of years in a salaried position, you eventually feel taken advantage of. I think burnout is widespread in a lot of departments in the company.

They treat customers, body shops and anyone who has a difference of opinion like complete garbage. I drove over 4 hours every day, working 12 hours every day with no paid overtime and micro managed. There were some areas in the country that it was better working conditions, but overall, it is a company who run as far from the golden rule as they can despite what they will tell you. I likely would have been diagnosed as clinically depressed. I am so blessed that I escaped that company and found greener pastures. Parts usage is a joke here. Repair times are a joke. Cycle time is a joke and includes weekends. I was told to tell body shops that the large jobs will soak up the cycle time of the small jobs where a 4 hour job on a friday dropoff needs to be done on friday, per the system. I would receive spreadsheets of network shop results statewide, and nearly every shop statewide would be in the red. The shops were the problem, not the expectations. The dollar is valued first and foremost, people are on the bottom of the value system here. While I made a lot of money in those 12 years and may have boosted my financial success in life, it was a career waste. If you are seeking a company with ethics, integrity, morals or other worthy attributes, look elsewhere. Also, their HR department is management support and that is all.

I understand if people were missing work repetitively for no reason, but they don’t excuse any absence and it counts as an “occurance” against you no matter if you miss 15 mins or the entire shift which counts negatively towards you keeping your job. The training for this job claims to be very in depth but they provide you with little to know information for weeks and then drop you into the environment and expect you to know what you’re doing. They spend the entire first week of being hired there in training attempting you to drink the Progressive kool-Aid, stating that the company is diverse, ethical, and everyone has an open-door policy but that is also a lie.

They expect you to upsell the home insurance no matter what the customers situation, even if they’re calling to report a 5 car pile up they were a part of or if they’re calling to remove a driver due to death, it’s immoral and unethical and when you bring it up they preach to you that it’s not “selling” insurance, it’s “educating the customer,” but then instruct you how to “overcome the customers objectives” which is a textbook sales technique. The agents who sell the insurance can’t do their jobs correctly so you’re constantly fixing their mistakes (often illegal ones) while being berated by a customer.

You can also dress like a slob. Typical benefits","Do not believe them when they say that people walk themselves out and that is why the turnover is so high. The turnover is high because the good workers realize that in Austin, you can find a way better job where you are treated like a human. Supervisors play favoritism. They do promote that you can advance your career here, but unless you are a favorite of your supervisor, you're not advancing. Supervisors refuse to answer questions but instead just refer you to the ""guidelines"" even if its not in there or you do not understand it. You take an average of 80-100 calls back to back a day mostly of people yelling at you because their insurance rates are going up and then are expected to ask them multiple times to buy homeowners insurance in the same call. If you do not ask them more than 2 times in a call, than you fail on the metric. My Supervisor would constantly not be there and get angry if you asked a question while he was there. He would always brag about working there for 20 years, but did not know how to do the job. His answer for everything was either “send an email to assist” or “go look at guidelines”. He would never take the time to explain or work with me. How am I expected to do a job when my so called leader couldn't/wouldn't do the job? He would only meet with with me once every couple of months and during those meeting, he spend the entire meeting puting me down for not having a higher metric even though I was above goal. He only cared about how he looked in front of his management. He would often take his favorites off the phone and let them sit at his desk for hours without taking a call so they could protect their metrics. After I talked to HR about his behavior, he would use firing as a motivator every chance.

Those who complain about being micro-managed must not be open to coaching and helpful suggestions to help their service skills. People who say it’s hard to move around or up in this business must not realize that you have to show you’re the right candidate for the position you want. They won’t just place someone in a position because that person wants it… they must have the skills, personality, and resume to back up that application. That’s how this company has done so well for so long. There are also some who complain about not having a work/life balance at Progressive. Again, I don't know where they get that from. They strongly discourage you from taking anything home for extra review/study and want you to keep work at work. They never tell you to take work home with you, even if you work from home. If you remember to take it one call at a time, one policy at a time, are open to coaching and improvement opportunities, and keep a mentality of providing service to others, you’ll do really well here. If you’re looking for “just a job,” you’ll want to look somewhere else.",Not every entry-level representative has their heart fully in what they do here.,Progressive

Terrible Management. It’s difficult to express how terrible the supervisors are in such a short space. 2. Constantly Changing Policies. Change can be good and it’s good to be able to be adaptive and “progressive.” However, it’s not good to arbitrarily change things like highlighting the flexibility and work-from-home aspect of a position and then deciding it would be an in-office position and only giving employers a few weeks notice. 3. Unrealistic Workload. The volume of the work you are expected to complete is unrealistically high. Supervisors hinder your progress instead of assisting you. Upper management raves about how much growth there is and at the same time, they refuse to hire additional people to help and pretend that the workload hasn’t increased. 4. Discriminatory Hiring and Advancement Policies. During my time in the Tennessee office, I saw racial discriminatory hiring practices. There is enough evidence there that Progressive would have a very difficult time fighting a lawsuit. There is also an argument to be made for age discrimination as well as most of the employees are young. There are virtually no older employees. 5. All of the “best work place” activities and “best company culture” is just talk and is just for show. Your immediate supervisor will spend most of their time planning games to play, “diversity” day activities (which is comical since Progressive doesn’t have a diverse work staff), or an after-hours bar trip instead of actually working or assisting you with your work. You are then expected to bring in food for a potluck, play games for an hour or two and then you’re chastized when your work for the day isn’t completed.",Progressive

There is not enough consistent alignment between the many different organizations your state can have in terms of how their area handles something, yet you need to take claims from all these organizations territories whether you are based there or not. Far to often you hear a role in an organization doesn't perform certain responsibilities of a claim, even though it is written within their job responsibilities and expectations.

You are required to meet a quota for cross selling which I wasn't really told until training. Even when callers are upset and angry that their rates have gone up when they haven't have any accidents or tickets you are still expected to cross sell. The rates are also always going up so callers are always complaining about it. Snapshot is a hassle... Customer consultants are expected to assist callers with their questions about it even when they don't provide legit training for it. There is a snapshot team but for some reason they are reluctant to talk to the callers themselves and just relay the information to you instead of taking over the call. The online system is a joke... A lot of people don't use computers and when they call in for help getting their esign documents completed for their ""discount"" you are expected to walk them through the process when you cannot see their screen LOL.

Little freedom to do your work without tight micromanagement. Micromanagement is systemic through the software supervisors use which forces them to micromanage and get into claim files. Internal competition is very strongly pushed which takes away from opportunities to help each other out as we are graded on beating out a coworker. The company has an aggressive approach towards comparative negligence and finds much more significant comparative negligence on claimants than most competitors.

I was hired on at $52,000 with zero insurance experience, handed keys to a 2017 Ford Escape, a new laptop and new cell phone on day one.... Sounds amazing, right? Then you go to training. Your first 8-12 weeks with the company you will be in “training”. This is in one of 4 places, Cleveland, Austin, Tampa or Tempe AZ. You’re there a min or two weeks straight usually and as much as 6 weeks depending on your local manager. The training staff of Progressive truly cares and enjoys their jobs, and that shows. Imagine having to onboard upwards of 200+ new employees every two weeks, most of whom are in their early 20’s. Yikes. While at “training” you’re basically given the run of whatever city you’re in (Cleveland for me). You’re treated pretty darn good, given tours of the main campus, you meet the CEO, and are 100% “sold” on the company. You’re given a rental car, a cash card with $450 on it and set free after 5pm daily. It’s amazing some of these kids don’t die during the course of training. My training in Cleveland was 100% positive, and I graduated in both of my classes in the top 2%, and seemed destined for a long career with Pro. Keep in mind I have had only 3 jobs in my life (40y.o.) and thought I would retire from Progressive. I LOVED this company until I got back to my local city and was under local management. See cons...","Workload, local/regional management. I loved everything about this company until I was put under local management. My manager was completely new to the position, ignorant to what employees needed, stubborned and downright hateful when asked questions or challenged in ANY way. God forbid someone 10+ years older have an opinion.... Progressive LOVES 20 something’s that haven’t developed an opinion of the world, and that was all of my coworkers. Do not take this job if you’re headstrong and have an opinion. You will be continually stifled and ridiculed until you quit. And this is coming from someone in retail management for 20 years... They preach Work/Life balance, but not a day passed that I wasn’t making calls or dealing with estimates WAY past the 5pm hour, and many many times on my “weekends”. If I decided I wanted to enjoy my “weekend” and pushed off “work” on a Saturday, I would be buried on the following Monday with little chance to get though the workload I had. After 4 months of this hell, I literally just didn’t show up one Monday. Covertly I dropped off all my Progressive related gear, car, laptop, phone etc at the local office and just quit. It was THAT bad. I’m 40. I’ve NEVER quit a company not even at 16 years old, without at least two weeks notice, but when you are just bullied and treated like garbage by your direct boss, sometimes you have to do what you have to do.",Progressive

This job is frustration because the systems are extremely outdated and they crash often. Customers are transferred and bounced around like ping pong balls and this frustration eventually gets taken out on you. A lot of programs aren't integrated. You are expected to upsell products you have 0 knowledge about (General liability) and customers will ask you questions about General liability, personal auto insurance, home owners, billing, claims, etc. You aren't trained on any of these and you end up looking incompetent to the caller. The pay is enough to keep you here, but it's not enough compensation to put up with for how often we get hollered at on the phone or how often system errors occur. You are not given software or knowledge adequate enough to successfully help the customers.

They tell you to work on your efficiency rather than adequately staffing the organization. Leadership conferences happen every year, but they're notoriously for the leaders to be out of the office for two days, get drunk and hook up on the company's dime. The leaders only know that they go home on time and they get any vacation approved that they want. Meanwhile, with diminished staff, they approve anyone and everyone's vacation demands.

They even allow you to have a side gig, as long as it does not conflict with your position.","I was very excited when I was accepted into the Sales Consultant training program at Progressive. I thought that they had been in business long enough to have a highly effective and polished training program. However, I have been extremely disappointed in the chaotic instruction and poor management that I have encountered over the course of training. Too often, I have been reprimanded for procedures and policies that I was never trained on -- even to the extent of formal written warnings. Also, on countless occasions, I have asked for instruction and received three different answers from three diffierent coaches/ supervisors. And to top it all off, they issue reprimands and warnings for obeying one trainer's instructionl instead of the other. Not only is there no consistency in training, but there is favortism that clouds management. Several times I have seen the top selling consultants break rules to make their numbers and management simply looks the other way. Unless you are willing to brown nose management or bully callers into buying coverage that they don't understand and is overpriced beyond budget, you will not succeed at Progressive. They pretend that you have the opportunity to own your call, but they prevent consultants from transferring callers to the agent that they request. This is not a company that provides job security. In fact, at one point, almost half of the new hires walked away frustrated, or were pushed out of the door with mounting reprimands for lack of training.",Progressive

But because of that they fired me. Instead of just explaining it was wrong I was out the door. I was told there was nothing they could do they didn't have the power to say I could stay because it was morally wrong of me(even though it was the main managers of my branch). Later a teammate called me up and said they brought him in the office for the same thing but just gave him a warning. I feel they discriminated against my sex and age. Why did an older man that had been there same amount of time as me get to keep his job but I was fired. I wound up losing everything because of that. I had stopped going to vet tech school to pursue this. After I lost my job my relationship fell apart, then my car got repossessed (my parents had co-signed so they didn't even want to talk to me) then I lost my apartment. And the whole time all I could think of was the manager as she walked me out saying keep your chin up. It was taunting me.

Additionally, I took this job in the call center because I couldn't seem to get an interview anywhere else within the company. The gentleman who interviewed me told me I wouldn't be there long as my qualifications would lead to internal promotions within the year - wrong. My supervisor refuses to advise me on moving up, stating that I am not meeting the expectations of the job I currently have. Just because I cannot meet specific metrics in this job does not mean I wouldn't excel at other positions within the company. Heres the thing though: I am trying. I do everything I've been coached, I make an effort in every call, and there's really no criticism you can give if I AM TRYING. and my metrics are still bad.

897,"""Some positives, mostly negatives - Claims Representative""",1.0,"End of year bonus (but they could just pay us adequately and you only get this if you are still working there on Dec 1st of that year). Some flexibility in scheduling - used to be way better. You usually have to start with at least one weekend day and they tend to do nonconsecutive days off. But in my department, you can submit for a schedule change within 6 months. If call volume allows, you can change your schedule. They don't do you any favors. If you are extremely lucky, you will submit for a m-f schedule at the right time! If we are slow, you can submit for a ""green alert"" and they will maaaaaaybe let you leave early. You can choose to use your vacation hours for the time you leave early or you can just not pay yourself for those hours. Its hard to get a day off around holidays and weekends are hard to get off too. But otherwise, its not too bad. They want to promote people within the company, but only to other terrible on the phone positions. The training positions are the most coveted and next are the supervisor positions. They are rarely available and you will have lots of competition. They have started promoting work from home because they ran out of space. Everything they do, they pretend its of their employees but really its for their own benefit. The benefits aren't bad. You will pay about $180 a month for health insurance. They just increased the deductible to $600. Its with Aetna. If you go in network, health providers have a discounted rate for Aetna, but you will basically pay the entire cost of the service until you reach your ded. Afterwards, you will pay a 20% copay. They have a 6% match on a 401K. If you save up 5,000 in your 401K, when you eventually quit from extreme burnout, you can leave it in there! Obviously no more matching when you no longer work there. They have discounts for different companies like rental companies, etc. Have yet to use any of these. You also get $50 for every 6 months if you have Progressive Insurance. When you donate thru their giving website, Progressive will match your donation. So that's nice! They will hire without a college degree. They somehow get everyone to drink the koolaide and believe that Progressive is one of the best places to work in Austin.","Totally corporate atmosphere. Every minute is accounted for. There were years when they were severely under staffed and I would take calls for 7.5 hours a day (this is when i was full time). You only get a 15 minute break if you work 4 hours, which is basically the time it takes to use the bathroom in those 4 hours. Call volume has slowed down recently, but you are lucky if you get 2 minutes between calls. If you go over your break time or lunch time, your stats will show it. They also want your calls to be like 6-9 minutes while still giving excellent customer service. hahaha. No. That's how customer service works. The higher ups are putting lots of pressure on the supervisors so they are putting lots of pressure on their reps. They make you start all of your systems before you shift starts so that you can log in and start taking calls on the dot, or it will hurt your stats. As an hourly employee, I would think this is illegal. You will be the public's punching bag. They don't think you are smart enough to know when it is ok to hang up on someone (even if they are screaming expletives at you) so they tell you that if you hang up anyone they will immediately fire you. If you go off script, like you're a human and not a robot, you have to fight for your way of doing things. They have ""pilot programs"" where they don't pay you more because its just a ""pilot"" but you have more work. They try to twist things and make it seem like Austin never gets pilot programs (we do) and how honored we should be. There were some years that I only got like a .19 raise but on average for the time I've been here, its been a $1 raise. Even if you like people and customer service, you will burn out pretty soon. If you aren't sure what to do with your career, I would advise working as an administrative assistant for similar pay and health insurance. Less stress. Less yelling. Less corporate bs. Also, even if a customer is mentioning how worried they are that their car is non drivable and you see that they have rental on their policy, you aren't suppose to let them know because they should ""already know what's on their policy"". I find this to be shoddy business practices. The higher ups are the higher ups because they have been with Progressive for something like 20-30 years.

1063,"""Entry Level for Life""",3.0,"This job offered a decent entry level salary for me while I was still in college. The cost of health care and other benefits was very reasonable. They offered 100% matching up to 6% for your 401K. While I was there the minimum starting wage was increased by $1 for new employees in the same position, so they increased it for current employees as well. There is tuition reimbursement, three weeks of paid vacation/sick time combined (not front loaded), and performance based scheduling that you bid for. There was also an on site gym that could be paid for via payroll deduction of $10 per paycheck, and it had free group fitness classes and was open 23 hours a day. Personal training was extremely discounted. The training for the role was quite extensive and prepared me very well for the position, and there were several cultural groups you could join.","This is a very busy call center. My lowest call volume was 80 calls answered a day and on busier days I have gotten over 120 depending on call length with three seconds between calls. Sick time is included in the three weeks of vacation, but if you have to use sick time without getting it approved as time off (at least 24 hours in advance) it counts against your performance for picking schedules. I had to leave early one time because I starting getting a migraine and was dizzy and vomiting, and I had all the vacation time to cover the three hours left in my shift. When I came to work the next time I got written up for it. I otherwise had perfect attendance for 18 of the 19 months I worked there. This honestly made me very angry. I did not have a pattern of behavior for leaving work or calling off. This was the only case. For promotions they definitely value tenure over a college degree, which in some cases is fine. A lot of people moved on from the company because of this, though.

""outside"" reps get to make their own hours. They like diversity, with special ""clubs"" for certain races and homosexuals, very ""PRO"" everything, very liberal. This can get you promoted quickly. They are very socially aware and want to be everything to everyone.","Ready for the truth? 10+ year employee. I have seen over 100 people come and go in my small office. I have seen the ENTIRE multi department/level management fired in one month. I have seen massive growth in the company. Sadly, I see the greed. Over the last 10 + years the company has had major restructuring. With this came changes year after year that effect the possibility and growth of employees. Inconceivable models for objectives and employee evaluation. Impossible metric measurements and requirements all of which prevent growth as a career. I see supervisors with a 3rd of the tenure I have only because they live in another metro or state area and got promoted, but have no idea what they are doing. I see management restructuring that creates a ladder impossible to climb. The pay and benefits are just enough to keep you there, but the micro management will make you want to leave. It is insane how hard management makes this job. Constant process change, information is force fed via emails with no time to review it. Process, guidelines, and hard rules create wars with repair facilities and customers. Oh, we are all about the customer, right? Ask Flo. We could care less unless its a paying policy holder, then we have to practically attempt to seduce them and become facebook buddies with every paying customer. The non paying or claimants are ignored. Its all about numbers, metrics, and the most ridiculous customer survey system that directly effects the employee evaluation, promotion or financial compensation increases. For a select few, reps like me, who can get to a certain level, its good compensation with the bonus, which is the only reason many employees put up with the job. Management are insanely compensated in a bonus structure.. as most have been there forever. Its all about the $, never forget that part. Its a for-profit company, shocker, I know. Employees were at one time valued, now we are just robots, just another employee number. Lastly, it depends on where you are located, as even though its the same company nationwide, it is managed vastly differently everywhere.

While the workload can be difficult to manage at times, this is not really what I'm talking about (though as a newer rep, I had to consistently clock in overtime hours to keep up or get caught up). Split schedules are a requirement when you sign on as a call center adjuster with Progressive, but management makes it seem as though eventually, you will be able to request a more traditional schedule. I have not found this to be the case and I have worked in this organization for two years. In fact, one of my coworkers recently celebrated her five-year anniversary with Progressive and only JUST got weekends off, the great white whale of a CCU rep. Even applying to work one weekend day and one weekday off in a row (i.e. having Friday and Saturday off and working Sunday or Sunday and Monday off and working Saturday) is denied for some mysterious ""business need"" that is never elaborated on. Additionally, the attendance policy needs to be tweaked slightly. While now there is a sliding schedule that allows for tardiness to be made up for (as long as you are clocked in within 30 minutes of your shift start), a late arrival or early quit is equal to an unexpected absence. If you are sick, or if you have something suddenly come up and you are not pre-approved for time off well in advance (and time off is difficult to obtain on Mondays, Fridays and Saturdays), you can quickly find yourself barred from advancement opportunities until infractions begin dropping off ONE YEAR LATER. If you have a particularly rough go of it with illness or family issues or anything that has you unexpectedly late, leaving early, or being absent entirely, there is not much you can do but wait out the marks against your record. It's disheartening at best and crushing at worst, especially if you're a capable and high-performing candidate whose career aspirations are put on hold because of unforeseen circumstances.",Progressive

I remember a senoir claims adjuster telling me how he had got an MBA while working at Progressive and his supervisor told him that while that was good it wouldnt do anything to help him advance his career at Progressive.

When I began I was excited and looking forward to the modest pay bump this job offered compared to my previous job as a paralegal at a mid-sized firm. Within months everything changed as the claims piled on and Progressive's unrealistic version of a normal workload became clear. Within a relatively short period of time, you'll find yourself working 12 hour days, coming in early and staying late and coming in on weekends not even to catch up, but to be LESS far behind. It doesn't matter how organized you are or how good your time management skills are, you won't be able to keep up with the ridiculous volume of claims that flood in. Progressive is big on 'setting expectations' i.e. following up with customers but you won't be able to keep your commitments. Most of my coworkers are good people but almost everyone is miserable due to the workload. My supervisor openly admits that Progressive hires 'behind the curve.' Everyone who has been in claims for any number of years knows the truth - they have unrealistic expectations and know they are chronically understaffed. Those who hang on get promoted, only to have a different version of the same insane volume thrown at them along with ridiculous metrics. It's your classic publicly held company that only cares about the bottom line and meeting quarterly numbers to keep investors happy. Work environment is absolutely miserable other than being surrounded by generally good people to lean on and share in the misery. You will be blamed by upset customers for things entirely out of your control and hate just about every day of work. 'Find a job you'll love' is their current tag line for recruiting and my recommendation would be steer clear of a job in claims at Progressive entirely unless you have no other viable options. When one factors in all the overtime you have to put in, the pay is SIGNIFICANTLY less than jobs with comparable levels of responsibility and problem-solving skills required to be proficient.

You will never be told what your score is but it's another reason that you want to be a favorite because if your VAT is low and business slows down guess who is getting cut. Sad part is....you never even knew it existed. Pay raises are terrible except for claims managers and up...expect 1 or 2 percent. They will tell you advancement is the key to more money and you have to pay your dues(means 60 Hrs a week). You might achieve the next level but honestly it's doubtful.

Compensation is a little low for the industry, however if the company did well the difference was made up that year by gainsharing.

The food is terrible, and the building itself is ghetto and falling apart and often smells like sewage.They have construction crews working around the clock. The building is sinking into an old landfill. The call volume is very high. You take nonstop calls from the time you get there until you leave. I averaged 100-120 calls a day. Customers are very rude and angry because of constant rate increases. The company is focused on nothing but numbers. Providing good customer service means nothing. It's all about selling even as a customer service role. The company is extremely unorganized and none of the supervisors seem to know what they are doing or what is going on. Everybody there complains constantly and hates their jobs. The on-site doctor prescribes anti depressants and anxiety medications to just about everyone for any issue. HR manager was HORRIBLE! He didn't do anything for the employees. Only for the company. Total lack of courage. Supervisors are very unprofessional and often act inappropriately with employees and rely on their employees to do all of their work.

Progressive is a good place to get your feet wet in the insurance claims industry, especially for a field adjuster and those who want to make the transition from the auto body/repair/estimator side of the process to claims. That said, Claims are NOT for everyone, you need thick skin and to be able to think on your toes day-to-day. The biggest issue most people working here agree on: there are too many managers who frankly do not understand what it takes to repair a vehicle/RV/boat/motorcycle to ""pre-loss"" condition using industry standard techniques, and that is where many disagreements arise. Most customers are also fairly vehicle savvy, and you will get more than your fair share of kick back from them day to day, especially when you don't pay what their chosen repair shop asks, and/or if you deny any damages (which is fairly often). This is a large company, therefore, the claims volume is high. Most of your day will be spent in the company car, driving from claim to claim, and on the phone making calls to shops, customers and parts suppliers. You will work overtime when the need arises, as well as through lunch (if you get one. Bring some snacks that won't spoil like cereal bars or Trail-mix for those days). There will be occasional days though when you do get to go home early- IF you get all of your work done, but they would like for you to ""just do one more inspection today"". Then that becomes the norm. Management watches all your numbers constantly, from the time you start the 1st assignment, to how many vehicles you inspect per day, to how much you pay for repairs down to individual parts prices. If you don't like being micromanaged you will not like the job- plain and simple. You will argue with management over $1 on a claim if they feel it was not a needed expense, even if the customer gives you a great satisfaction score on the claim. Word to the wise: document every decision you make, someone is always auditing your work. Most days you will go home with a headache, worn out, and looking forward to the weekend. I was bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for the 1st year, but after 3, I just couldn't do it anymore. There are those who have been in the role for 15+ years, but that's because they have the personalities that this company looks for.

See the ""Cons"" section for further details.","I worked in sales, so I will keep my comments, for the most part, directed to that skill set. In sales, we all know that price is the driving factor, when selling ""air."" What I mean by that is you are not selling anything tangible. The customer cannot touch it, see it, taste it or smell it. Insurance, of any type, is that way. The customer gets documents which are usually glanced over, then filed away, never again to see the light of day until renewal time, or accident time.

Easier said than done, but if you are one of the 'gifted' people who can do that, this is the job for you. ""Impossible metrics"". Now I've seen that phrase bandied about on these reviews and, while Progressive does set the bar high...really high...I have seen many reps meet and exceed them, so looking at that from a company perspective, my answer is...""If John, Sue, Jimmy and Darla can do it, then it can be done."" Face it. That is true of any company. It's all about the numbers, baby!! Get used to it, because THAT is corporate 'Merica now.

I have seen a manager who was sucked up by the IT employee referring the team member for promotion with achievements of proficiency in Excel and word document.

Management went from a customer-focused mentality to making all employees slaves to the metrics. In the beginning of my career, the company used metrics to locate outliers and then manage those who were in this category. For example, someone with too high of aux time would have their manager work with them to figure out why their aux time was so high (training issue, laziness, lack of understanding of procedures, etc). Near the end of my career, the company changed its attitude to force employees to work toward the metrics. It became a boiler room call center much like the majority of other call centers out there. The culture is strongly supportive of pro-liberal causes, most notably support for GLBT causes. This is fine, until you have an employee that does not wish to participate in it. The company sent out ""ally cards"", where you had to sign the card saying that you would not discriminate against or treat someone badly because of their sexual orientation, and that you would support the agenda of the GLBT community. Those that refused were subject to ""constructive termination"", where they make you so miserable you want to quit (instead of firing you, where they have to pay unemployment). There was also no equal rights on the clothes you wear or the way you decorate your cubicle.

The management is so afraid of getting bad scores and being relieved of command they make all kinds of crazy decisions to try and ""save the survey"" and so we end up paying for things that should have probably been denied for mechanical failure or not being related to the claim in the first place.

They live and breathe those surveys and all rules go out the window if that survey score can be increased -Not a lot of opportunity for advancement, unless you want to move to Cleveland (and who wants to do that?) . There are many jobs at their corporate headquarters in Cleveland, but again....who wants to do that? -Progressive Claims is a very process-oriented department.

Don't then give out my bad measurements to the team (and vice-versa) and claim you are doing it to create healthy competition. It's a jerk move. -Progressive restructures their organization every few years. Basically, management gets top-heavy so they demote and/or let go many managers. In a few years, they see that each manager has too many direct reports, so they do a mass manager hiring. Then a few years later they again see ""too many managers"" and repeat this process.

These opportunities are few and far between because it is left up to manager discretion as to whether their department can ""handle"" the work arrangement. In one position at Progressive, I worked 4 10 hour days. When I moved to another position (a promotion), I was not allowed to work the same schedule. One employee in an office of 30-40 had a part-time schedule and another has been repeatedly denied part-time (I can't vouch for that employee's work product, so I don't know if there is any reason behind it). -Claims employees work holidays (when other insurance companies are closed) and Saturdays. What is silly about working these days is that bodyshops aren't open, rental car places aren't open, police departments aren't open (to get reports), so you basically call the customer to tell them you'll have to call them back the next business day to do anything on their claim.

It is busy. All the time. Calls are back to back, with 5 seconds between calls. Your aux time (time not on a call) is very closely watched. You are required to do sales pitches on most calls, even though it's a customer service position and are punished if not enough of your customers buy in. There are strict guidelines that you must follow for every call. And you can not deviate from them. This requires you to be constantly looking at them, without committing them to memory.

If you don't eat sleep and breathe Progressive and LOVE every minute - good or bad - you'll have no career. They want yes-workers, no one with ideas or out of the box thinking. This company definitely falls prey to its own success...Progressive is so large, that they have absolutely lost touch with their base workers. Every other person I know that works in insurance outside of Progressive makes more. Usually quite a bit more. Annual salary reviews are usually a joke, and can oftentimes be insulting. They do not recognize the experience and merits of some of their more tenured reps. Local management will not stand behind you in decisions you make, and I don't know if that's out of fear from corporate, or sheer apathy. It's unfortunate that I'm looking outside of Progressive, because I feel that I AM a valuable employee (and I still like my coworkers), but I don't feel valued at all.

There is an implicit glass ceiling that analysts frequently hit after 4-5 years with Progressive where they are expected to obtain an MBA in order to advance further. The problem is that Progressive offers little in the way of education assistance and places very little value on MBAs earned at institutions outside of the top-tier. This means that you’re basically expected to quit your job, obtain an MBA on your own, and then reapply for a higher level position (Product Manager or similar). While I had access to senior management from my first year, this is extremely unusual. Low level analysts typically have little opportunity to interact with senior management which can exacerbate the feelings of disconnect. Also, salary progression can be extremely slow unless you're one of the top performers or take advantage of negotiation opportunities when you change jobs. Most concerning, the company has been going through a lot of changes lately and the decisions and plans have been poorly communicated to employees leading to a lot of uncertainty, unrest and resentment.

When I got done with that class, I went back to my work station and saw that I still had been assigned a full days worth of claims that I had to work.

However, the amount of support you get in any of these situations is actually quite impressive. This truly is a place where everyone's opinion is valued and that your unique thoughts are incorporated into how the company does business. The career pathing particularly with indivudual managers is very good. As an employee you spend a very reasonable amount of time talking with management to determine where you will go next. It is the support and inclusiveness of the organization which make it a truly great place to work.","Progressive frequently suffers from a lack of visionary or strategic leadership. Most decisions are made very tactically which can lead to suboptimal results. Because the culture is so focused on analysis and quanititative skills, it can be hard for someone without those skills to be taken seriously or given opportunity. There is also a tendency to make quick judgements of data that, while statistically significant, does not feel right. This leads us to always stay down a consistent path, but not reward or recognize people who are willing to try something new and learn by failing. Additionally, the compensation for the amount of work that is required of you is severly lacking. Salaried employees frequently spend 7 days a week working and are paid rather low for what they contribute.",Progressive

Career opportunities are available if you have the flexibility to move within the United States. My vacation and time off benefits are very flexible. I have the ability to request time off and know that if I do go on vacation, my job can be managed by someone else while I am gone.","There are some instances of unfairness in promotions and salaries based on being ""liked"" vs. actual job effectiveness.",Progressive
2227,"""Progressive offers good career opportunities, but over time it has become more bureaucratic and risk averse.""",4.0,"For an industry that most people perceive as being very bureaucratic and stodgy, the work environment at Progressive is quite the opposite. On a scale of Google to GM, Progressive definitely leans more toward Google. Progressive offers a really positive work environment for its employees with a tremendous opportunity for growth and movement within the company. In fact, the company encourages its employees to work in different parts of the company throughout their career. The marketing group is given a great deal of latitude in terms of managing their employees, so it's easy to establish a good working relationship with your manager that suits both of your styles. Generally, if you need to work from home every now and then, that's not a problem. Taking time off is simply a matter of giving your manager a heads up a few days in advance. Performance evaluations are conducted annually, and most managers make an effort to prioritize your personal career goals along with those of the job when constructing objectives. While analysts are not offered stock options, all employees participate in a companywide ""Gainsharing"" program. Depending on your position and the company's performance each year, you can receive a certain percentage of your annual salary as a year-end bonus. If you like data analysis, Progressive is a great company to work for. Nearly every decision is driven by extensive statistical analysis, and those who know how to access and manipulate that data are rewarded as such and can go far in the company. Lastly, work-life balance at Progressive is excellent. I rarely found myself working more than 50 hours/week, and I generally left my work at work. You'll certainly find longer days in the ranks of upper management, but at the analyst level it is very reasonable.","Progressive isn't as edgy as their name implies. Out of the box ideas aren't as welcome as they used to be, and most decisions are made with an air of conservatism. The CBA tends to have the final say in all decision making. The trailblazing spirit that helped make Progressive such a success seems to be stifled. The company really plays up the idea of an internal career track from analyst to product manager, but in my time there I didn't see much follow through. A couple senior analysts eventually became product managers, but the majority of PMs are recruited from Top 10 b-schools. The management style at Progressive differs significantly between groups, so some people have amazing experiences, while others have miserable ones. Understanding the dynamic of your work group is critical in that regard.",Progressive

Also, there are many well knowledgeable professionals to learn from. Used to be a 'fun' place to work and learn. From what I hear, it isn't anymore.","Overkill by management and bureaucracy. Some good and a few excellent managers exist, but they are heavily outnumbered by people of dubious experience and extreme lack of understanding of the application of technology.

There are so many different avenues to get into within the company. It's no secret that Progressive spends a lot of money on training good people. It's the reason we have scouts constantly looking to steal away our talent. Senior management recognizes that people are people outside of the workforce. We come together inside the office as one big team and leave outside differences behind us.","If you work in claims, the workload can be very intense. It's pretty much a product of ""Corporate America"" to be pushed and prodded with the words ""accuracy"" and ""efficiency"" so Progressive is not alone.

The benefits package you can sign up for is very good, perhaps the best perk. The company has discounts with companies such as Ford, Dell, Cingular, Verizon, etc., so that helps in getting items everybody needs day to day.","However, when it comes to recognition and compensation for a good job, that's where the company falls apart. Employy Tom exceeds all his expectations and works extra hours and does his best to make trhe company and the customers happy.

Employee Tom gets a 3% raise at the end of the year for his hard endeavors! Employee Bob gets a 3% raise at the end of the year for his hard endeavors!

My office is a great office. I get along with everyone in my office. Everyone enjoys each other's company. There are some options for job diversity such as being on the catastrophe response team. If you're chosen, you can go to headquarters for 3 weeks and work catastrophe claims. It's 21 days straight, one day at the beginning and end for travel and only one day off in the middle of the rotation there. Other than that, you're working 7:45am-7pm. It's a long hard schedule, but it's an opportunity to make some extra money if you're willing to put your life on hold for almost a month. Locally there are some promotional opportunities like handling injuries and property damage estimates and repairs. Sometimes those positions are sparse.","The workload can be absurd, and the job gets old fast. Everyday is stressful because you're dealing with people's lives. You've got the parties' demands from the claims you get assigned, and you've got management cracking the whip as they monitor numbers all day long. More tenured reps are able to accomplish work faster (and they seem the handle the pressure easier). Once you've been there 3-4 years you've got it down. For someone who is still in his first two years, I've pretty much had enough of the job. I dread going to work, and when I'm there I feel stuck in the perpetual cycle of doing the same thing over and over again, day in and day out, hearing the same stories and dealing with the same drama. The job doesn't change. It's stress everyday, dealing with people's problems and making big decisions that affect people, and it's the same repeat of the same scenario everyday. The job doesn't change. Further, you're in a cube all day long, stuck to a phone and a computer. This is a soul-killing job for someone who needs more creativity and liberty in the job he or she performs. I've gone out of my way to show interest in promotion and to learn new aspects of the company, and the response I keep getting from management is promises that always fall through. I am not one of those employees looking for an easy job, and who is too lazy to accomplish a job. I stay late most days, and I consistently meet my goals. I've volunteered to do a lot of extra functions to prove myself to management, more than what others have done on my team, and I still get looked over. After over a year and a half, I feel chewed up and spit out and totally unappreciated. I was beaten out of a promotion by a guy who has been here only six months. It takes more than six months to get the job down. But he got the job because he interviewed better than I did, but he never had files reviewed because he was so new to the job. His work was never proven. It was just because he interviewed better. The response the supervisor gave me for not getting the job was total nonsense. He used my words against me to make me sound like I don't have enough customer service experience and that I don't know how to make decisions. Me and the other candidate both shared our interview experience, and from his answers he gave the safest, vaguest answers I've ever heard for an interview. I assumed wrong when I thought they were looking for substance and motivation. That's the problem with this company. They look at everything like a number instead of looking at the reality of how things really are. If it doesn't match up to their computation, it's no good. So robotic. I'm at the point where I don't want to give anything extra for this company because they don't appreciate it. Promotions are few and far between, and they play favorites. When talking to my supervisor about a claim, I have been shut down on the spot like, ""I don't want to hear it."" But another rep will walk up to her cube not long after me, and she'll listen to him for over five minutes. I would recommend getting this job for a year or two for the experience, and start looking for a job as soon as you get this one unless you're good at stomaching the Kool-Aid and can come to work for the same stressful scenario everyday and always feel like you're behind in your work.",Progressive
