I had worked over a year with Publix. At the beginning, working 39.9 hr weeks, but that's not full time. (That's Publix part time hours.) Finally I agreed to a program that would insert me into management. After being shipped from store to store in my local area I got full time. But according to Publix, since I hadn't work one full-time year my vacation hours were just on loan. So when I used them and then gave my two weeks a couple months later (to relocate out of state to take care of my elderly grandmother) they sent me a bill for the hours I owed. Untaxed hours. So, essentially, the last week of my two weeks was paying back my debt/vacation to Publix. I would not be getting a final pay check. I was working for free. 10hr days with no break--because this is Publix and breaks are a luxury. (And while I was full time and supposed to get an hour long break, my boss, at this particular store, set it up that when we did get breaks, we only got thirty minute breaks. A crime all on its own.) But even working that final week, I couldn't pay back all of my debt because they untaxed the hours of my vacation, making it near impossible for me to quit the system of Publix. (It made me feel like an indentured servant. Require to work when I shouldn't have to.) Oh they also never gave my father his bereavement when his brother died (the man who had been taking care of my grandmother) and then sent him a similar bill after he quit to relocate and take care of his mother. Because Publix--where shopping is a pleasure, but working there is a nightmare (once you take your rose colored glasses off). George Jenkins is spinning in his grave with how you are running this place Todd. Publix is in great need of a Union. The things they get away with are criminal.

Essentially you end up doing the job of the technician and pharmacist but only being compensated for pharmacist pay. Expected to finish all of your work without a technician and not leave any work behind so many days you end up coming in an hour early and leaving 1-2 hours after closing which means you end up working 14-15 hours. Not clear to me that publix is any better than CVS or Walgreens at this point. I remember only a few years ago, things were different. If you’re coming from a CVS or Walgreens and think Publix is the easy life, you may want to reconsider. You end up working in a way that potentially impacts patient safety because you are forced to work like a chicken with your head cut off. Often having lines of people with phone ringing, doctors calling in prescriptions, and angry people yelling at you because they have to wait 30 minutes just to pick-up their prescription because you are literally doing everything by yourself. This significantly increases the chance of you making a mistake and definitely impacts patient care because now half of your time your spending doing technician duties instead of focusing on patient safety. I’d would rather pay the technician out of my pocket or have it come out of my own pay than ti work under those type of conditions. Dont know the owner but from what I hear of him, I think he’d be disgusted with how things are being done. Anyway, some people get lucky and they get the better stores that actually have technicians 90% of the day. Maybe I will get lucky. If not, I’m out of here.

There is absolutely no regularity in the scheduled hours OR days. They change weekly. There is no way to have a family (unless they also work or shop at Publix) because weekends are LONGER workdays. Days off are when everyone else is at work or in school. I have no idea who thinks up these schedules (using that term very loosely , because schedule implies CONSISTENCY), but they or their algorithm need training in logistics. On days when there is a truck coming, have extra staff at work, not fewer. Assistant managers need to be prepared to throw stock on the shelves when the workers call out. Management knows exactly when everyone is scheduled to leave (BECAUSE THEY ARE HAVING FITS OVER TWO MINUTES OF OVERTIME), and without fail 15 minutes before time to leave they want the entire store blocked. On the subject of overtime, it's a non-starter. You may be scheduled for 5 - 8 hour days , but because of the speed at which your duties change, you will work 11-12 hours on the weekends, a couple of 9 hour days and on the fifth day go in for 8 minutes and be required to take an hour break. Because no matter how much actual necessary work there is, there is NO OVERTIME. All full time employees are ""supposed"" to have one weekend day off, if we do though the other one will be extra long. Weekends are for family, so when scheduled on Saturday or Sunday OR BOTH, the employees should be allowed to leave on time. My store has recently begun scheduling me for midnight shifts, AFTER a day shift of 4am - 1pm. I get off work about 2pm from those, have to go home eat something and go to bed by 3 in the afternoon to be able to get up at 11:00 and be at work by midnight until 9 the next morning. There is no Work/Life Balance in this company. I have no idea how employees with young families ever see their children.

Your average working hours will depend on the manager's criteria and it may be that on average you work only 10 hours per week and if you have to pay bills you will be lost because the manager may not care, they do have enough hours of work per week. Nor can you have a fixed work schedule a week that allows you to look for another stable job because the schedules change every Tuesday at night and it can happen that one week you work Sunday, Monday and Wednesday in the morning and the next week your work schedules be Sunday, Thursday and Friday afternoons. Although they will always give you the option to leave in writing your availability to work if you cannot work on weekends and cannot work after 8 pm no matter your reasons, you can be questioned by your manager and as blackmail will tell you that For that reason you cannot get more than 10 hours of work per week. I repeat, it does not matter that the reason is for health, or because you have a family situation where you should take care of another person. If you expect to get a full-time job in the company, forget it, it will be a minimum of 10 years before that happens, no matter if you are the best worker in the world, this will not happen easily. If you work as a baguer and it is a typical Florida rainy day, with lightning bolts included, your manager may be more interested in having cars available for purchase rather than your own personal safety and will send it with a rain coat to pick up cars for purchase in the store parking lot.

I worked with some super sweet people as well as a few sour apples (as is found anywhere). Life is what you make it and so is being a cashier at Publix.

Managers tend to talk to their associates in a condescending tone consistently. The occasional bad worker doesn't get reprimanded out of fear they'll quit and a replacement will have to be hired (this is a problem for Publix because they may potentially have to pay the replacement more). Front Service Clerks get shafted often in terms of pay, hours, and treatment. Associates are expected to both clock out on time and do their job thoroughly and efficiently. While this is not a problem on its own, sometimes things happen and someone may have to stay a little while longer to make sure the job gets done right. This results in being scolded, sometimes screamed at or written up for clocking out late, though if we clocked out on time with the job unfinished or not done effectively, the result would have been the same. Trying to enforce that standard at all times with no exceptions makes working at Publix feel like holding onto an extremely sharp double-edged sword. Getting full-time is extremely hard and time consuming, and half the time associates that have it and don't want it are afraid to revert back to part time because of how long they waited to get the position. Many even say it's not worth shooting for. The only advantage is being guaranteed 40 hours, but no more than that as Publix doesn't want to pay anybody overtime, and slightly increased pay ceiling and floor. Working hard only temporarily earns you benefits like sub cards.

The stores have a ration of full-time to part-time employees that they maintain, and someone has to leave, retire, or die before the store manager even thinks about moving up a part-time employee. So, you get virtually no benefits, outside of a free flu-shot once a year and some mediocre insurance plans. My husband's employer (that has less than 25 employees) has much better insurance. Orientation also tells you that Publix is an employee-owned company, and it is great to have stock. You have to work 1000-1500 hours in a single year (depending on what type of stock program you want to get into), which is super hard for part time employees. Their mission statement states among other things that they value the happiness and employability of their employees... but they don't. At least not more than any other company I have ever worked at. I am constantly scheduled for 5-8 hours without a scheduled break, and they don't care if I get one. Many corners are cut for time. And if you talk to a manager (they claim to have an open door policy where you can talk to anyone in the food chain), even if you ask for anonymity, it is NEVER anonymous. You are told to greet everyone who passes 10 feet from you within 10 seconds, which begins to feel like harassment during busy days. Should a customer complain about a mistake on a cake or order, customer service will never ask you for your side of things, they will give the customer the items at a discount or free and then dress you down, sometimes in front of the customer.If you volunteer to work outside of your requested hours just once you will then be expected to do it forever. You get no increase in pay for cross-training. If the department is shorthanded, you will be expected to work two jobs for the same pay, and if you are good at it, it will become permanent.

I was there for 10 days. I might have tried to stick it out, but finding out I was pregnant days after I accepted the offer made me decide it wasn't worth the BS. I accepted a position in the understaffed deli department. I knew it wasn't going to be easy. What I didn't know was that the majority of current employees were very rude and aggressive toward new people. They deliberately ignored questions, mislead you, tried to make you do all the hard work, and would be mean to you and berate you because you didn't know anything. Deli people have the hardest job but are only given 30 minute lunches and no real breaks like the 15 minute paid breaks other retailers offer. And the 30 minute meals weren't scheduled, they're on some type of honor system where the employees that come in earlier go first, but sometimes they decide to wait until super late so if you happen to come in after them you're taking a meal an hour for the store closes.. and getting grief about it. I was part time but all the part timers in my department got 37 hours with no benefits, myself included. I noticed I was scheduled an 11 hour shift with a 30 minute meal allotment and mentioned that was honestly more than I can handle and was told that's what people get who express an interest in full time. That doesn't make sense.. FT and 11 hour shifts and just working FT hours and shifts without any benefits at first to somehow earn the status by pushing yourself to exhaustion? No thanks, not for me.

The only other tech at my pharmacy had been waiting for 4+ years as a part-time tech, and then was finally promoted to full-time while I was there.

(This can be disconcerting at times - even during the orientation process, employees will go out of their way to help you, even if you get lost on the way to and from the training rooms.) The fact that every Publix employee is invested in your happiness, because the employees literally OWN part of the company via stock investments, means that you tend to see it as your own. This also helps keep customer service easy and it comes naturally, even to people who are introverted. The fact that the original founder started the store chain in response to the way his previous employer did not have the time to listen to his concerns means that the entire company was founded on the idea of respect and making the concerns of the average employee felt. Lots of chances for advancement, even the CEO of the company started out at the bottom of the ""food chain"". The people in the corporate office usually have held 10 or more jobs in the company on the way to the corporate office. The company also has incredible job security - they have never laid anyone off, even during the recession. They also have a freakishly low turnover rate, just 5%. And many Publix employees refer their friends and family to work here as well, because its one of those few employers that people really do want to work for. Its not a ""grocery store job"", it actually becomes a transcendent experience. The pay is very competitive and the option to buy into the company stock, as well as a nice credit union that is available to Publix employees, means that the company stands head and shoulders above other companies in employee satisfaction.","The entire process from the interview (which is super easy), through the drug test results (takes a week to come back), through pre-orientation, then the Welcome to the Publix orientation (a 6 hour long process - exhausting but thorough, and not overly demanding), and then a second orientation at your store (also a 6 hour long process) can stretch into a weeks-long process - not a good process for employees coming into the job that want to start earning fast.

1398,"""The place can be decent to work for""",2.0,If you’re a good employee you can get a decent raise every six months. Most people that work there are pretty nice and friendly. Including most of the customers that come by every so often. Management can be fair sometimes.,The hours are really bad. Unless you’re working during a holiday week then they tend to give more hours and or if they’re short handed. They say they’ll give you full time after a year but don’t actually offer it unless you’ve worked there longer or they need someone badly to work full time. But I was never even offered it after a year of working there. If you work there make sure you stick up for yourself because some employees tend to still walk over you and tell you what’s right and what’s wrong even though you did your training a long time ago. Also if you change your schedule make sure you stay on top of it because it took them 5 months to change my schedule. And make sure you make every customer happy because if something happens and it’s not your fault and they complain to management. The manager will most likely always take the customers side over the employees side. So be careful what you do at work. Some management can be fair. But not always. And you can’t really go above and beyond there unless it’s under Publix’s employee safety standards. I only know this because I went above and beyond and helped customers and then got told by management that if something bad happens it can fall under Publix. And if you’re looking to make employee friends at work. Make sure it’s while you’re with a customer or away from management. Otherwise you’ll get in trouble for talking to an employee because “productive work.” Also if you use a phone to check for your time. Make sure it’s away from customers and managers. Otherwise if someone complains management will threaten to take your phone away even if you don’t use it in bad ways that affect your actual work related stuff. Also I cleaned up blood once at my job because I was handed a bottle of cleaning spray by management which isn’t an employees job. But I used gloves thankfully. And you can do so much work there at times and it’s just a repeating process all the time. Sometimes you can be working way more then everyone else and it can be annoying when you’re doing more work then others when in reality it should be more of a team effort. Also early in the morning and or really late at night time there isn’t much to do at work so you basically just do nothing in between those times. Other then that it gets pretty busy at work. As for the pay. It’s decent and after time it could be better. But it could be better. Most of the stuff listed above this is the reason why I left my job and there’s a lot more I could say but it would be a book of stuff honestly.,Publix

I called out several times for the flu and my grandmother being very sick. No one told me it was on me to find a replacement, so I got several tardies without being told how the system works. I got suspended because they changed the schedule on me, so that also was put down as a “no call, no show.” I checked the schedule periodically because I was afraid of losing my job.

Advancement opportunities, again, are generally only available to people who are friends with someone higher up the chain.

Publix preaches they are employee owned and not publicly owned. There's a problem with this. The older employees and management don't care so much about new employees but more so their stock. 2. Over 56% of Publix employees are part-time aka no benefits. 3.a You have to work their 1000 hours over a year before you start to earn stock which is terrible for new employees. 3b. Additionally, in order to sell any stock you earn you have to work for Publix three years at 1000 hours a year and only then can you sell it. 4a. They start you at part time. However, this can still be just under 40 hours a week. I don't know about you but most people I know consider part time like 15-25 hours. 4b.If you want full time status you have to apply (after a year with 40 hour avg work weeks) and be accepted by store manager or you will stay at part time status, aka no benefits. 5. You work whatever hours they need you. There is no set schedule. 6.

But then I did not show up the day after Irma which erased the 6 days straight (50hour week) I pulled right before. Its just never enough for the narcissists that manage the place. And HR doesn't exist in this company. I called everyday like 5 times for 2 weeks straight and left messages to report the hostility I received after upsetting the store manager. Its sad, I was so passionate to be apart of such a successful company, but if they don't do something about their middle managers the company will not last.

It is not as difficult to move up or get full-time as everyone on here makes it out to be however......you will work your butt off to get it. You have to outperform your co-workers on the regular to be considered. The job itself, no matter what you do, is not rocket science but it can be physically hard work. The ONLY positions in the store where you will have the same days off every week are Price Clerk or DSD/Back door receiving, other than that your schedule will always change. These are positions that you have to move into after being hired. They are both very detail oriented, deadline driven positions and are not for everyone. The company offers a 401k and a percentage match to what you put in. It has it's own credit union which I have used for a number of years and prefer it to most banks. The company, as of my last term of employment, gives quarterly bonuses based on store performance. They used to be much better but have decreased considerably. The stores rarely work stock crew or any crew for that matter overnights. This is usually done to build holiday displays or for some other event that requires the store be free of customers.","-Some customers can be incredibly rude and demanding. -If you apply for Grocery Clerk be prepared to bust your butt, especially if you live in Florida which is a seasonal state. The stores double business in season and get incredibly busy. My store, a smaller one, got 15 to 17 pallets of freight several times a week. That has to be worked before you go home and if someone calls in sick....well, you get the picture. -If you choose to work dairy.......be prepared to really work your butt off. Dairy gets wiped on the regular and requires a lot of stamina to keep up with in season. - Department managers can be wonderful or really make you life miserable. They key to dealing with that is just do your job, do what they ask, when they ask. You don't have much choice. Management rotates stores every so often -mandatory by the company- so at some point you will get a new manager anyway. - The down side to management sift is that when you get used to the ways of one a new one comes in and changes things. -Raises are only about .25.
