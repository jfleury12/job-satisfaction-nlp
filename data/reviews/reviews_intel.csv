People who very obviously need to get fired tend to be there a very long time before they are sent off, even when their problems are gratuitous.

However, in larger organizations at Intel, management tends to try and fill positions as quickly as possible (or risk losing headcount).

It's hard to get bored here but easy to move around if you do. There are always new challenges to be addressed, some new and some that have been around for years. If you want to excel the opportunities are endless for a self-starter. 2) Work/life balance has been pretty great for the most part. I've done my share of late nights and weekends, but I've also always had the flexibility to take a last minute day off. Or to leave for a couple hours in the day for an appointment without having to get approval to do so. It's a give/take situation. If you need to be out you're trusted to find coverage and to do what is needed to get your work done. I don't feel like my movements are dictated, and that is super important to me.","1) Like I said, there are always problems to be fixed - locally and those that are globally impactful. I don't think management does a good enough job identifying those people who have given up on trying to solve the big problems - essentially the dead weight of the company. I have come across so many people who have told me they can't be bothered to fight for certain improvements, or that they have given up trying. These people have gone into 'coast' mode. We're supposed to be the best of the best, but management doesn't always manage their people the right way to ensure that is the case. 2) My relationship with my direct managers has always been a trustworthy and respectful one. But if you go one or two levels up that trust degrades considerably. There is a lot of 'management speak' that doesn't feel genuine, and decisions are made without transparency which causes distress amongst employees. Rumors are not quickly dispelled, and overall it feels upper management just does not have the right connection or 'finger on the pulse' when it comes to their employees/individual contributors. 3) As an employee I sometimes feel like I don't know where Intel is going as a company. We get our hands into so many things - new areas and saturated markets. It's hard to keep track of what is most important at any given time.",Intel

977,"""Leader in semiconductor for decades""",4.0,"Intel is one of the most technologically advanced companies. There are many rumors about Intel's work culture and brutality. But one I need clarify, if you want to be a leader and stay there for decades you need to be brutal. Work life balance: It varies from group to group. If you are in the CMOS manufacturing (which is main area Intel is the leader) then work life balance is bad. If you are more away from the wafer, things are far better. Compensation: I have interviewed with several companies in bay area and wanted to give an idea about this. Remember this is not software company, so comparison with Google, FB, will not be meaningful. Base Salary: Average, or below average compared to other hardware companies. Annual increase in fab locations (Oregon, Arizona) is low. But in Santa Clara is higher. However they compensate this low salary by other things (see below) Bonus: In last few years overall bonus varied from ~14%-19%. If you notice, the minimum bonus is ~14% which quite high for many other companies. So, if you get an offer in other companies keep in mind that Intel regularly pays good bonus (compared to HW companies). Profit sharing Bonus: Quarterly, Performance Bonus: Annually. Stock Refresh: This will be variable, for a 6 yr experienced Intel employee, I was getting ~$20k annually (this is stock level 2, where stock level 1 is the best). vest in 4 years with one-fourth yearly 401k: IMPORTANT: even if you DO NOT contribute anything, Intel deposits ~5% of your annual salary in 401k. Means, if your annual salary is $100k, you will get $5000 in your 401k even if you dont contribute anything. Catch is: it does vest immediately, you need to stay for 6 years to get all vested, if you stay for 4 yrs or less only 40% will be vested.",Cant think of anything specific.

I felt we were more as a team as we were able to interact with other teams better working on the same project. Starting pay, RSUs and raises were once good like 5%, but ever since moving grade levels, noticed the raises were not as good. I got higher pay increases when I started off at a lower level than higher unless promoted.","I am ranking these as I see fit. 1. Under BK as our CEO things have gone really bad like our benefits. We are making record revenues and profits every year, but somehow our money is not going back to the employees. Our raises keep on getting worst every year and for RSUs, it keeps on getting worst value wise. I remember getting promoted from grade 5 to 6, 5 years ago and I got SSL2 stock worth $11K value. When I got from grade 6 to grade 7 promotion my manager was only able to give me SSL3 stock worth only 7.5K. Then, our 401K for retirement has not been reinstated back to 6%. Our quarterlies funding drops as well, as we do not have anymore winter parties and are replaced with snag a snack day. Management always talks about cost cutting, but they seem to make some big acquisitions and spend a lot of money on external executive hires and a lot of diversity propaganda. Unfortunately, there are a lot of senior leaders that left the company that would have made a fine CEO in the future. 2. Go through many managers, (1 manager per 1 year) 3. Working with other cross sites in way different time zones. Europe and Asia, always trying to find the right time to fit into our schedules. Sometimes we need to have meetings either late or early. 4. Lots of reorgs, we go through once a year now. I do not see the point why other than it creates a new position for someone wanting to be promoted 5. Working on projects, we tend to work within our own team instead all different teams working together to solve problems. 6. Lots of meetings that are sometimes pointless, find out which ones are important to attend. I tend to skip some because they are not relevant to me. 7. Lots of Intel senior management that stayed within Intel for many years have left or ""retired"" during BK tenure and most of the upper staff tend to be folks we paid a great deal of money to hire on the outside.

You can easily move within the company into different products or disciplines. There is a fairly professional culture vibe (depends on team) that promotes a safe working environment (which is great) but is also very bland (cubes, grey walls, very poor celebrations).","Focal (the review process) creates a horrible culture by deliberately suppressing employees careers and wages. It creates a artificially limited resource (promotion budget) that encourages people to game the system by doing only what gets them promoted and not what helps their teams, their product, or the company. Promotions and raises are typically not a problem for more junior developers, but there is an extreme plateau for senior developers where advancement is not truly a meritocracy but more luck and opportunity based. I should also note that while the pay is decent for a tech company, it is extremely lacking for a top-tier tech company. Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Nvidia and others pay significantly more; and the CEO practically brags about about getting a good deal by short changing the employees (they deliberately aim to be average pay, and have no intent of being above average). There is also an extreme divide between engineering and non-engineering disciplines with different standards, expectations, and perceived value. Cross discipline skillsets are absolutely not rewarded or recognized despite being desperately needed. This exacerbates the big company problems of management hierarchy, political games, and poor decision making. Lastly, the current CEO Brian Krzanich is devastatingly bad for the employees of the company. Between his awful oversight of the layoffs in 2016, blaming first level managers for his own poor decisions and intentionally deceiving the employees in every single corporate meeting (like praising himself for giving back to employees due to the recent major tax savings, while hiding the fact he simultaneously removed bonuses that were worth more than the tax bonus), Intel has been hemorrhaging brain power. Unfortunately his actions have short term stock benefits despite the long term decimation of company culture and morale; it is unlikely he will be removed from his position by the board. I've been at the company 10 years, and it has been going strictly downhill for the last ~5-6. I've lost all my trust and allegiance to the company, and the only thing that keeps me there is the personal connection to my team.

Some of the best talent in the company sees it as a stepping stone to get to better tech companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. Constant reorganizations in all departments takes away any feeling of job security. This in-turn makes it difficult to focus and work in a productive manner. The yearly review process pit employees against each other instead of accomplishments per the job description. Intel is one of the few companies out there that still uses a forced distribution model for yearly reviews, so there is always someone that will get a bad review even if they performed to their job expectations.

The only way to get to a raise is to be a people pleaser and work 80 hours or leave) There are some really knowledgeable programmers who know all the tricks to squeeze every ounce of performance out of a CPU.","Data science / machine learning specific comments: Intel has little vision for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It does not align with market expectations. It also does not want to solve current pain points of big data which sorely needs easy parallelization solutions and easy engineering tools. Most of the managers and executives are old: they don’t want to innovate either from a hardware nor a software standpoint, but to reuse old business models that “worked”. They keep using deep learning benchmarks for computer vision that show their inferior performance to GPUs when there are NLP benchmarks that CPUs are better at than GPUs. And they just don’t even bother to hire people who know how to write machine learning benchmarks that showcase their products in a better light. They have trouble attracting good machine learning talents and the imposters scare the real talents away. I see “data scientists” and “machine learning researchers” at Intel who are actually programmers who took a few Coursera courses with a random (CS) degree. They think by running a few online tutorials, they KNOW machine learning and data science. Software at Intel is considered as non essential as hardware is the bread and butter. It speaks a lot for the (lower perceived) status of the software developers or data scientists at Intel. More importantly, if you are a software developer, expect that boosting hardware benchmarks to be your sole mission. Culture wise: The Data Center Group, despite being the growth engine, is beaten up by NVIDIA and has low moral. There are constant reorganizations, hiring freezes and firing rounds because the executives need to act like they are doing things. It cannot attract talent as it pays peanuts compared to top tier tech companies and act arrogantly like it is a top tier software tech company. I saw teams and teams of developers of promising software products (eg Apache spark and Hadoop) got gutted just when they start to get results. Also a lot of the devs do not know nor use modern software engineering practices like version control nor software testing for work. If you use something more up to date you will get marginalized. (Forget about teamwork). There is also little to no accountability for projects. They don’t care if a job is done well they only want you to say you have worked on certain shiny technology. HR experience: They have terrible hiring procedure and HR people have terrible attitude. The HR pits teams against one another to fight for talent and they complain to each other afterwards. The HR person also had the worst attitude for salary negotiation as if s/he does not expect a negotiation. The clerical staff was overworked by all the managers for supplies and paperwork and was discontinued because s/he was on a contract and it expired.",Intel

Even when they hired certain VP's by paying 25M+ for them to come in and whip engineerings butt in shape, still nothing has changed. The VP's talk the talk and say how we are revamping our core of engineering, but in the end, they bend over for the shareholders and will ride this money wave out until they're obligation is up and then bounce out. At engineering updates they are giving us EPS (Earnings per share) numbers and how project bla is going to make us money. The pay is pretty mediocre. RSU's are grim. you won't break 10k over 4 for a quite a few years. Stock purchase is okay, capped at 5% base income.
