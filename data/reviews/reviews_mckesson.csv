Its own competition is itself. Just look at the resumes of those working there. Everyone who has a 'senior' title just simply jumped around every 12-18 months... never becoming an expert in their function. This has lead to many of the wrong people in the wrong seat.

209,"""Great Opportunities--you get out what you put in""",4.0,"Overall, McKesson is a great company to work for if you're willing to work hard (and roll with the punches/be adapatable). As such a large company, there are virtually endless opportunities to expand your skillset (through both new roles and free training), but you have to put forth the effort to find/complete them. Their benefits, PTO, work from home, and work/life balance are generally great. There are lots of good people at the company, and lots of opportunities to network, collaborate, and try different kinds of roles. McKesson generally rewards employees who work hard, which is why so many people stay with the company for long periods of time/the life of their career. With any large company there will always be politics, but generally speaking, people who work hard (and network) do not have trouble getting promotions.","There is definitely a divide between those who hustle and those who 'coast'. The people who take advantage of learning/development opportunities are generally the hard workers/people who will move up at the company--however, there are still a large number of people (usually who have been with the company for 15+ years) who are content to do the bare minimum to keep their jobs. Those people exist both at the lower levels as well as in management--not all managers are willing to help their employees develop if it requires more effort than just a monthly check in. If you're under a bad manager, you can feel undervalued/overworked, while other people on the team seemingly do nothing all day and are compensated better because they have been with the company for a long time. In these situations, the only way out is to change roles/teams (which thankfully, McKesson has lots of opportunity to do). This leads to a 'brain drain' effect in the same departments over and over again, where long-time employees who consistently do not meet metrics stay with the department for years, while the 'new recruits' come in, work extremely hard, become disenchanted because they are overworked/underpaid, and leave the team as soon as they hit the 1 year mark and have the ability to apply out within the company. As the pharmaceutical industry grows and changes, McKesson has felt the pinch to cut costs as much as anyone. In some instances, that has led to senior management making sweeping changes to cut costs (while they adamantly deny it is cost-related) without thinking through the feasibility/impact on employees' day to day ability to do their work (for example, moving to flexible/non-assigned workspaces for the entire campus, regardless of whether or not some teams never work from home and need a desk every day to do their jobs).",McKesson

They are constantly talking about doing more with less (i.e. if someone in your department leaves or quits, they will not be replaced, their work will be redistributed to you and when you say it can't possibly be done, it is literally impossible they will act like you are being lazy and treat you even more like garbage.) They're constantly saying they want people to make suggestions to improve processes, etc., but when you do, they just say it can't be done or dismiss it. Your input is not actually wanted. Then they constantly wonder why morale is low and why they score so poorly on the employee opinion survey every year.

Those folks, and even some of the McKesson folks, are competent and nice people. Should you end up there, you will figure out who is who in fairly short order.","Here is why to avoid this software development organization : * The two guys at the head of the organization are inconsiderate, often not in the building, and do not care about your opinion about how best to proceed. This is the case regardless of the technical depth and experience in your background. These two will make decisions that impact a large percentage of the organization without consulting anyone else. * One of these two guys barely can make it into the office by 2pm some days, if at all. Then, will have the nerve when calling into a meeting with a large number of attendees, ask them all to get closer to the phone so he can hear what is being said. Yes, that kind of inconsiderate. How about getting in the building in the morning and attending the meeting in person like the other 15 people are doing? * The other kind of lack of consideration? Agreeing that you will present some slides at an all hands of your organization to show the staff you are behind the process, then when the time comes, not showing up, not saying anything to anyone at all about process concensus, not apologizing to the organizers, not apologizing to the people that had to end up presenting their slides in their absence. Just unbelievable. * The technology choices made there are poor and end up prohibiting your productivity and thus it takes you much longer to get anything accomplished. That is just going to get worse, and the inconsiderate two guys will be the last to raise their hand and say ""We made poor technology choices and have to migrate away from them"". * Why these two guys haven't been fired is just tragic for all those under them. I guess the reason they are in fact still in place is because they cannot find anyone else that will hire them. How are you going to identify these two individuals? Ask around about them. Ask who made a certain decision and why. You will narrow them down pretty quickly.",McKesson

Every time you call the help desk you typically have to be transferred 3 or 4 times before you get to the right individual that can assist you with your problem. Low pay: You are typically paid well below market value as compared to the company's competitors. Hard to move around: It is surprisingly hard to switch teams. You will notice that individuals in management will move teams a lot, but it is very difficult for lower level or entry level employees to do the same. You really have to get several people to put in a good word for you to move around or get promoted. The company is very ""politics heavy"". It is very much about who you know and who likes you. It can be hard to receive recognition if you are on a team that does not receive a lot of visibility to upper management.",McKesson
