Employees are technically assessed on many aspects of performance, but the only one my manager focused on was lines of code. - Competitive culture: Constantly talking about PSCs meant everyone on the team was afraid of any appearance that they did something wrong, which created a culture of blaming others and never admitting mistakes. Managers either stayed out of it or made it worse. - Workload: My tech lead set deadlines that were too aggressive and didn’t listen when my teammates and I pushed back, so we were constantly behind schedule. Working late at night and on the weekends consistently was required just to remain a few months behind schedule. - Asking for Help: Several members of my team had to ask for help writing code many times per day. Most of their questions could be quickly solved by typing a few words into a search bar and looking at the first result, but they still asked another engineer any time they encountered something they didn’t already know how to do.

That is no different than any other company but it can be night and day here. Generally here are the Pros - People: Majority of the other Facebookers are of high quality and surrounding yourself with other smart people can only up your own game. - Benefits: Positive package here overall. They take care of your health, make some life task much easier and try to make life more comfortable. - Technology: Innovative mindset is a big plus but recent years have been more mirror moves with competition to gain an advantage. Good move but for those that want to break the glass into new frontiers, you got to pick the right team. Impact: The opportunity is there for you to embrace.",Generally here are the Cons: - People / Culture: There is a small minority of leftist that can be loud and push activist agenda's that are in your face. While my own goals can align (leftist) I don't like their approach. This is just society creeping into the corporate world and is seen across Tech in general. It can be toxic and extremely disrespectful. You might find more of this at Facebook due to the nature of the product. Imagine the rest... Pick your team wisely. - Weak Leadership: Lot of new leaders... Experienced leaders may not have much experience with trouble shooting negative situations and come in with a bias. Another point here is the number of Re-Orgs. You might experience multiple changes within a quarter / half and this can drag on for years. - Negative news cycle ... it can be draining but it should be a wake up call to further innovate for a product for today.

You will also learn a lot.","The culture is pretty bad and the performance review system is a joke. Unless you abide 100% by their culture, you can't be happy. This means you are not allowed to even question their principles. If you think something needs to be fixed at the root cause, you are in trouble, because you need to Move Fast! The company over-focuses on the short term speed rather than long term. I was lied to multiple time by management. I was told my rating depended on the reviews from my peers, but then when the perf came, I realized it is 100% up to the manager regardless of what your peers say. My manager told me constantly I was doing great, then perf came and because I questioned the principles, I had a bad rating. The 360 was useless, management can use if they want to promote you, but if you are not in great terms with your manager, the 360 will be ignored.

33,"""Excellent Place to Work""",5.0,"The opportunity that Facebook offers for autonomy and career growth is incredible; coming in as a new grad PE I have the opportunity to grow based on merit and performance, not time in the role. Flexibility in when I work, how I prioritize my projects, and the scope of my work is invigorating and makes me excited to come to work each day. The company is mission-driven to a great extent, and I have been impressed with the way we have owned up to prior mistakes and fixed them head on. The Production Engineering role is well respected within the company, and the importance of reliability and scaling increases as our services reach more of the world. As a PE you will gain the knowledge necessary to build and operate real hyperscale systems capable of providing services to billions of people. My team is comprised of some of the smartest, experienced engineers I have ever met - some of which have been building Linux services since 0.01. Even though sometimes working at Facebook feels like drinking from the proverbial fire hose, I am grateful I have the opportunity to learn from some of the top people in their field. For example, in bootcamp I took a command-line efficiency class from Jim Meyering, one of the maintainers of coreutils and also a Facebook employee. Many other people have commented on this, but the perks and compensation are still top-notch. The company helps take care of your life so you can focus on work while you're working.","Facebook hires the kind of people that expect a lot from themselves. Despite some reports, you do not need to work long hours in order to succeed at Facebook. Bootcamp gives you the chance to find a team that matches you well, and new hires should come in intending to join a team where they can both find balance and grow in their career. The company is growing and there is some sentiment around slowing down, but most engineering teams are still bottom-up driven and innovating in their space. The things we are doing around privacy and AR/VR are on the bleeding edge and we are strong leaders in these areas. On the other hand, ironically, there is also sentiment around moving too fast as a company. Since we are people- and product-focused (as opposed to engineering-focused, like at Google), our primary goal is to impact the lives of people for good. Sometimes this means we opt for rapid prototyping over beautifully designed code. However, we are doing much better at recognizing better engineering work such as cleaning up code and improving monitoring, especially in the PE role.",Facebook

If you join a team with a good manager who knows the system, you will be more likely to have a productive, prosperous time at Facebook. If you join a team with a bad manager, your work-life balance will be horrible. You will feel extreme pressure with the Performance cycle review every six months. Worse yet, you may even blame yourself for what's happening, not realizing the role your manager plays until it is too late. Facebook is a good company for new college graduates. Even with a bad experience, you can learn so much about practical, applied technology here. For those with several years of experience, or with family commitments, be careful. Come into Facebook with a clear sense of what you need from Facebook that you cannot get anywhere else. Be prepared to leave when that is delayed, or not a possibility, or comes at a cost to your family or external commitments.

The meals provided are of good quality and are free as are the snacks that are provided.,"(I worked in the Austin, Tx office under the Community Operations organization) Rampant hostile political atmosphere Team leadership and IC's will undermine and berate service team members to push their agendas forward. This is often overlooked by leaderhip and results in burnout and lack of empathy from everyone. This in turn produces subpar results and half-baked solutions. No one wins. Sloppy processes It's a benefit of a doubt to even say there are processes. Most of the internal processes are poorly documented and no one has or wants to give time to onboard new hires (see comment below on the culture driving self-absorbed motives). Getting anything done is 60% figuring out the best way forward, 20% fighting off the political backlash from making said decision and not the one the loudest stakeholder in the room wanted, and 20% is actually spent doing the work. So much waste. No concept of agile or the fundamentals of development practices in parts of Community Operations. No humanity in the human facing part of the org Working in Community Operations often felt like working in a call center. People often don't care about their work and they don't care to look beyond the ""what's in it for me"" philosophy running the show to see the people that the organization is supposed to help. We're talking about posts around some of the worst stuff out there- and the lack of empathy around it is nauseating and explains alot of the trouble Facebook has been getting into. Custom everything means sloppy everything So many of the internal tools are custom- even the ones that don't need to be! Often the tools are under supported (or supported by a staff that isn't willing to take feedback) so you end up with subpar tools supporting a massive company that is in desperate need of some tools that are built with intent and full functionality behind them. Culture breeds self-absorbed motives within people Facebook's culture is oriented around ""impact""- what impact did YOU have this performance evaluation period. It's not enough to say that you helped remove content that was harmful to minors (as an example unrelated to my direct experience). The impact needs to tie back to numbers- how many lines of code, how much money was saved, how many productive hours were saved-- not one of the questions asked is about how it helps the PEOPLE that use Facebook. It is all inward focused on the individual contributor- and as such the individual contributors act accordingly. There is not team oriented thought or conduct in my experience across Community Ops. There is only ""What's in it for me?"" HRBP are often ill informed on processes and policies and rotate like the second hand on a clock You never know what you're going to get with the HRBP group- some are warm and empathetic others are very clearly only there to protect the company (meaning they'll pigeon hole you into a defensive position). I didn't have a great experience with them and even in my exit process they got details wrong- like really important details. Kind of disappointing. Middle management is hijacking the company for personal gain and Upper Management hasn't caught on yet When I hear Mark talk- I see someone who really does believe in the mission behind the company- to make the world a more connected place. But I'm not sure that he or his team see the snakes in the grass that are not aligned to that mission and only looking for ways to achieve their personal gain.

No stack ranking, but a curve is implemented a org level. This is not a big deal in other companies but here it means 'out'. Managers main job is to write performance reviews, and this often leads to micro management that can be extremely frustrating to senior engineers. There's lot of work duplication, most managers (even directors) ignore it as performance reviews is all about impact. Most engineers know that everyone wants to write code and make impact, so ignore the code duplication. Some teams are hiring just for the head count, not much impactful work. This becomes a problem for senior engineers as they have to invent work or get out. Before joining a team check out their roadmap for at least a year. This is a good place if you want make money at the cost of WLB. Not a place to be innovative, which inherently carries risk and takes time. It's a risk because if there's no impact you'll be fired.

One of policies is an openness - this includes famous weekly Q&amp;As. Senior management tries to explain the background behind decisions, so you know why one or another thing had to be done. In general everything focuses on making product which would be better for customers. There were a number of mistakes makes with privacy perspective, but there is a trend to improve this. This is very good approach - instead of hiding mistakes, company focuses on fixing them. After getting an offer I was not sure to join the company because of its reputation, but being inside I figured out most of this is an exaggerations to make a hype in news. Work style is very flexible - you want to deliver new things, to make an impact, but from another perspective, it is not demanding and it is far from sweat factory in some other companies. It left time to learn something, you can attend many meeting remotely. Work life balance is very good - it is difficult to improve it without affecting the work (someone should do the work, right?). There are a lot of young people around (ex-students, but usually with great knowledge), but also there are still a number of experienced people - so aging doesn't seems to be a problem at FB.","Work style is open space. Many new buildings are awesome, while a number of old buildings are depressing - dimmed lighting, gray ceilings. Some buildings have a quiet policy, but for others it is not so good. I'd recommend remodel old buildings (hack, paint ceiling to a white, so it will reflect the light, install better lighting, work with designers!), split large rooms into smaller, team-sized rooms, add more VC rooms so people could easier get on conference call without disturbing others. Another minus is hyper-concentrated campus in Menlo Park. It is difficult to find a good, reasonable-priced rent in that area.

You may be asked to do a lot of ad-hoc analyses from eng team, which I am sure are very important and can guide engineers whether to implement certain features, but that will prevent you from doing some deep dive analyses and learning some new techniques in data analysis. Maybe after a year or two, you will find that you did not build any statistical models or haven't touched any machine learning.

These are usually employees with less than a 2 year tenure. The rest of the 40% are classified as the FB veterans, who believe they deserve certain privileges (like mistreating and bullying new employees). The culture is to blame as FB values tenure over experience. An IC with 2 years of FB experience and 0 years of life experience is perceived to be more valuable than a FB noob with 15 years of industry experience. It's akin to that one possessive and insecure person in a group of friends who gets down right hostile when a new friend enters the circle. I'm the only noob on my team so you can imagine my plight. The team is very hostile towards me and I absolutely dread coming to work every day. My manager encourages and actively participates in this kind of high school-esque nonsense. I made a huge mistake coming to FB and I can't wait to leave. You have been warned-do not join unless you're a glutton for punishment.","See above-yes, you guessed right, there are no pros!

Speaking with a number of employees who left Facebook only to return once again, while no company is perfect, there is a lot that Facebook has to offer - not just in terms of benefits, but with the impact that our apps and services have on this world - for people and businesses alike. Our open culture is pretty amazing to understand the vision of our company and where we're heading. Leadership has been consistently transparent in ways that many other companies are not - even other tech companies - with weekly Q&amp;As, open posts, and quarterly all hands. And they address tough issues or topics head on. There are a lot of career opportunities within the company - as we often refer to the ""jungle gym"" that you can take your career internally. There are incredibly passionate people who work at Facebook, and I never cease to be amazed by the level of intelligence and care demonstrated by my coworkers around the world to help our company deliver on our mission.","Particularly as of late, Facebook has been subject to a lot of negative press. While some of it may be deserved, a lot of it feels sensationalist. So employees have to develop a thick skin and resilience to a lot of this scrutiny and ensure that we are focused on the long-term, not just the short-term. But perhaps the primary area of improvement is that people are driven and work hard - which sometimes comes at the expense of the work/life balance that we all try to achieve.",Facebook

If you're right out of college, this might be the place for you, but that's mostly because you wont have much work experience to compare it against.","1) the job I got is not the job I thought I was getting: As an engineer, with engineer in the title, and over 10 years of experience, I really thought I would get to do more engineering. Unfortunately, the job is really about 50% business analyst and 20% project management, and 30% engineering. You are expected to own every aspect of your project, regardless if anyone else actually does. Also, you're told you have the opportunity to choose the team you want to be on, but for me, that choice was removed at the last minute. 2) bad management, bad leadership - all managers are expected to be individual contributors which is basically another way of saying that they aren't particularly good at either, and do not have time to devote to both roles. Also, be prepared for mansplaining. 3) more money than sense: gobs and gobs of money are being thrown around. there's basically an offsite every other week. Nevermind about work, deadlines, or being competent, it's more important to go glassblowing. The pay is nice, in fact, its the best feature about the place. 4) the company that wants to connect the world would rather loose talent than have remote workers. no, seriously. say you're on a team, and your team decides to move to another office thats like 1 hour away. you are kicked off the team and put on another team. what sense does that make? new mom wants to wfh? not allowed. Seriously, it's called skype, people. 5) and speaking of teams, the team structure is completely whack. instead of having a core group of people I work with on many projects, I have a different group of people I work with on each project. a completely different set of swe, pm, ds, and de for each project. This completely limits our ability to grow more efficient with each project, let alone build any sort of a professional relationship. 6) you're not allowed to fix things that are legit broken. I've only been here a short time and have already had to suffer fools who prefer poorly designed metrics with political bs to actually measuring things properly. bug 1 told not to fix it - too big to fail, bug 2, never got fixed by other team, bug 3, too high profile to fix. seriously? why not just admit all your metrics are wrong? 7) people care more about performance reviews than actual performance. no really, if I hear the phrase make ""an impact"" I will vom. What this really means is not ""do good and useful work"" which is how it might be interpreted, instead it means that you should very little on the very high profile projects, and then post it everywhere, to make sure people NOTICE. Also, keep a log of your work so that you can share it with your absentee manager come review time - otherwise, he (yeah I said he) likely will have no idea what you worked on or why.

This helps you use and sharpen your skills in an entirely new way, and really think through your logic and decisions—unpacking every detail because you have to make sure it works and is understood across all demographics, countries, cultures, and languages. They also take care of employees. Everything is free: shuttle rides, laundry service, professional development courses, tons of swag, and all the food, snacks, and drinks you can eat (the “Facebook 15” is real). The company’s health benefits are unmatched and they even have medical, dental, and gym facilities on campus.","- politics and back channeling - competitiveness and lack of collaboration - relationships hold more value than quality work Facebook the company is like the platform: everyone acts like everything is great, but no one acknowledges or exposes what’s really going on under the surface. People act like it’s all sunshine and roses, but because there’s such a “focus on impact” and performance, it’s actually a competitive environment where people are out for themselves and scrambling for whatever projects will give them the most visibility—at Facebook, visibility &gt; impact &gt; high performance ratings &gt; bonus multipliers + equity refreshers. As a result, people you know and being an influencer matter more than the quality of your work. Likes are the real currency and even though you’re told to “be your authentic self”, one type of person benefits most: those who are extroverted, don’t rock the boat, and are oftentimes male. While the actual benefits and perks are great, don’t be fooled by the glamour of it all: they’re also designed to keep you there and keep you working. You’ll be taken care of, but the focus on impact and performance makes it’s easy to forget to take care of yourself. There’s an undercurrent of anxiety in the culture that is very real and not often acknowledged. Facebook is a great company for those just starting out their career. If you’re a seasoned professional, I suggest staying away. It doesn’t matter how much experience or expertise you have—I spent most of my time proving to people half my age that I knew what I was doing. Time and again, my suggestions would be ignored or edited to the point that they were no longer my ideas. Time and again, leadership would be shown those watered down ideas and say, “Nope!” Time and again, when I’d go back to my original recommendation, leadership would say, “That’s the one!” After awhile, it was finally time for me to say, “I’m tired of (and better than) this.”",Facebook

At its current rate, I don't think I can advise anyone to join now, and after I vest, I'm not sure I will stay. Part of this is that the starting comp isn't very good. The vesting stock is, but the cash is fairly mediocre (less than previous jobs I've had at far less profitable companies), and vesting accelerates over time. This nets to you being paid much more than before, year over year.

The company mission and values are incredibly admirable, but have become increasingly difficult to implement as the company has grown. * You might find yourself working on a project with over a million lines of code, but nobody on your team has written more than 10,000. The need to sit down and figure it out yourself can be pretty stressful in an environment that is pushing you to ""make an impact"" and be constantly shipping new features. * The few senior engineers (in my org at least) show little interest in mentoring more junior engineers. * Sink or swim mentality among engineers, the mega-teams supporting products in the core app can be brutal and unwelcoming. * Launch decisions are very political - criteria for launching a change is opaque, and feedback from department leads happens far too late in the development process (often in the meeting where a launch decision is being made!). Little has been done to fix these issues despite it being constant feedback for the past year. * Performance reviews put too much emphasis on immediate personal output rather than collaboration and assisting other teams. This causes teams and individuals to focus inwardly. While it's never been malicious, I've seen this behavior directly harm other team's productivity or metrics. * Work/life balance is below average on the day-to-day, but oncalls are truly awful. * Decision-making has become a bit too distributed between orgs and reflects in the overall product.",Facebook

Food is consistently great.","The only legitimate con I have about working here is meeting start times. Meetings go from 12:00-1:00 for example, with the following meeting starting at 1:00 promptly. This naturally leads to people starting meetings late. Also I get withdrawals on the weekends when at home because the food here is so good. It causes me to eat out more on the weekends and thus I don't actually save on my food bill.",Facebook
518,"""Perks Beyond Comprehension and an Opportunity to Change the World""",5.0,"If the reviews here sound like employees are really drinking the Kool-Aid...it's because many of them are. The people at this company genuinely believe they're changing the world by connecting it, and that mission and set of values permeate everything they do. -Unbelievable benefits and compensation. Seriously, some of their benefits are mind-blowing. Gym benefits, free (really good) food everywhere, amazing healthcare and family planning and daycare benefits (including a ""baby bonus""), access to incredible company events and speakers, generous vacation time that they're constantly encouraging you to actually use, the latest phones and computers for work use, on-site doctor and dentist that are actually good...the list goes on and on. - Strong company culture and values. I've never been at a company that lives and breathes a mission so completely. Am constantly in meetings where coworkers are asking, ""Is this the right decision for the people who use Facebook?"". Even the way they treat their contingent workers (who receive better benefits than most of the tech sector's contingent employees do) makes this evident; there are internal communication groups where full-time employees are constantly asking what more we could be doing for contingent workers to show our appreciation for their work. Both internally and externally, the ""#shiplove"" mantra is strong here. -Work/life balance. You'll see some mixed reviews on this point, but I've been here a year (non-engineering role) and I've never had the level of work/life balance I've had here. I work a very consistent 9-5, and it's rare when I have to fire up my laptop at home at night or over the weekends. -Facilities. It's Facebook! The campus is gorgeous, and they allow visitors. Hosting out-of-town friends and family for lunch or dinner is a great perk. -Efficient and fast. Fewer politics than many other companies of this size. A lot of the day-to-day communication and work gets done on the Facebook platform, which is hugely efficient and easy to use system. -The future! These guys have their hands in a lot of cookie jars, and are working on some really amazing stuff. Whether you're working on things like bringing internet access to the third world, virtual reality products, artificial intelligence that will serve peoples' needs, or all of the innovative things that go on inside the regular ol' Facebook app that serves over a billion people a day, chances are you're working on something really cool. -Women's leadership. I've also never been at a company that really understands women's needs as much as Facebook does (I think we owe this to the leadership of Sheryl Sandberg, Lori Goler and Maxine Williams). They encourage an ongoing dialogue about women's issues in the workplace, have mothers' rooms all around campus, encourage us all to take a ""Managing Bias"" course (which is really eye-opening, on many levels) and even host a yearly Women's Leadership Day, which is truly empowering. They bring in amazing speakers for this event and out of everything I've experienced in my first year here, this was probably the event that stayed with me the most.","-Entitlement. After you've worked here for a while, it's easy to get entitled. I'd say 95% of employees keep their feet on the ground and appreciative and gracious about the benefits they receive, but the entitlement plus the company's culture of open feedback (""feedback is a gift"") occasionally breeds inane complaints in internal communication groups. -That commute. If you live in SF, you'll have to hike down to Menlo Park, and depending upon where you're coming from and how bad traffic is that day, it could be as bad as 2 hours each day. The good news: that's rare, and company-provided transportation options (shuttles with WiFi) make this as easy as possible. You do get used to it, and your time on the shuttle is your own. Sure, you can do work, but you can also nap, watch Netflix, or read.",Facebook

People genuinely care about each other,"-you have to open your personal FB page up to co-workers (hard!)- makes sense that you use the product your company makes, but it's such a co-mingling of personal and professional lives. - there seems to be a group of the before and afters- who struggle to understand the company has grown and will not go back to the first 100 employees! This leads to a sense of entitlement and not playing as a team. - commute. UGH -Need to do better with giving back (as a company and as employees). I know our CEO has donated gazillions- but we need programs that allow employees to donate and have funds matched, and allow employees to volunteer their time. -More focus now that it's a larger company with 10K employees, on career growth and development.

520,"""Not for everyone, hypocracy and blame I saw mostly""",2.0,"Lovely campus, okay perks for contract workers.","The HR/training teams that I worked with were staffed by people that thougt they were experts. They indicated that no contractors could ever offer value; contractors were viewed as an extra pair of hands. However, my role was specifically to provide expertise and coaching in my domain area. The junior/mid-level staff never solicited feedback and assumed only their ideas were useful. Just because people say they are open to feedback does not make it so. I got unsolicited feedback constantly at FB: everyone has an opinion and thinks it's valuable. But, not once did anyone ever ask for my feedback. In that sense, and many others, it's a hypocritical environment. If you're junior or less than 15 years in your job, FB is probably a good place to grow. If you're more experienced, be sure you carefully evaluate the job. My experience is that I wasn't working with the best or brightest, more often they were the narrow-minded, arrogant and entitled. Finally, in the area I worked, it was all about blame and pointing fingers when things went wrong. And because they hate processes, of course things would go wrong.",Facebook

Anyone can suggest a new feature or improvement and be part of the team that makes it happen. There is a lot of opportunity for high performers to grow their careers.

Most companies have a mission; some say they follow it, and extremely few are actually mission led. Facebook truly believes in making the world more open and connected; including those people who aren't even online yet. Every role and department ladders back to that. In advertising sales, we have the goal of building our client's businesses by connecting them to the consumers who matter to them. More importantly, we ensure that people on Facebook are seeing ads that are relevant and high quality, this delivers shared value both for the advertiser and the end person using our products. We also have proven and measurable results across verticals, which drives continued client interest and adoption. Having come from another founder led company, Mark is incredibly brilliant, open, honest and hard working. He surrounds himself with fantastic people, listens carefully, cares about the people who work for him, and makes long view decisions for the health of the company. Management and the people who work at Facebook follow leadership's example, everyone rolls up their sleeves to get the work done, and is incredibly grateful to be here. As a woman it's also inspiring and impactful to have female leadership at all levels, and colleagues who are incredibly encouraging. I personally experienced this when a male peer encouraged me to apply for a management position on our team. He referenced the known bias that women are less likely to apply if they don't have 100% of qualifications vs. men who take it as a suggestion. Beyond gender, the entire company strives for diversity and acceptance.","You have to be very self driven to succeed. Seeking out and maintaining internal relationships is critical for success.

Couple that with the general immaturity of the company and you'll see some very poor judgement and ""Game of Thrones"" style politics in a few departments. Average tenure of a staff engineer is about 4 years - mostly because after the initial stock grants vest there is near zero incentive for anyone under a Director level to stay any longer. Culture creates and fosters entitled whiners - so much so that it is a running joke inside the company, with groups such as ""Patently Absurd Requests for Facebook Offices"" making fun of it all. But then again, this company is largely made up of the ""participation trophy"" generation, who have been told they were super-special since they were born. Being hired by Facebook amplifies that self-esteem level well beyond eleven. It is never spoken about, but staff turnover is huge. The washout rate of n00bs is likely around 40%.

As mentioned in the pros above, this means you're always working on impactful projects, but it also means your team is understaffed and you may have to work some nights and weekends to get stuff done (though definitely not as bad as the previous strartup I worked for). The more teams you work with, the worse this can get, since some people love to load up on meetings during the day. Egos: There are some people who are really full of themselves and difficult to work with. This happens anywhere I've been, but there's a special brand of self-importance among some folks here.

Interesting story to tell your friends.,"If you're a manager, this place will drive you nuts. Employees are snarky, entitled, and disrespectful brats. They have no concept of critical thinking or any desire to do real work. Unlimited sick days in the hands of overpaid children is impossible to manage, my team would somehow always manage to catch a ""cold"" on Fridays and Mondays. (Interesting that they would Tweet and post about their weekend party binges though.) While Facebook does a great job recruiting Ivy League talent, I was underwhelmed by the level of intelligence of ""Facebookers."" They are so busy congratulating themselves on being ""awesome"" that they never stop to consider they didn't have any real world work experience to back that assertion up. It's really hard to manage and lead people who ""know it all."" Kitchy inspirational posters everywhere you look. ""Be Bold!"" ""Dare Greatly!"" Yet, I didn't see any substantive work or product coming out of anyone, which makes sense since Facebook really is just a glorified website - users are the product. Communication is an absolute nightmare. You are forced to ""friend"" everyone you work with and join an incessant amount of internal group pages where you had to filter through all the BS people would post (memes, YouTube videos, snarky hipster comments…clearly these people didn't have enough work to do) to get to any relevant work related information you needed to know for your job. I actually thought I was going to get dumber working there. Meetings - the sheer volume was mind bending. None of them critical to doing actual work, more self congratulating on unearned awesomeness. Being social at Facebook was far more important than doing anything meaningful while you were there. Anyone serious about doing meaningful work need not apply. You'll make it a few months and then quit out of frustration.",Facebook
655,"""Facebook provides the means to invent the future""",5.0,"My compensation is extraordinarily high. The pipeline from research to deployment for a billion users is incredibly fast.

I must say I have been pleasantly surprised to see how everyone employed here has been living the company values. There is a lot of focus on moving fast, making mistakes and correcting upon your mistakes. People and processes are very open that makes decision making super fast. There is little to no room for people who want to do things in the dark. You can feel the proximity to Zuck's decisions.","If you are looking for cubical or office type privacy this place is not for you. If you like to keep your personal and professional life, that doesn't happen much here. Expectation is that if you are here, you are here to do things in your life that you love and there is no keeping that separate from your personal life.",Facebook

Sometimes seems like the unique evaluation system based on ""impact"" is too subjective.",Facebook
658,"""Facebook set me up for success""",5.0,"Facebook is a top tech company like Google, LinkedIn, Apple and many others. All of these companies offer basically the same thing: great engineers, good money, free food, impacting zillions of people and interesting tech problems. Facebook has a few things that set it apart: 1. Open-ness. Root on every box, access to every source repo. I very rarely had to wait to receive credentials to do anything. At other jobs you're often blocked sitting at your desk for a few days waiting for access to some repository. 2. Control over your career. You don't get hired into a specific team -- you choose it (in recent years they've added a list of teams you can choose from, but there's still a lot of variety). And if you get bored or feel stalled, you're encouraged to switch teams. I don't think other companies offer those things. The real list of pros is huge, but since they could be applied to other companies I don't include them here. The only reason I left is because I always wanted to start my own startup. Otherwise I would have stayed forever.","With everyone switching teams all the time there is often a lot of lost tribal knowledge. So there's parts of the codebase that no one understands anymore. Since the Great Shift to Mobile there's been a focus on quality at the expense of moving fast. I really liked the Move Fast and Break Things mentality of Facebook when I joined, and though people disagree with me, I prefer it to the ""don't ship it until it's perfect"" mentality (I think many of the independent Facebook apps waited too long to launch). Another thing that no one will agree with me on is the work-life balance. I have noticed a trend of people working less, hackathons running during the day, etc. I think your average employee is less driven and moves slower than a few years ago. This used to be a place where people were obsessed with shipping above all else. It isn't that anymore. This is a pro for some people but not for me. I'm giving it a 5 because I think it's good for your life, not because I agree with that balance.",Facebook

FB has its eye on the ball at all times for its core platform yet is always looking at other opportunities for growth, though they may take several years to bear fruit. Management is open and accessible, particularly the weekly Q&A's with MZ and the leadership team - I've never experienced senior executives sharing that much information with an entire company before. Colleagues are easy to work with - not a lot of ego or politics that I've seen. In fact, we are reminded to check our ego as we enter the building - there is a lot of cooperation here. The benefits & perks are really amazing - I don't think college hires or interns truly appreciate what is offered here unless they have worked for other employers. (You can never take these things for granted, so I really appreciate these perks.) And the total compensation structure seems very competitive - they have many dials and buttons to play with, and I feel I am well-compensated for my contributions. The commute benefits are excellent, and make it really easy to use transit, shuttles or vanpools. Driving to work is just so stressful, both ways. I'd really rather not.","Long hours away from home, due to my own commute situation and long working hours. But since I've only been here less than a year, it's important to show results early.

Social skills and personality can't be measured. As a result there is no one here you would ever be friends. The internal surveys bear this point that people don't have friends at work. Similarly for managers, they are selected strictly for their technical ability. Again, they have zero compassion. In my time being here, I've never once felt like anyone cared if I was here or not. Not once has anything positive ever been said. It's really astounding. Recruiting does an amazing job at making candidates feel wanted. That feeling disappears the moment you sign. After that, you have no manager or anyone who will care. You'll go into bootcamp where you'll have a ""mentor"". His role is to continue to do his job while counting the number of lines in your diffs to make sure you can make progress with no assistance. After bootcamp, you'll have a manager who operates in the same mode. They are interested in the technology and not the people. To them, you are a resource to be maximized. They will tell you everything you need to do to improve, but never once say ""good job"". In boot camp, I kept meeting these amazing, visionary dynamic managers. I know realize they were the exception. Those people made me love Facebook during bootcamp, but that feeling wore off quickly once I interacted with the average line level manager.

With that comes some of the big company downsides. Being smart politically can advance your career. If you keep your head down and just do a good job it's less likely to be noticed. For example, I see good engineers not going anywhere with their career even though they do good work, while I see average ones advance up the ranks if they make it a point to post in FYI for every feature they create. You also have less of a chance to make an impact as a new hire since you're more likely to work on existing features rather than new ones. If you joined about a year ago, your stock grant was over valued (by about 2x), so you're making a lot less than if you go to another company. None of the cons are unexpected at a large company. If you're looking to work for a larger, post IPO company, then you're not going to do better anywhere else.",Facebook

As an engineer I felt like I had a lot of control and influence over my work and the products I worked on and got to create some of the most impactful and satisfying products and features of my career, past and probably future. If you're really great at what you do or have really great product ideas, very little will interfere with you showing that quickly. New engineers are highly valued in the culture. Salary/bonus compensation has been really strong in addition to the stock compensation.","I've felt like I've been able to maintain a pretty good work life/balance (especially after the first year), but I feel like I had to work hard to make that happen. Being around many people who feel compelled to put most of their waking weekday hours into coding can be intimidating, even when you feel confident in the job you're doing and even when pressure to put in a ton of hours is rarely explicit. Engineers can definitely work reasonable hours, especially older ones with families, but you have to bring your own self-confidence to trust that you're kicking butt even if you're not putting in a ton of hours (especially during the summers when interns ratchet up the intensity around the office) Things are done very fast, which also means things can be hectic and sometimes chaotic (though this feels less and less true as the years go by), but I'd expect some culture shock for anyone coming from software companies where stability and consensus are top-priorities.

The engineering culture is aligned to enabling you to try things out, get things done and get them shipped out at an amazing rate. The perks are amazing and the management structure feels flat and low friction. Lots of smart folks and plenty of opportunities to get stuck into different areas if you feel like a change. Work/life balance is good; lots of encouragement to take a break when you need it with a pretty high frequency of offsite events, and flexible working hours. The onboarding process is very well put together: culture infusion from the moment you walk in the door, and you're mentored through a six week bootcamp and can be pushing code out to the website in your first week.","The flip side of the low friction management structure is that you need to take on more ownership of finding high impact work--don't expect to handed out work, you need to identify the work and then get it done. I see this as a plus, but it can make it a little difficult when you start out. Having a high density of smart folks can make it feel more competitive than it really is, and that combined with the pretty low average age of employees can result in the occasional abrasive conversation.

I have friends who love their job and role on the team they are in. This wasn't the case for me. Your company is as good as your manager and I had no good ones.,"1. Work/Life Balance If you don't make this boundary clear yourself and actively work on creating it - it will be exploited. Communication is broken in the company so you'll get messenger pings, quip notifications, emails, google doc updates at all hours. They even do long term project planning over chat groups in some teams. 2. Loads of unnecessary stress/anxiety related issues suffered by employees due to: (i) Managers fawning over each other showing ""impact"" of their teams - god help you if you don't make them look good or disagree with them. Anonymous reviews come through some of the time and people can say what they want about you. (ii) Unnecessary fighting between individual contributors due to performance review system. People ""strong arm"" you into doing work when it makes no business sense so it can make them look good. (iii) Bad reviews stick with you and you'll be treated differently - people are managed out/disappear/don't pass probation all the time. Speaking with friends in other companies FB isn't that attractive anymore and it's reputation is changing in the jobs marketplace. (iv) Performance reviews for the most part are opinion based (see 3 below) and not work based (v) Bullying/Level-ism. I've seen so much of it go on here and nothing done. (vi) Decisions a lot of the time are made from MPK and a lot of the time opinion based and not fact based which is scary. The 'Holier Than Though' engineering 'Move Fast' culture creates loads of chaos and is unnecessary. 3. You are goaled a lot on ""collaboration"" i.e. how much you are liked rather than the work you do or numbers you drive. This is a cult like characteristic where you have to be ""happy"" and ""always on."" I joined FB to work on projects to drive numbers but all my feedback was about how I got on with other people. Collaboration is important for most companies but it's fake at Facebook due to performance review system. 4. There are no formal processes for a lot of things in the company. The only analogy I have for Facebook is that it's like a big building, you go inside, peel back the wallpaper and all you will see is the pipes - the walls are missing. It's ""XFN this"" and ""XFN that"" so you reach out to teams to get things done and rely on ""collaboration"" rather than formal processes/business requirements. It's a huge surprise to me how it has gotten this far. I've seen parts of the operation down/backlogged for weeks on end due to bad planning but you can't complain about it because you won't be ""liked."" 5. GMS Summit - This event is a mix between Jonestown and being in North Korea. People stand up and applaud Zuckerberg when he comes on stage and don't sit down until he sits down.

What I love about it is I believe Facebook and its family of apps: Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, etc, and other technologies like it from other companies are transforming the medium of language, the medium of communication. I can remember being a young boy in the early 80's in a small city&nbsp;called&nbsp;Waterford, in the south of Ireland,&nbsp; being excited when introduced to the humble CD for the first time. I remember clearly the first mobile brick hand-phones, mpeg players, ipods, on and on and on.

Very poor work-life balance. I've never worked so much in my entire career, yet it never seems enough to satisfy the criteria to grow up internally. All internal systems are custom made and many times they compare poorly to open-source alternatives, specially from usability and stability perspective. Which means you will spend a long time to master the internal tooling and all that hard-earned knowledge will be worthless when you leave the company. Also, that all engineers have so much freedom means that everyone is constantly reinventing the wheel, and increasing the overall complexity of the environment thus changes harder and harder as time goes by. This is exacerbated by the bonus system, which for many years has encouraged engineers to build and deliver new things rather than fixing existing issues.

We get paid very competitively and the perks are amazing. The job itself is rather interesting as well. I love the very caring and chilled atmosphere in the office - coming from consulting, no overtime and no extreme pressure is really a big difference. Most of the people in the office are quite smart and really fun to work with. I also love how international the Dublin office is, before joining I didn't see it as something very important but now I understand why everyone from FB keeps mentioning that.","- The constant talk about growth. Facebook is not growing as fast as it used to, yet the company hires like crazy. To be honest I think this is too much at this point. All these people are doing ""projects"" but these projects are in 3/4 not useful at all. The sole purpose of them is that someone can write it in their performance review but no one really uses the outcome of the project after that. - Despite the management saying how international the company is, every decision is still taken by Americans/British/Irish and according to their worldview. Which sometimes has awful effects on the company image in countries that were not part of the Commonwealth or are the US. It's particularly visible when there is a PR fire in American or British media, they can change something overnight based on that not thinking about how it will impact other parts of the world. Also it's worth mentioning that a huge majority of managers is Irish/British, and there is little internal mobility for non-natives. - Performance review is somehow not fair. Technically there are career expectations but if you fulfil all of them, you'll get the lowest score. There are people from certain parts of the world that would be working 16h a day (I'm thinking East Asia in particular) to get the best score so then people from other parts of the world need to work longer as well, otherwise their achievements will look pale compared to those working overtime. And performance assessment, potential promotion and bonus, are based on your place on the curve rather than on whether you fulfilled criteria of your job. - Internal mobility rules are very unfair. As an external applicant you'd meet and even exceed all the criteria for a particular role but if you are internal you cannot move to a role that is higher grade than yours. This leads to a situations in which people who applied internally were rejected, left the company and were soon approached by recruiters for the very role on LinkedIn if they'd be interested.",Facebook

We call it a Faceversary. And, while celebrating your work anniversary might seem a bit frivolous (or at least I thought so early on), I quickly learned to appreciate the FB tradition that’s built around these Faceversaries. It’s valuable to reflect on all that happens in a year at work, considering how much energy, time, and effort we put into it. When you make it to your 10-year milestone (my count down starts now), you get the opportunity to join Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and others on the management team to tell a 10-year Faceversary story to the entire company.

With the excuse that you should 'focus on impact', people will fight for 'sexy' projects and things that will obtain them a good performance review. Since middle and upper management often do not have a clue about what their own teams actually do, whatever you can make sound important (e.g. with fake metrics or tales of potential impact), you are onto a winner. Unfortunately, the same managers do not enforce a culture of fairness or trust; instead, it is a culture of rewarding back-stabbers and people who 'get the work done' but who, at the same time, treat their colleagues poorly. By that, I mean stealing projects or not giving credit to those who get the work done, for example. It is an awful environment to work in. Some teams are worse than others as well: You could end up reporting into a bad apple who steals projects from you. It happens, and it happens often. Good people managers are never rewarded, as people management is not something Facebook recognises as important. Yes, in the orientation they will give you a big speech about it but when was the last time good people managers got promotions? Managers should focus on people, and ICs should focus on things. Unfortunately, bad managers who are good at IC work get rewarded often to the detriment of their teams, who have to suffer under people who should have never become people managers. The so-called Pulse survey is a joke, as no importance is given to low-scoring managers. If 10 people in a team say they would not work with their manager again, something must be wrong, don't you think? To any potential employees: Do not get fooled by the appearances. Facebook makes people feel trapped because they make you think this is the 'best' company and that you should be grateful you are part of Mark Zuckerberg's dream of making the world more 'open and connected'.

This also pressures people to work alone on highly measureable projects and not share the credit for larger projects. in the year and a half I've been with the company, I've seen 4 people fired in a 30~ person team, plus two more quit ahead of being fired.

Almost everything that should be provided is, without lengthy approval processes, unparalleled trust in employees at all levels (you don't need to be a bigwig to get perks). Employees are empowered to build anything, any app, service, feature. If you are a big fan of autonomy and self-driven growth, Facebook is the place to go. Managers don't bark orders or give commands, but spend the vast majority of their time as a support role, and encouraging leadership between engineers.","Can be intimidating at times, and coworkers definitely work a lot.

You have to set your own work-life balance, but flexibility exists to allow you to do so (you never feel intimidated to have to work long hours, it's more of a self-motivation question).",Facebook

They provide free breakfast, lunch and dinner which is pretty amazing.

Granted, its prime focus is to grab a bigger slice of pie from Google but that seems to be driving its entire business strategy. - Hyderabad undergoes re-orgs way too frequently, which has resulted in mass attrition with several senior managers moving on. - Under-hiring talent: There is no difference between the role/designation of an ISB MBA with 3 years of solid work ex and an undergrad fresher from a local college. HR needs to work out this motivational deterrent else attrition is set to rise. - Inverted pyramid hiring in the sales team: Way too many senior and mid-level managers are being hired as individual contributors for roles that are given to college grads in other locations.

1390,"""Amazing company""",5.0,"Great benefits - salary, food,training and atmosphere",hard to be promoted as some of the structures are very layered,Facebook
1391,"""I met different people, Different culture it was good.""",4.0,It has wide connections of different people and countries.,Works on Facebook takes almost your time,Facebook
1392,"""Absolute roller coaster""",5.0,"- If you are in sales: - there isn't a more exciting thing to sell or talk about with clients and marketers - huge advantage in terms of gaining access to clients - Great career opportunities especially for those that are willing to get involved in emerging teams and roles and get stuck in. - Great benefits and work environment, amazing people to work with. It'd be hard to work anywhere else. - Always launching something new both on the marketing front and for users. - Business side of the company aside, we're changing the way the world communicates.",- Work - life balance is difficult particularly for the ambitious. - So many moving parts at certain points that turns out different groups at different locations are working on the same problem. This can be helpful when it's an innovation/engineering problem but not as much when it is about business processes etc. - Developing tools to increase non-engineering employee efficiency not perceived as sexy but might be inhibiting growth.,Facebook

1395,"""Over-worked and under-valued, watching the bubble burst""",2.0,"Working in digital, social and mobile is without a doubt *the* sector to be in, in Ireland these days, which is a great plus. Your role in FB is (pretty much) safe, which is more than can be said in other realms of the advertising (or indeed business) world. You'll also meet some amazing people here, you'll forge some real friendships. In advertising teams, there is a great feeling of getting to know the right people, doing (some of) the right things. Perks like free meals are increasingly ubiquitous, but are still nice.","The hours you work and the pressure you are under make the remuneration meagre in comparison (especially seeing as share options, previously promised to balance out low salaries, are now worth so little). The post-IPO scramble has made many lose confidence in the forward thinking and strategy of top level management; lower level management often lacks the skills or will to deflect from the increasing corporate politics. In engineering teams, there is a cult-like mentality towards the infallible CEO.",Facebook
1396,"""best job ever""",5.0,"We could easily run out of space here. Facebook as a company, is like friend. I've my manager's constant attention on any issues I might come up with. The amount of benefits at Facebook is close to countless, starting from the small snacks, free food and basically everything that you can imagine. Once the company gave you everything you can think of, you have a wonderful place to work, with brilliant people on the most challenging problems.

We have employee from every country possible. - You are responsible for your work. Work as a team and complete your objectives. if you do that, you'll be fine. - Hackathons, Team Activities, Christmas Party, Happy Hour, ... All the reasons why working at facebook sometime feels like a hobby and not a job.","- Lack of communication with Palo Alto. - Not considered equal with US employees. - US employees have better salaries, better work conditions, and better benefits.",Facebook
