13,"""You must pay them  if you leave your job as an Advisor- rip off alert.""",1.0,I met some good people almost all have moved on to better jobs.,"Want to be an Advisor say no to this company, they send you an invoice after you leave. I am a 22 year veteran in the industry, I worked for this firm for 16 months the last 4-5 seeking a new situation. If you want to learn the business not here, if you have experience, do it anywhere but here. I produced, followed the rules, was promised management within 6 months with the kind of resume I had I was told that management would be an absolute in 6 months. The old bait and switch occurred, I got there and I produced as asked and exceeded the expectation, when I asked when would l I be moving to a managers role they changed the criteria and rules. I continued to produce and expand my practice. I trained every new person because the managers hire and abandon people, they have a ridiculous recruitment goal and no real incentive to develop their hires. I am mentoring/training people and continued producing very well. Despite the company mantra. “life pays the bills” meaning life insurance I was working on some life insurance and annuity cases but a lot of investment business which takes about 10 times longer to get done because they are not and will never be investment oriented as a firm. They only put in a CRM in 2016 because the DOL ruling forced their hand, they put in the most rudimentary version of Salesforce in place and expected all of us to stop production to enter clients, they could have hired data entry people for this at $12 an hour. This company has more ways to prevent you from doing business such as endless mandatory meetings, requests for data entry, endless training's in which they bring in someone who pontificates for 75 minutes and has not produced in years. Managers that are doing unscrupulous replacement of life insurance policies to produce commission for their hires and then they just stop that faucet flow after a few cases and leave them to call upon over worked brutalized clients that have had 5 Advisors in 3 years. Or they have them calling friends and family to buy insurance. Most of the managers that I met had so many issues/complaints on FINRA Broker Check you should never let them see your clients some even had assault and sexual assault reported on the criminal section of their FINRA File. Now here is the fun part, I decide I cannot work in the environment and I decide to leave, I am still producing because I have to get paid (this is all commission), I finally give notice and have smartly planned to have only $2800 left in my draw account. I am told that I would have to wait FOURTEEN WEEKS after my last day to receive my final paycheck. I am not happy but I wait, well 15 weeks go by and I call payroll to be told that I misunderstood, I will get a letter that is mailed after FOURTEEN WEEKS telling me what my paycheck would be and then I will get it on the next payroll date. I wait and the letter arrives 16 weeks after my last day. AND…. It tells me I owe Prudential $1958.22. There is a redacted statement explaining the inflow and charge backs for any advanced payment on commission that I had after I left the company. Funny thing is not one thing matched the spreadsheet that I produced for myself before I gave notice, not even close to the numbers I had, I called payroll and asked them if I sent them a blank piece of paper and it said, “send me $1958.22” would they send me a check? They said no, of course not, I asked them why they expected anyone to do just that? I had to ask four times for them to give me a deeper explanation and you would think they were giving me the launch codes for the nuclear arsenal. The information was still not enough to understand how I owed them money. I tried to reason with them and then I get a call from a law firm in Arizona trying to collect on me. So, my legal coverage at my new job is not fighting them for me, they also had to ask 7 times to get the contract they were reading because nowhere in the contract that I had did this little nugget appear and we still can’t find it because they refuse to send the document. So how do I owe them money and how did this happen? These slick managers call the clients tell them they have to see them, tell they that you left and they need new paper work signed. They get the cases assigned to… you guessed it some new hire that needs the commission to fulfill their obligation to get hired on contract. How do I know this? Someone that I am friends with in my old office was told this by a new hire who got other peoples cases. In my entire working life of over 35 years I have never ever been asked to pay for the privilege of working for a company. Especially a company that does not give me a paycheck, it is all commission, there is no expense reimbursement so all your gasoline, tolls and wear and tear on your car is your bill to carry. You can write it off however, you know that will never recoup all of the out of pocket. The benefits are so-so and expensive. In year two they throw you into a 1099 contract, you are entitled to benefits, 401(k) and they pay FICA but you are responsible for your own taxes. I saw 75-year-old agents still working there because they could not retire. Just the other day one of the young people that I mentored called me, he received a $300 invoice in the mail for his short 9 month stay at Prudential. They troll the internet, college campuses and job fairs, do not fall in the trap or you will go broke and owe them money in the end.",Prudential

45,"""Good for growth, not to stay""",3.0,"I worked in a shared-services group for nearly 10 years. Prudential is a great organization to be at early to mid-career and really learned how to navigate a large corporation. It's also a great place to work if you have or plan to start a family. There so many supporting perks to take advantage of that support growth: tuition reimbursement, training, telecommuting, commuter benefits, health insurance, flex spending, 401k match (3 yr vesting), volunteering opportunities and consumer discounts. Executives have a very good vision for where the company is heading and has great foresight which keeps a company that's been around for over 130+ years stable and secure. Like any company there's politics but if you work to be a good partner and deliver results that help at the team, group or organizational scale you earn great respect and will have a reputation that sticks. Working in Newark was not great in the beginning but during my last few years you could really see a noticeable difference in the surrounding area. Loads of places to go for lunch solo or for business meetings. If you work within the Plaza building on Broad Street, it's a great place to be. The building is the most up-to-date and has the best cafeteria that offering a large selection and specials that can span many ethnic dishes. Pay scale is comparable to most places but the annual incentive bonuses are excellent—definitely encourages employee retention.","Like every big corporation navigating the businesses and corporate groups can be daunting. I worked to primarily service all the businesses and corporate groups and there's no road map unless you can figure it out the intranet or have a good manager. I believe that could be handle with an official orientation; which I never received. The organizational size and structure seems overly complicated thus creating many layers of government (committees for every purpose) and long cycles for the fruits of you labor to see the light of day. You just have to ensure you have good day-to-day accomplishments to keep you grounded. There are people in roles so specific it shocks me. But if you go in another group or business a similar role may have a lot more or a lot less responsibility. Obviously you can't compare without knowing pay scale but those are some of the things that surprise me. There's a great understanding of how the company should be positioned but driving that vision is done in many assumed ways. Politics in the company vary from group to group but it's very much there. I found in most of my years there, very few leaders are leaders because of their proven results. It has been more talk-the-talk but can't necessarily walk it. The only issue with having a great annual incentive plan company wide is that it creates a culture of rushing to make sure performance goals are met prior year end. This tends to put a great deal of pressure on a shared service groups.",Prudential

They have some of the best benefits in the industry. Health, dental, vision, life, LTC, 401K, company sponsored retirement plans, and more. The have online and in person training 24/7. If you have the ability to hang in with them for the first four years, you should enjoy a lucrative and satisfying career. This is a great job for recent graduates who have minimal overhead, anyone with a strong desire to enter in to the lucrative financial industry,or an energetic well-connected retiree who wants to start up a second career (although it's grueling the first two years). Prudential is a well known and respected company and most people already know and trust 'The Rock'. For the most part they have remained above the fray and are on a seriously strong growth track financially. They have great products, and agents have access to numerous non-Prudential products so you can represent a wide range of options. The good thing about that is you have vast resources, the bad thing about that is you have endless options which can be overwhelming until you learn how to access the right people and resources to help you provide the right solution for your client. It's all available to you, you just need to be able to sort through the endless amount of information quickly and tirelessly.","To get hired with Pru you have 26 weeks to acquire your Life & Health, Series 6 & 63 licenses and you must sell $5000 of GDR (policy totals and at least 5 sales) before you are considered an employee and this will be at your own expense. There is an initial Intelligence Profile test which is extremely challenging and takes over an hour. Depending on how you score, they can apparently determine how well you'll do with passing your exams and succeeding in the business in general. I scored 87% which was considered high but many score in the 50%. Anything less than 50% is generally not acceptable. The exam process is brutal, with Life & Health being the 'easiest' to pass, and the 6 & 63 the toughest. Many people do not pass the first time, and they will only reimburse you the first one. You are responsible for paying for all exam materials and all other costs until you finish your requirements and at that point they reimburse you quickly. Many people do not make it through this process especially if they have financial pressure or work full time. It is extremely time consuming so be prepared to sacrifice a few months of your life. After filling out a detailed application listing every possible job and place you've lived and disclosing anything negative in your financial or personal history, they will do a thorough background check before the SEC does a criminal check and fingerprinting. To hold a securities license you must bare your soul. But the good news is, they understand life happens, so just be honest and communicate and hope for the best. While you're doing all of this they have what are called 'PLN's' which are endless and can feel overwhelming. They are basically online education about everything having to do with the highly scrutinized securities industry. Some are quick and easy to get through and many are not. You will read about products and ethics and on and on, finish with a short test and then it's filed in your information. It's a way for them to protect themselves and to provide intensive training. You won't learn much from them because you need to get through them so quickly and there are always hundreds more no matter how many you manage to do and time is always of the essence with Pru (good time management skills are imperative). After you've finished all of this and graduate to a full time employee, you are paid on commission. You start out with your $5000 GDR (usually 45% of GDR depending on the product you sold) and they put all commissions in a 'bucket' to be dispersed in equal amounts ($1200 every two weeks) unless you go over the $4800 minimum in you bucket. They give you quotas which are very high but do-able, and if you reach your quotas they have very generous bonuses. Pru will give you 'orphan ' leads in return for certain expecttions. These are people who haven't had an agent in years, have probably already been called, and are generally far away, but they are warm bodies with some potential for a sale. You are expected to make hundreds of phone calls every week and you should have 12 to 15 appointments per week. They also want you to brand yourself in your community so it means going to network meetings, church involvement, charity work, etc. They teach you to have an 'elevator speech' and so every person you meet is a potential 'client'. You need to be able to talk to strangers and try to sit down with them for coffee and put them in your ever growing pipeline for follow up. They are in the process of switching to SalesForce which is free, but any regular contact like newsletters, advertising, marketing, etc. is paid for by the agent. They have lead programs where you can buy leads from them but you may or may not ever get any leads. A good way to find people wanting to buy insurance right away is by purchasing leads from independent companies. The cheapest leads ($10) will be shared with 3 to 5 other agents so everyone is calling the client who just went online for a quote, or exclusive leads which are upwards of $25 per lead. They have a higher closing ratio and can get you to your bonus goals which theoretically pay you back your investment. In a nut shell, you need to determine if this kind of job is a good fit for you. It will be probably the hardest job entry you'll ever experience, but that alone can be rewarding. It's a good long term career, or a good stepping stone if you have the fortitude.",Prudential

Difficult job if you don't know many people with money or in the need of your services. You'll end up hustling your friends. If a sale falls through at the wrong time you'll end up in the hole for your pay. Life insurance is something people are not willing to spend a lot of money on so I didn't make too much. The real money in this job is in investments and annuities. I was able to partner up with some very talented agents and make some decent sales with decent commission checks. I ended up taking a few weeks off for personal reasons (totally scheduled and expected) and I was unable to recover and was not willing to work for zero compensation and still be expected to pay for my gas to go on appointments.,Prudential

The company also provides a good deal of benefits, beyond the typical healthcare plan, such as a 401K, pension plan, a robust employee discount program for a multitude of commercially available products (e.g. cell phone companies), etc. Management is very conscientious about treating employees fairly and making the company a good place to work. Little things like, free tea and coffee, which are available all day (self-serve) in the kitchenette areas located on every floor. They even provide self-serve medicine cabinets on every floor, stocked with over-the-counter meds such as Tylenol, Ibuprofen, cough drops, throat lozenges, etc. They are also flexible and supportive of moms with young kids. For example, they provide lactating rooms for moms who are breastfeeding, will work with you to come up with flexible hours, and even support temporary part-time arrangements. Operationally the company is very structured. I guess they have to be due to all the regulatory oversight imposed on large financial institutions. The structure is great if you like work environments with highly defined roles and responsibilities, though entrepreneurial types might find the environment overly restrictive, with little to no latitude for making discretionary job related decisions. My biggest cultural observation is that nearly all matters and business considerations (large and small) require cross-functional agreement before they can move forward. On the plus side this drives cross-functional unity and quality decisions that aren't questioned or blocked late in a process. There is also a down side, though. See discussion under Cons. Compensation can be regarded as competitive when viewed from the perspective of the total package (healthcare, salary, paid time off, tuition reimbursement, other perks), but don't expect the company to be at the top of the leader-curve with respect to salary alone.","The need to get cross-functional decision making buy-in from multiple groups/functions can be time consuming and frustrating. Allow very long lead times for any decisions required to move forward, as team reviews, changes, and re-reviews can take awhile. There is no clear path for advancement. Many people I spoke with made what I perceived to be a disproportionate number of cross-functional lateral moves versus upward job changes. The company encourages lateral movement as it makes for more rounded, valued employees. Great for the company, but is it in the best interest of the individual? The company has a CYA culture.

The branding is an asset, as are the health benefits. 7-14% Bonus to make up for the other half of broker commission, and the Cubicle Leasing Fees. Loyal Orphaned Leads","In my experience, I was hired into an office with a recently demoted Manager of Financial Services who was not replaced the entire 9 months I was there. I was provided mentoring by a brand new ""Manager in Training,"" who did his best, but who was out on the road selling all day himself. Prudential's compensation is vague - what you'll get paid on, etc. They have you e-mail a human FAQ who gets back to you within two days with a general answer. There is no phone number, nor is there anything concrete in their compensation handbook. You really have to be obsessive/compulsive about getting paid. My office also had an odd location - a county in a state which bordered other states West, East, and North. We did not receive leads in a radius, which caused us to drive hours, which in turn, limits the ""number game"" of seeing enough clients. As a broker, you can buy leads ~$200/mo, and get paid $6000 at 100% street commision. As an agent, leads are provided, get paid $3000 at 45-50% agent commission, and PAY $400 per month to lease your space. As if it wasn't enough that you work directly for, and are captive to Prudential, they take half the commission given to someone who has no loyalty (broker,) then pay $400 per month on top for ""Agency Support Fees."" Luckily, there is a lower $300 support fee, where you enjoy the top of your desk, but they lock the drawers, in a mostly empty office. Essentially, if a Broker makes $100k, they keep their book of business and can sell other products at full commission. In the above example, you make $50k, you do not own your book of business, and you cannot sell any other products, except for a Sponsored Outbrokerage program, from which they take roughly half the commission as well. That's $50,000 you lose for being captive over a broker, and $4800 you PAY for the agency support. There's plenty of money to be made - just not on the side of the agent.",Prudential

The best thing about the position is the freedom and potential for high commissions.","When I was brought into the position, how I would get paid description was nowhere near reality. Your pay structure is nearly 100% commissions. I was told it would be 60% commissions and the rest in bonuses, but in reality it was more like 90% commissions and only 10% bonuses. Was never told how pay would be captured if clients changed their minds up to 6 months of policy dates. We worked for a mostly life ins. agency and it was sell, sell, sell. Many times I saw things that would not be ethical to say the least. Clients were lied to on a weekly basis just to make a sale. It all began with management. Prudential seems to be in the business to jsut get a person to come in, work 2-4 years, get them to sign everyone they know in the world, and then hopefully they leave after 4 years. Nothing about how our agency was constructed, had any intent on keeping people in the business after 4 years, and this was passed down from home office. Everything was done to keep them there and then wash their hands with them after 4 years. From the high fees you had to pay as an experienced rep, to the low bonus grids that were available to you after 3-4 years. Horrible work environment, and almost everyone seemed to be working against you. Many cases of coworkers sitting down with your clients behind your back and never telling you. I was brought in with the intention of making over ""$200K after your 3rd-4th year"". I should have known better. In an agency of 80 people, only 4-5 people ever made over $150K/year. These 4-5 people had been with the company for well over 5 years and no one was making $300K after their 5th year with company as was briefly mentioned during the hiring process. My recommendation is, if you do not have a natural market you can work, do not even try and attempt this field. In years of working there, I saw so many poor souls come in, charge a ton of money on their credit cards to buy leads since they had no natural market, and fail miserably after 6mnths, forcing them to resign. Also, no matter how bad you are doing production wise, unless you do illegal things, they will not fire you within the first 4 years so they don't pay any sort of unemployment. Even after 4 years, they will ask you ""kindly"" to resign yourself, and politely warn you that it looks worse if they fire you vs. resigning.",Prudential

This is done mostly because someone doesn't like someone. There is a great deal of favoring work friends by management, meaning if an open position is posted, a managers friend who is not qualified would be offered the position vs someone who was qualified (I've seen this happen so many times). Management will, at times, brush issues that are brought to their attention under the rug vs attempting to correct the problem.

Also a requirement to get out of CDP is to hit a certain level of production ($6,000 GDR/annual premiums AND 5 core products I.e. life policies and annuities). Wrote a huge life insurance case for $8,000 annual premium? Too bad, still need to write 4 more policies in order to get paid for it! Long story short, you'll go through the first 3-5 months without being paid and busting your ass between 40-70 hours per week with absolutely nothing to show for, including any company benefits. What happens if you don't meet the requirements within the given time frame? See you later, and no $$ for you! Also, the veterans in the office will prey on you and try to take you on ""joint appointments""with your friends and family to get a portion of your commissions. They aren't stupid, they know that 9/10 newbies will be gone within a year and they want a piece of your pie. If/when you do graduate from the CDP program, you finally start getting paid, business cards, and begin to finally feel like a real employee. Keep in mind that you are not a financial advisor, you are a life insurance salesman first and might get lucky and write an annuity or some mutual funds in the process. BUT, anybody who has any money to invest has already done so with an actual advisor from Edward Jones, Merrill Lynch, etc who can actually write the same exact Prudential annuities and mutual funds themselves. You will undoubtedly be given huge lists of ""orphan""clients (Pru customers whose salesman had left the company so they don't have a servicing rep), which you will call on blindly. You will soon find that about 95% of them either -have been contacted within the last year and don't want to talk to anybody from Pru because they've been screwed by somebody in the past. -will reluctantly meet with you, which ends up in changing beneficiaries for their $5,000 30 year old policy I.e. No money for you and a lot of wasted gas and 2 hours of your time. -want to hear about how you can help them with retirement, only to find out they either have no money or somebody else has done a Pru annuity for them from a different company. So, you will probably get face to face with lots of people, and regardless of how great of a salesman you are, people will act interested and ultimately do nothing or go elsewhere for business. You will be expected to buy leads, marketing materials, and anything else that will help you to stay from scratch to hopefully survive in this company, and not get reimbursed for any of it. I would say I've spent about half of the money I've earned to just barely stay afloat and keep business coming in. People who need life insurance either can't afford it or are wayyyy too unhealthy to qualify for it. People who can afford it and are healthy enough already have it. People are scared to death of annuities, or they already have one with somebody else. People who are looking to save for retirement or their child's education either will or have already done so elsewhere. People look at Pru as a life insurance company, not a company that will lead them to retirement. Before you think to yourself ""this guy is bitter/poor salesman/lazy/doesnt produce"" let me just say that I've been here 2+years, hit every sales goal and bonus I've been challenged to hit, and networked like crazy working minimum 50 hours/week to barely make $30, 000 a year. Which, like I mentioned, I have spent roughly half of putting money back in to my practice to move forward. If you have sales experience, a boatload of patience, a family/friends with tons of money and trust you, and a good amount of money in savings before starting, then MAYBE take this job and pray to whatever god it is you pray to. If you don't have ALL of these things I mentioned, run far far away and don't fall into the traps and lies that management will surely feed you along the interview process. They get paid for hiring people and retaining people who produce at a certain level, so when you sign the contract it's money on their pocket. When you do write business, it will be picked through with a fine toothed comb. Cases will surely get rejected, which means money you thought you made will be taken right out of your draw account for the most ridiculous reasons you can imagine. It amazes me the opposing forces within the company of produce produce produce and ""oh, sorry, we can't approve this case that you just worked your ass off for and in no way puts the client in a poor situating"" So, in 2 words, GOOD LUCK!",Prudential

The company claims to be searching for new investment strategies but continues to produce the same vanilla results. VERY few new ideas have been produced in the past 10 years. Most funds find themselves chasing the market and implementing outdated strategies.

Documents get bounced around departments, then to one advisory committee, then to another committee, then to outside counsel, then to senior management, then up to Prudential Investment Management (PIM), then to a final committee and finally some watered down result is produced. This bureaucracy results in many lost deals and the smothering of any progressive thinking. Additional internal compliance procedures created after the market crash just make it that much worse. 3) Content - 'It worked 15 years ago so it should work now' mentality. Most senior managers still sport the Cosby sweater to give you an idea... 4) Upward movement - Typically takes just shy of 4 years to be promoted to an associate from analyst. Very slow career progression due to no turnover at the top. 5) Compensation - Very weak relative to its peers in institutional real estate. Starting analysts at $60k when they can work in the city for $80k 6) Location - Senior Managers really knew how to tick off its junior employees by moving the office to a farm in the middle of Madison, NJ a solid 45 min to an hour commute from the city and an hour and a half commute by train AND THEN shuttle. 7) Due to points 5 & 6, the talent pool is weak. The trailblazers that built the company are now just sitting atop the heavy fees they retain from the PRISA funds and are more like lame ducks. The company will never be able to bring in and retain young talent due to the lack of compensation, the company's horrible location, and the inability to move up within the company. In order to get promoted you feel like you're waiting for someone to retire. 8) Senior management is out of touch with the younger analysts and associates. The extremely high turnover at the analyst level has resulted in a disconnect between managers and younger staff. 9) Very pretentious crowd - Everyone seems to have 1st world problems.

I was fortunate to have a manager who was very supportive of me (even taking money out of his own pocket to help me buy leads or lunch - just unbelievably admirable of a guy) up until the end when I just couldn't survive anymore. If you have a large warm market, then you can survive the beginning. However, if you can't get good referrals, then you will not last much longer after your warm market dries up. There is the chance to move up to management if you can survive two years.

Financial services is a very clustered type industry, often times you will run into multiple companies in the same territory areas you working in. Often when I went to city chamber events, other reps not only from my own office would be there, but also from other companies. Sometimes half of the people at the chamber event would be insurance and financial services people. From what I understood, I was one of the last to get into the program where the company pays a small weekly salary of $400 while studying for licensing (Series 6/63) and training - this was for 10 weeks. After that, there is a draw of $3600 you can pull from - that lasted about six weeks. Once your draw is done, and if you haven't gotten enough sales, you might be screwed. Although some managers are great and trust worthy, others are not so much. Upper management may even make your life more difficult as it truly is a ""What have you done for me lately"" mentality. Although Pru offers great products with a strong name attached, they are somewhat expensive. My warm market was made up of Blue Collars who just couldn't see spending that kind of money on the products I was able to offer; often times they ended up going with a lower cost alternative and I couldn't blame them as sometimes it was half the cost for a similar product like a 30 Year Term Policy.",Prudential

In my opinion, the lack of a base also incentivizes less scrupulous agents to make unsuitable recommendations, especially with regards to annuity sales. -Compensation structure is mind-bogglingly confusing to most new reps, especially with regard to the first-year support credits. -Absolutely no help with start-up costs; if you want an extra pen and some paper clips, be prepared to pay for them. Likewise, no transportation expense reimbursement, so when you drive an hour and the client doesn't pull the trigger, you lost both the sale and the gas money. -Training and support exercises are good at first, but become tedious, repetitive and time-consuming as you get into the role, but attendance is still expected. -Trail commission rates on life insurance are pretty rough, meaning new business is the only way to make serious money on life insurance sales. -Partners for P&C may have poor rates, depending on the state you're in, making it hard to build a renewal stream. -Maximum draw amount is set very high for new reps, meaning you have to hit some pretty solid numbers to take home more than the minimum draw. -Management support can be spotty and the company provides very few quality leads to new reps.

The heavy workload is the reason people seek different opportunities within Prudential or leave the company. There is quota of claims that need be processed on a weekly basis as well as quality assurance review. The quota of claims that need to be processed can be rather difficult to achieve due to various factors. If you are a strong performer, management could reassign you to handle more complex client claims and it is impossible to obtain your quota. Than you are penalized.

Under this economic conditions it is very hard to still find companies that offer good benefits, professional growth and work -life balance. It is true that each business has a different culture and it depends where are you at. In my experience, the culture has a lot to do with how happy you are at work. In my current division they foster professional growth, it's all in your hands and what you want to make out of it is all in yr hands. Senior Management shares what is going on in the market and within the company. Tuition reimbursement is part of the benefits too. Pru has set in place recognition programs that foster a great work environment and promote recognition within peers. The compensation may not be as high at the beginning, bu as you gain experience and get more credentials, more doors will open for you and you'll get more money. Also, the work /balance that they offer is a big plus. I feel that Pru really cares about employees and helps communities all over. Newark will be something very different if Pru wouldn't be there. All in all, I love working for a company that does so much good to the community.","The pay can be lower at entry-level.

542,"""Prudential is one of the best places to work!""",5.0,"I have been with Prudential 25 years now in a variety of different roles and business groups. Prudential has an enormous amount of opportunities for the hard-working, qualified, and motivated employees. If you are not satisfied with Pru it is likely your own fault and you should look within yourself and your job performance. Unfortunately too many people today feel a sense of entitlement - grow up! You aren't entitled to anything you don't work hard for. And, if you are unfortunate enough to work for management who doesn't recognize your hard efforts - post out! Another wonderful Prudential benefit is the job posting board - you are eligible to post after you have been in an assignment for at least a year. You are the only one who has control over your career. Prudential has personally offered me many growth and diversified opportunities. I climbed the ""ladder"" so to speak through hard work, dedication and motivation and not for any other reason. If I was ever in an area where I didn't respect management I took ownership of my career and posted out. Prudential also offers one of the best work-life balance programs a company can offer to employees. There are so many flexible working options offered to the high performers, which is one of the top reasons I stay with the company - it is a priceless benefit to have.","Lack of consistency between management. I have observed management across lines of business are not consistent with how they manage people. Some areas fully support benefits such as work/life balance and others do not even consider it. Same with compensation. Prudential has a very generous compensation plan. We are all highly paid for what we do. The decisions on compensation, however, are very subjective and inconsistent strategies are used in the varying HR departments. Being in management I think I also have a right to say that too many managers ignore employee issues and do not take the courage to confront the issues and help empoyees grow.

Even though the written policies emphasize the importance of work-life balance, the examples set by many managers tend to discourage people from taking advantage of the policies. Lack of clear direction from middle management. Projects are often begun with insufficient and even inaccurate information. Too much emphasis is placed on meeting deadlines versus actually having all the information to execute well. A high degree of siloing makes it hard to get the big picture view of a project.

Overall, management support is pretty good. Managers are available to assist you with cases and so forth, as are veteran agents. The training and career development is outstanding. The first 10 weeks are spent getting trained and licensed. There are also abundant opportunities to earn free continuing education and support to earn professional designations. There is a culture of joint work, which means you see clients with senior agents to learn how they do things. Most of the time, commissions are shared, as is credit toward the mandatory checkpoints. The atmosphere is pretty good, too. FSAs tend to get along with each other and are supportive. The rest of the office staff is available to help solve problems and is also supportive of our goals.","This is not an easy job. The checkpoints involve a certain amount in annual premium, which are not always easy to make when you work with a veteran agent who takes a significant cut. Also in terms of veteran agents, some of them will use FSAs to do their prospecting and client service. Granted, sales from prospecting are generally shared, but service is not and it can take a lot of time and aggravation. Some of the veterans won't return client phone calls, so you're stuck taking them, getting an earful of yelling, and helping them anyway. This is also not an easy job if you have a family. Most of the successful FSAs tend to be single people, or if they're married, they have no kids or a stay-at-home wife. You are expected to work as long as you need to to make sure you've got your required minimum appointments, many of which tend to be in the evenings and on weekends. If work-life balance is important to you, this won't be a good fit. Management also tends to take ideas from other offices, which is fine, but there's little, if any, follow-through or troubleshooting if those ideas don't work out. FSAs are also expected to contribute financially to these projects, which is fine, but the return on investment is kind of low.

Management is unrealistic in their expectations without giving the agents the tools and training that is required to meet expectations.
