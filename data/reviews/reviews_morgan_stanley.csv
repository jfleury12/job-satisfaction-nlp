I wasn’t really listened to all they cared about was performance and not morale. There was also an instance when we lost a member of our team. It’s managements responsibility to hire a new replacement.

However, Advisors are able to give feedback about their support staff. Management never solicits feedback from support staff about Financial Advisors, so depending on whom you work for, your life could be miserable and management doesn't take steps to bring that in line, nor solicit feedback from others. Basically, the only time you will work directly with your manager is when you come in for a review annually, where you're told what your current Financial Advisors think of you. (Which is the only time you'll ever work with your manager--NO ""one-on-ones"" quarterly like at other firms, no coaching, no growth opportunities. As a support staff member, you'll only hear what your Financial Advisors say about you--but they aren't your managers, they aren't trained HR professionals, and you'll only hear what they say about you from your manager.

Also, you need to be very ok with grey areas, doing things you’re uncomfortable with for wrong reasons. Appearance/politics most important - for example, on a regular basis, mgmt would rather make a wrong decision quickly without accurate info or enough facts and even when better decisions are proposed at the same time by the team or by an individual behind closed doors. Why? Mgmt would rather appear to be decisive, save face, stand by their decision, and have the team waste time by following that bad approach/decision...inevitably, when it’s beyond clear the bad decision is bad, mgmt proposes a “new” (I.e. original suggestion by the individual/team) decision as their own, doesn’t apologize or admit their mistake (ever) and the team starts all over again. In spite of that, mgmt still wants the work yesterday and demands the team meet the same deadline (even though they caused several days to be wasted already). This is almost always announced at 5 or 6pm even though they’d already changed their decision that morning! Similarly, mgmt is more comfortable with communicating incorrect info both internally and externally for appearance (rather than getting back with an answer - because then it doesn’t appear as if they’re all-knowing) and so they can take the opportunity to “look good” in front of peers and those more senior.

Make sure that you have a sponsor with a rising star at the firm from Day 1. ""Who you know matters a lot more than what you know"", applies very well here. On a related note, many functional leaders lack the basic product knowledge so staff (VPs and below) does all the heavy lifting which can be wonderful if you believe in, ""If it does not kill you, it makes you stronger.""","Most large banks are under severe regulatory scrutiny which has translated into lots of pressure on employees, especially ones in the back office functions like Finance and Risk. MS has been struggling to meet its commitments to the street for a few years and that does not help anyone working there. Front office bankers and some functional leaders are not making as much as they used to and their disgruntlement translates into a pressure cooker environment for all the support staff. Lots of times junior employees in risk functions are asked to cooperate with business and other teams when the regulators expect risk functions to be impartial and diligent. This could be a career limiting move for everyone, especially for those trying to build a long term career without enough leverage. Promotions and salary hikes are awarded based on leverage primarily based on personal affiliations and preferences rather than merit. Don't believe HR or anyone else if they tell you otherwise. HR is the leader of labor cost reduction initiatives and under a lot of resultant pressure.",Morgan Stanley

Cost cutting galore.""",1.0,Free coffee and the mistaken belief among college grads that this is some prestigious organization.,"The current management has systematically destroyed any semblance of morale at the firm. There is little transparency or job security. In Purchase, the HQ for Wealth Management, senior management has their own private underground parking lot, private elevator, private cafeteria, and private floor. There are no town halls, and the most I have seen in the form of communication from Wealth Management leadership in the last six months was a pre-recorded 9 minute video. In an era where we aspire to work for companies with inspiring leaders who communicate openly and often, leaders we can trust and look up to, Morgan Stanley has decided to head in the completely opposite direction. I have seen dozens of VPs, EDs, and MDs leave the firm in the past year, many through annual cullings, and the remaining just got fed up and left. Just in the past year, I have seen three of my former managers leave the firm, all of whom had been with MS for 10-20 years. Things are bleak. Current leadership has no idea how to generate a profit, so instead they have been laying off people and asking 1 to do the work of 3. If you are thinking of joining this firm, don't. I was promoted to VP, was asked to manage multiple teams, and travel all around the country to speak at conferences, but despite all this I am worse off financially today than when I joined. Also don't trust all the planted glowing reviews on this site. The mood in the offices is the complete opposite of what is written here. And for all you summer interns out there, you have been warned. I have seen even some of the most shining summer analysts that accepted a full time position get discouraged after a few years and leave for greener pastures.",Morgan Stanley

In your first year, you get paid a higher rate than your third year. That's right. You initially make more in base pay + rate of commission, compared to, say fifth year. It's a downward pay rate slope. Because it's understood that you should have a larger AUM as time goes on. It's designed to pay upfront in first year, then decreases significantly.
