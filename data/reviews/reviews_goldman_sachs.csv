Good for the resume.,"Where to start...worklife balance is essentially non-existent. 50-60 work weeks are pretty much the norm. Expect some weeks to be even longer. You really don't have vacation, I was expected to work remotely even though I was taking vacation or sick days. Which in turn would make me more sick and miss coming in more because I couldn't really rest. I would find myself working on projects for my managers, only to have them receive the credit and I wouldn't get any credit. You do get a decent salary, but there are really no benefits. You have to pay for parking, transportation, and any other ""perks"" offered. So in the end, your total take home pay really isn't a lot if you are at the analyst level, or even associate. The only benefit for working at Goldman would be at the Vice President or higher level. This is the level where the company actually will care about you. To move up to the top you pretty much need to dedicate your life to work, not have a family (which I have), and kiss up to the right people. This organization is extremely political, if this isn't your thing, don't expect to move up. The company uses a quartile system for performance. Which means even if everyone in your division is great, you can still be rated as a ""low end"" performer just because everyone else happens to be better than you. I found during my time there people in the company were encouraged to put others on the team down and be overly critical and nit-picky just so they could get a higher rating. This caused the environment to be extremely toxic. I found that the team as a whole did not work well together and in some cases were sabotaging each other's projects so that they would be marked down. Recruiters can deceive you. This might not be for all cases but I will share what happened with me and a factor for me leaving Goldman. A heavy selling point for me was that continuing education was paid for to an extent, but for me to get my MBA, it would pretty much be paid for. So with that as a ""perk"", I decided to expect a position at Goldman. Once I was eligible for the benefit, I approached my manager about pursuing this. Long story short, they said that would not be in their best interest as getting the MBA would ""take time away from me doing my job"" and that they have never given any one the benefit because ""everyone would take advantage of it."" I thought this was extremely shady on there end because recruiting sold the benefit as being widely used and easy to be approved for.

When I compare how I was before Goldman to after, I'm much more organized, focused, and precise. There's no room for imperfections as any mistake can have catastrophic consequences, and that mentality is hard to let go even when you leave! I also met some wonderful, brilliant people who challenged me, and I'm grateful to have gotten to work side by side with them.","Now where do I begin... There is a deep deep foundation of inequality between men and women. Women are hired more often for certain roles rather than others, and not surprisingly those roles top out at VP rather than Managing Director or Partner like the roles that are more often held by men. Last year on national women's day (or a comparable made up holiday), we got an email from the executive office stating that they recognized the disparity between men and women at the firm, and in an effort to remedy that, they would be endeavoring to hire 50/50 men vs. women in the incoming analyst class...... This hollow attempt at a solution just floored me. It felt like throwing a limp soggy bandaid on a gaping wound. The problem isn't that you aren't hiring enough female analysts at the bottom of the ladder--the problem is that you aren't enabling women to stay in the workforce and move UP the ladder. Better yet, you aren't holding men to the same standards that you hold for women who seek the same promotions. For example, a good friend of mine spent ten years at the firm. She had multiple credentials behind her name, had recently gotten her MBA, and spoke up about wanting to make the switch to a separate position with more responsibility and room for upward mobility (also a role overwhelming held by men). Management told her that they were instead going to give her a different role that they'd just created--something sort of halfway between what she'd been doing already and what she wanted to do. Simultaneously, there was a guy who had been hired at the firm straight out of college, who'd been there two years and had no advance degrees but walked around with his chest puffed out, and management decided that he WOULD be a good fit for the same role that my friend was trying to get into. For what it's worth, this wasn't something that they were just hiring one person for but rather they were accumulating many candidates to train for the program all at once, so there was definitely room for the both of them at the onset. My friend kept fighting and finally she was given the okay to go into the program, but they'd managed to ruin the whole thing for her in the process. She ended up making the decision to leave the firm and is much better off now... But it was certainly an eye opening experience for me. If you're a woman, expect to work ten times as hard for the same opportunities. Additionally, and this is particularly timely given the recent cultural awareness provided by #metoo, if you're a woman, you can expect to get touched inappropriately by men that you work with. It's literally just something that you get used to. I'd be talking to my friends in other industries about this one guy who always puts his hand on my lower back or the other one that would rub my shoulders, and they'd be SHOCKED. Another dude would always find a way to get close to me at office happy hours and find some way to touch me. Meanwhile I was just used to laughing it off! Another time, a male supervisor reprimanded me for ""not bothering to put on some earrings"" before a client meeting. Mind you I was wearing makeup, a tailored Armani skirt suit, low Louboutin heels, and had done my hair, but that wasn't put together enough for him! He was wearing.... a suit. My work friends and I would all share stories over drinks, but we all knew that nothing was going to be done about it. Management was already aware, but the primary offenders were the rich white dudes that kept their business afloat (in their eyes), so there was no touching them (pun intended). How about another one... After my first year, I had exceedingly positive feedback in my 360 Feedback (the word ""allstar"" was used multiple times by multiple aforementioned important white men) and yet I got a 3% raise. A male peer had been hired a week after me in the same role, had made multiple mistakes that cost the firm money, and got a 6% raise (yes, we discussed these things). His bonus from the firm was also twice what I got. A year later the same guy was fired after he CONTINUED to make mistakes, and I was promoted to a different title but again only got a 3% raise. For anyone who is want to say that women make less because they don't negotiate, I can promise you I fought tooth and nail for a higher raise, and was given a YOU'RE WELCOME with my measly 3%. If you're pretty and you're smart, you won't have any trouble making friends, but you WILL have a hard time getting ahead. I wish I'd known ahead of time!",Goldman Sachs

They assured me several times they would since they were a competitive company, and had a reputation. This was not the case. Here are the facts I did not know until AFTER I was hired, and the events that took place: From day one, training is serious. It is intense and you must pay attention and pass exams; study hard. If you don’t pass, they will work with you if you show the determination, otherwise they will let you go. There are a series of exams: written, oral, and hands on, and it’s unnecesarily extensive. They don’t provide any lunch or snacks at all, esp for your first day; you’re on your own. It is a call center, though smaller. You must work a MANDATORY 40 + hours a week, and no less. That appointment you needed to go to, or that errand to run? You can go, but you will have to make it up in that week in overtime of cutting your lunch hours, otherwise you will be fired. My schooling? They refused to work with me on that specifically, and even when I went, I had to make up the time, forcing me to drop the class by mid semester; my last english class. You are monitored and expected to be at your desk performing 7 hours a day; the computers track what is called your adherence. If you are not following this strictly, esp with assigned breaks within a few minutes’ time, you will be fired. I recently received a lecture for using the restroom off break time, and how I ought to control that. The same lecture was given in training. The coffee is the most awful thing you’ll ever have there, and though few poeple drink it out of desperation, and many complain, no one does anything about it; they are also CONSTANTLY breaking! Some go unfixed for months at a time. The accommodations I needed were not given. In terms of ergonomics, it took months to receive the necessary equipment, and in terms of having a sit/stand installed... it arrived after six weeks, but delisted emails and such, it’s still not been installed. I was moved to a desk that already had one, finally. Most of those you work with dislikes their job, and it’s very taboo, but known. They start because the benefits are good, but that’s it. The environment is immensely stressful, and too much pressure is out on the employees for more, more , more even beyond breaking points. When I called the HR hot line to speak with a counselor, they told me they had no sick thing (they do, but I found out over a week later after investigating again). My first doctor under the insurance network, upon meeting me, looked st my chart and said “Goldman Sachs, eh?? We get quite a few people from there, here, for stress.” There is no such thing as work-life balance. You are expected to dedicate yourself in almost your entirety to them, and your life/family revolves around them. Much is expected from you, but little, it at all, is given back. No other incentives like prizes, pizza, snacks really, unless it’s out of pocket. The leadership is very poor in terms of praise or affirmation; you constantly shown what you are doing wrong , not right. I started with this company with high hopes and expectations, for they were fed to me. However, I’m currently looking for another job as this place is highly disappointing. Everyone works very hard, but again, little is given back. The high up management seem to be optimistic and encourage you, but then those below them could care less about you beneath; it’s whatever they can gain for themselves that matters. However, I give credit that my immediate managers are very good and learning to listen. It’s the ones above them that don’t care. The outlook continues to go downhill or plateau from here; it apparently was more lax and fun when the department started; now it’s unbearable with the unrealistic work loads and pressure. Compared to other departments, we seem to be the step-child in terms of being heard or ignored. If you truly enjoy working a lot and dedicating yourself almost wholly to a company that will invest in you otherwise, then this job is for you. They will invest in you, but only if you give them 200%, no less. They only expect the best , if not then better, and then even better, from you. They will not stoop “down” for your needs to bring you “up;” you must meet them upward first.” *update* Since I have left, more and more employees have quit, and after moving homes, switching childrens' schools and cancelling parking passes in order for the department to move to draper as promised this October, overnight an email was sent postponing everything for another month; company has not compensated employees for anything, not even parking. Employees that were hired into a specific job were moved to another against their will, despite contract agreement.

There's a lot of things that Silicon Valley companies could learn from how GS runs its business. Since career progression for junior employees is largely based on arbitrary metrics like number of years out of school, if you have a BA vs MA vs PhD vs MBA etc., in certain situations when you're transitioning from a different career path you can actually get pretty nice pay for your experience, even though overall GS pay doesn't seem that great.","The pay for junior employees really doesn't compare to what big tech is paying these days. You could double the bonus and it still wouldn't be able to match FANG pay. You can tell that the new grads and interns coming into tech/strats are not really the best. Then again, this is probably by design, but it's not great if you're an employee. The perks do need some upgrading IMO, for morale reasons. The cafeteria and vending machines are not exactly cheap, and being able to afford the more expensive snack/food items unintentionally signals your status/income level.

Top performing Technology Analysts and Associates were paid more than top performing VPs in the same team/many teams. It is good news to see an adjustment to pay for analysts and associates to match big tech, but demotivating to existing top performing VPs with way more years of experience to know analyst total comp was higher. Titles don't mean much now. Titles control base pay, but bonuses are at discretion of Managing Directors and this is what make the difference in pay at end of year.

However for the division I work in I see a few issues. One being that management talks behind the backs of the employees. Also that if someone is not doing well in the division, it's openly known on the floor. I've had one co-worker who had really no business knowing another co-workers standing talking to me about ""His numbers"" and how poorly he does, and basically what a looser he is. If this was one isolated incidents it would be one thing, but it just isn't. I've had this come up in meetings with my manager where he discussed the standing of someone and though didn't give an name, gave descriptors that made if fairly clear who he was talking about. I've also noticed that thought they do attempt to coach and help these people, they also treat them like they are total morons, talking just a bit more slowly, or explaining things just a bit more than necessary. This sometimes coming from manager who have only had this and one other job in the two or three years they've actually been old enough to work.... Manager I'm thinking of is 22. It's only his second job. No education past High School talking to an older man with a bachelors and 40 years work experience under his belt. Speaking of age, I have also noticed within our division, no one over a certain age gets promoted. There is a huge age gap in regards to who's moving up and who's not. This I find highly disturbing in that it appears to be clear age discrimination. Though the job is secure, they will not fire anyone for the most part. In all likelihood to avoid unemployment penalties. However they will keep people around bumping down their pay and putting them through Hell trying to push them out. On the surface it's a friendly upbeat environment. Under the surface though it's very very dysfunctional edging on abusive. One last thing to note..... the company is VERY conscious of it's image. They are big on ""Reputational Risk."" In working here you are told you are forbidden to act in any way politically, like any protests, volunteering with certain groups, etc. So be sure you are willing to trade your civil and constitutional rights fr a pay check. It's to the point that one person who wanted to volunteer with the opera of all things was told she had to get permission from a review board before she could even look at it.

Example: When setting the support rota for April, he waited until I went to lunch, sat down with everyone else on my team, and pulled out a calendar and deliberately scheduled me to be on call during Passover. (He himself never took call.) Another example: I was held at fault for ""arriving late"" every time there was a delay on the Metro-North commuter rail or the subway. Yet another example: There was a subway strike while I was at GS. All employees who had to take the subway were allowed to telecommute for the duration of the strike. My manager was not affected by the strike. He wrote me up for telecommuting because it was ""unnecessary"" -- for HIM. I did my best to deal with the situation, but it was untenable. I approached upper management, who told me to deal with it. I ultimately dealt with it by quitting for my own mental health and finding a job in Midtown Manhattan where they understood that delays on Metro-North were Metro-North's fault, not mine.

This place will always choose their investors first before their employees and only care about select divison of employe. They will cut cost by cutting head counts making impossible amount of work dreadfully more miserable. Tech development is not organic at all. Its just made nt bunch of real tech compan rejects who are looking for a buffer period to put Goldman Sachs on their resume and move on with unfinished or poorly developed product. Stress you get from this place is not even worth the negative health risk you become exposed to. However they do have on site physicians and psychiatrist who can help so that you can go back to the toxic work environment without having to leave the building. I never envisioned my 20s to spent missing so many birthdays and dinners. Also in regards to their marketing ""campaign of great place to work"" doesnt seem to be all that great at all when you have to deal with sting eyes of your managers for using your ""volenteer"" day or going to one of GStalk unless you are in tech. Operation and middle office space seem to take on lot more work in order to create bigger bonuses for the front office positions. Literally disgusting how we should feel thankful for less than a $10k bonus for analyst when your counterparts are drowning in bonuses multiples times greater.

1026,"""Global Investment Research (GIR) ART Program in Salt Lake City""",1.0,Working in Salt Lake City provides you with convenient access to skiing and other outdoor activities that would not be available if you were located in New York or San Francisco.,"The Analyst Research Training (ART) management in Salt Lake City will tell you nothing other than that you are the ""exact same as someone who is hired in New York"" or another core Global Investment Research (GIR) office to get you to sign the offer. After starting it will quickly become apparent that the goal of this program is to hire people into the program that are either from non-target schools or who were for one reason or another not a strong enough candidate to be considered for a position in New York and make them all compete for a few positions in New York after you have ""proven"" that you are capable of performing at a New York level. Your two years of experience will count as only one year of experience in New York (that means it will take you 4 years to become an Associate versus IBD where it take 2 years). You will be held to a higher standard than those that are hired into the New York analyst program as you need to ""prove yourself"" in order to be considered for a New York position. Management will state that the goal of the program is to pay analysts approximately 55% of what they pay them in New York since the cost of living is lower, however virtually all program participants will agree that part of the 45% discount is cost of living related and the other part is just the fact that you are considered a lower valued ""front office"" employee (on a cost of living adjusted basis you are just not getting paid what they do in New York). Even the argument of the discount being cost of living related is contradictory given that analysts that are hired in Houston (where the cost of living is even lower than SLC), get paid the same salary as an analyst in New York. As virtually all program participants are unhappy and regretful of the situation, you will constantly hear the Analyst Research Training (ART) program management in Salt Lake City and other levels of management say things like ""you just need to trust the system"", ""for you to perform at a New York level, I need you to do XYZ for me"", and ""we are going to have someone from New York speak with program members about making the transition from Salt Lake to New York"". Since it is generally accepted that the exit opportunities to the buy-side or corporate are more or less nonexistent from Salt Lake City (which from personal experience, this is more or less true), the goal of virtually all participants is to ""make it"" to New York. However, transferring to New York is discouraged after so many analyst have transferred to New York and immediately started recruiting for the buy-side. Since you are remote and your boss and team members don't have to see you face-to-face on a daily basis you will be treated as a second class citizen and anything you do or say will be automatically assumed incorrect or lacking merit because you were not good enough to be in New York. Doing anything to please the senior analyst and be a ""team player"" is expected, however this is only expected from the junior team members as management is perfectly fine with senior analysts treating junior team members like the second class citizens that they are. Senior analysts know that you have no other options, and that they can expect and demand anything from you regardless of how unreasonable it may be and the Analyst Research Training (ART) program management in Salt Lake City, will do nothing other than agree with them no matter how absurd and ridiculous it may be. There is no right and wrong, there is what a more senior person says and what a more junior person says and the senior person will always win. Probably the most challenging aspect of the program is that you are working on a daily basis with other program participants who are extremely jaded and distrusting of the firm. The vast majority of program participants will openly say to each other that they regret signing the offer because they feel they were deceived by the firm and management, and virtually everyone is doing anything and everything they can to leave the program, but most are not successful.",Goldman Sachs

A strong network greatly affects project outcomes - Policy allowing mobility at any time is a big benefit for productive and effective employees as it shifts bargaining power in their favor by forcing managers to keep the situation equitable or find someone else. - Lots of very brilliant people have worked and/or still remain there from a fairly diverse set of backgrounds. Literal rocket scientists and multi-PhD superstars all over the place - even as consultants.","- Strange culture where people often act like doing their job is a favor. Tricky communicating effectively with intelligent but often thin skinned and/or insecure personality types holding long term senior positions - Work often comes informally as high level projects along the lines of ""rethink and simplify the current expensive but proven solution with delivery of an entirely novel, unproven, theoretically more efficient paradigm"" - and then judged somewhat qualitatively on minor points and preferences, shaped by popular opinion. Politics here are as weird as they are dicey as they are crucial to getting ahead or staying afloat. - Compensation per employee is nothing like the press/media math of ""X profit / Y employees"". It's higher than average in general but there's many who are paid less than their value along with many medium term consultants with no skin in the game. On the positive side, there's almost no one who adds little to no value and sticks around for more than 3-6 months like all other banks - Management structure may be flat but largely because of its opaque, convoluted and constantly shifting nature. This can make it feel like a full political campaign cycle just to screw in a light bulb. - As crazy as it sounds, if you reach a senior level, it becomes difficult to pursue opportunities outside GS as the universe of companies that can and will provide both a better career trajectory and higher compensation shrinks dramatically.

There's always more to get done then there is time for. Sometimes projects aren't properly designed in order to meet the pressure of deadlines, and you end up building a Leaning Tower of Pisa. You usually have to perform support tasks (on that leaning tower) while simultaneously developing new features. After you've helped resolve issues, the same people come back and ask what the status is on the project delivery timeline… in a meeting you're spending time with them in, of course. Some in the business will ask why a bug existed and how we can stop them going forward, as though we knew about them to begin with and left them in. (Have they ever read the notes on any phone app update? Find one that didn't include bug fixes! Unfortunately, bugs happen. Please be understanding.) There's also a lot of proprietary in-house tech. Goldman often chooses to re-invent the wheel, instead of using an open source library, or contributing to them, for that matter.

Some management is very good and listens to their employees. If you want lots of new opportunity, it is yours, you just have to ask. If you want a career in the investment banking industry, this is the place. You just have to remember, just because the office is in SLC it doesn't mean less effort or time in the office. In fact, I would say it is more. Also, if you are having problems in your life, they will really help you out, but you have to ask them. If you are having personal issues, they will literally bend over backwards to help you. I knew a guy who got in a terrible accident while on vacation in Mexico and had to be life flighted to the US. Needless to say it was an expensive trip. GS took care of the whole thing. He didn't have to do anything. Also their maternity leave is KILLER. No one can touch it (4 months FULL Pay).","Terrible work life balance. I literally worked minimum 50 hours a week for almost 8 years (on slow weeks). And I was not even vice president (didn't want it, could not devote any more time). Also, there are some really awful managers that they keep around even though they violate company policies (favoritism). They really will just work you to death or a heart attack (or divorce) if you let them. It is all about face time (at least in my division). They would say it wasn't, but if you left ""early"" (less than 50 hours) people (and managers) would make comments, even if you were AWESOME and super efficient at your job. They didn't care.

Once recruiter said there are some companies out there who simply won't interview any ex-goldman employees as they are just behind in technological skills, and there is a 'bad' reputation for ex-gs people you do NOT make tons of money here unless you are the exceptional 1%. most people would LOVE to make the avg gs salary - 350K or 400K as advertised in wall st, but it's extremely top heavy. Go to other hedgefunds who could easily pay much more. GS is very savvy when it comes to saving/making money, and they won't spend more money to keep you happy- but just enough so you don't leave. The culture is all about facade--- it's very superficial and no one trusts anyone. because of this 360 degree 'review' system they have, everyone pretends to be nice to everyone but when it comes to review, they can always backstab you because only a few people can get the high marks. When I left, there was a backlog of exit interviews up to 3 months - and another colleague of mine who left 1 month after me said he had to wait 6 months for his exit interview. In other words, there is a mass exodus happening in technology. If you are in technology, you are considered a 'cost center' and will NOT be treated the same way biz side folks are treated (traders, sales, strats). What I see in GS is all these cost center people, Tech, Ops, Infra, end up trying to suck up to the business folks, empowering them to act rudely as they have the ultimate say in everything. Expect an extremely political environment. Either you get into the fraternity or you are out. Since 2008, there hasn't really been a 'golden year' where everyone was happy with their compensation. GS would use 3 factors to determine your comp - your performance, company performance, market benchmark ---- and they would also find that one factor to tell you why your comp is not gonna be stellar this year. If you are a technologist fresh out of college, I would totally recommend you to go into startup space and that way you would learn so much more. If you are a lateral hire from a tech industry, don't come to GS. If you are lateral hire from another finance industry, GS may be better than other big banks.. but if your objective is to maximize your salary, I would recommend a hedgefund space instead.",Goldman Sachs

I worked in the technology division of Goldman Sachs and i admire the smart people and technical courage of the company. The company truly believes in technology and is not afraid to build (and invest) in home grown products where all financial companies just live on the mercy of vendors and system integrator. You will be surprised at the scale and complexity of technical projects executed by Goldman on their own without the involvement of any vendor or service integrator. 2. They take great pride and ownership in their work. The company outsources very little and products receive great attention from everyone. Managers pay great attention to detail. Goldman definitely seeks perfection in what they do.,"1. Get used to executive worship culture. Goldman have MDs and Partners and they are living Gods in the corridors. This create a culture of sycophancy and executive pleasing. I have seen people spend their days and nights not on working but pleasing. 2. Very New York Centered. New York is the absolute power center and the managers there will share nothing with anyone else (even with other US cities). In other cities you don't have an authority to do anything without triple New York approval. All important projects are completely controlled out of NY and if you are in other locations you will find that its hard to grow. (or even breathe). 3. Its a company which encourages a culture where people work 20 hours a day. It's common to see colleagues work nonstop from 6:30 AM to Midnight. 4. Organizational Arrogance: Management has very firm views on what needs to be done and you have little or no voice. It takes many years of service for anyone to have a voice in the company. Questioning or disagreement almost always is a career limiting (or ending) move. This arrogance leads to a culture where people spend their entire culture building mega personas, and hyper images of themselves. Its a culture where snobbery thrive. 5. Very rigid organizational rules: Goldman follows lots of processes and governance models around IT. These models are so rigid that even small tasks can take many months of back and forth wrangling between IT and governance teams. This is why executing even small projects takes 10 times the effort it would take in a easy going organization.",Goldman Sachs

Benefits are very good. People are smart.,"In the technology division of Goldman, they have racked up tremendous technical debt. That debt needs to be repayed and the current work reflects that. Plan on spending a lot of time doing technical support and learning a lot of code that is not well-documented. Plan on fixing bugs and doing a lot of ""uplift"" work. If you are lucky, you may get to do some new development - but probably not for a few years. Goldman technology has had a lot of attrition the past 2 or 3 years - people getting fed up with the status quo. Management doesn't appear to be doing much about it. Their new strategy seems to be to drive their senior engineers out of the organization and replace them with younger, low-cost engineers that they can work to death and hold a work visa over their heads. Goldman hasn't had a really good year income-wise, since 2009. When you are interviewing, they will sell the ""bonus"" as a significant part of your total compensation. But, the bonus is directly related to the firms earnings for the year and less related to the great work you did that year. You could be a super hero engineer one year, but if the firm did badly that year, plan on a small bonus. On the other hand, you could have a less than stellar year with the firm performing well, and get a good bonus. My experience was that I got a good bonus a couple of years and a less-than-inspiring bonus on the other years. They talk a good talk about work-life balance, making you believe that is part of the corporate culture. Don't believe it. Once you get to the VP level and above, you will need to sell your soul to GS to continue to move up the corporate ladder. If you don't care about having a life outside of work and your family is a low priority, you will do very well at GS. Also be sure that you have very good skills playing ""corporate games"" and politics as you move up the ladder. Those skills become very important. If you are a good smoozer, you will do well. If not, plan on being treated badly enough that you will choose to leave on your own. Goldman rarely fires people. Their strategy is to level off your salary and stop paying you bonuses, until you leave on your own. It's a lot cleaner that way. No lawsuits to worry about for wrongful firing. GS is always looking to ""manage risk"", even when it comes to their people. Finally, the most important thing. Make sure you have a great relationshsip with your direct manager. GS does a ""360 degree review"", but 350 of those degrees are the opinion of your direct manager. Even if 15 of your peers think you are a superstar, you will not got a good ranking, if your direct manager thinks you are lacking. By the way, a poor ranking against your peers translates into getting passed over for a bonus. Summary - Join GS right out of college, work 4 or 5 years, get trained, get some experience, get GS on your resume and get out. A smart strategy for the smart engineer.",Goldman Sachs

2259,"""The price of success""",1.0,"So what's it like working for Goldman Sachs? Well, first things first, I worked in one department of one of the many divisions of GS. GS is a company of well over 30,000 employees. Each division is like a company in and of itself, so generalising an experience even within a single division is fraught with issues, so you'll have to take my words in that very narrow context. The Good Probably the best thing about this company is that it is very pro-diversity. They want to create a work environment that mirrors the real world on the outside and they are keen to tap the brain power of the diversity that's out there. While I don't particularly care to know at work what someone gets up to in their own downtime, it's likely to be reassuring to others who are LGBT or of other diverse backgrounds who are looking to their own futures within the firm. To reinforce the firm commitment, it is mandatory for employees to complete a minimum of 2 hours annual diversity training. I'd say that every person I met at GS was top notch. There are no village idiots or jokers lurking anywhere. Professionalism is at the core of being a successful employee. I always got the feeling I was rubbing shoulders with the 'A' grade crowd...the Ivy Leaguers. Almost everyone is uber smart and hyper keen. If you have an issue and you need someones help, then most people (though not all) you talk to will make it their mission to help you out. The corporate gym is very well equipped. Great machines, great classes to attend and cheap membership gives you an Rebok-like experience at about half the price. It's a bit weird the first few times you go as GS optionally lends you a gray t-shirt, gray shorts and white socks to sweat you stuff in so no need for you to bring in your smelly sweats to the office (but you will need your own training shoes as thankfully they are not provided). Membership includes your own private locker but I never used mine as I'd never want to leave anything sweaty in a locker overnight! Since everyone uses GS sweats, this culminates in a complete lack of gym clothing diversity...it's a sea of gray and you feel like platoon infantryman as you wander round the gym floor.","The Bad Work-life balance. Depending on the division you work in will have a great bearing on how hard you will be expected to work. Miraculously the department of the division I was in is somewhat chilled out compared to all other parts of the firm I heard about. Most of my colleagues were averaging about 45 hours per week. That's almost unheard of in GS most colleagues in different divisions were putting down 16 hour days every day as a norm. When you exit the building at 6.30pm of an evening on your way home, you will pass a swarm of busy bees carrying bags of takeaway food re-entering the building on their way back to their desks for another 4 or 5 hours of work. These are the eager beavers and the company rewards this kind of hard work when bonus season comes round in February. If you're not one of these people, then chances are your career is unlikely to reach the stars to say the least. A 55 hour week is at the very bottom end of the “hard work” spectrum. Read the Forbes article about Liz Beshel to see what the commitment level for success really is at GS if you plan to go beyond the stratosphere at GS. The Ugly Almost every big corporate company shares the same ""hard work"" traits, but GS effortlessly manages to up the ante to another level: 1) You are always available even when you're on vacation because of the Blackberry phone You are always just a phone call or an email away from being brought into help solve the latest problem no matter what hour of the day is or what plans you made with your family this weekend. Logging in from home in the weekday evenings and on weekends like everyone else does is a basic norm at GS Not responding to a weekend crisis due to a trip away with the family is something to avoid. The company expects performers to be available at all times 2) When you join the firm you will spend one day going through 'orientation', effectively being indoctrinated in all things GS. During this day, you will learn (among other things) about the strength of the GS 'posting culture'. They tell you that everyone posts constantly and it is expected that you will post constantly as well. Due to the ""posting"" culture at GS, your inbox will quickly overflow every single workday so mastery of Outlook will go some way towards managing it, but in reality, most folk put in additional evening work hours to get on top of it all. The signal to noise ratio is generally appalling from middle management upwards. 3) As if email traffic wasn't a bad enough problem to manage, they have recently added 2 more mountains for the GS information worker to scale, neither of which are inter-connected. i. First up, GSConnect is the internal social network – think Facebook meets LinkedIn meets Goldman Sachs (It's built on top of the popular Jive social platform). This is a reputation (points) based platform for everyone to hear about what everyone else is up to in the firm and chime in with comments, articles, advice and tips. For many folk at GS, this is a great means for marketing ones own skills within the firm. Being seen to continually contribute to the team and the firm will get you noticed. But like any social platform it is a double edged sword that could easily destroy ones reputation in a heartbeat. Not being seen to actively contribute will come back to haunt the employee at review time and therefore at bonus time. ii. Second up, LiveCurrent is the new instant chat program that you will need to be seen participating in. This is a place to share information in a more immediate manner with the GS hive. It's nothing more than chat rooms. LiveCurrent is a basic annoyance as pop up toast interrupts the working day continuously with banal updates from various leaders 4) GS meetings are primarily all about asking questions. If you want to succeed at GS, you need to practice this art to perfection. Unfortunately most meetings are a waste of time but there is no throttle to control them other than to decline them, but not seen to be participating will come at a price during the annual review process. Most meetings result in more noise be it email trail, GSConnect or LiveCurrent - trying to stay on top of the noise is challenging to say the least. 5) Consensus driven culture. The orientation day will inform you that there is no such thing as a 'star' performer at GS because everyone operates in a team and therefore the team is the 'star'. Not only that, but you will now have to get used to “building consensus” on a very regular basis. You will get praise for being seen to round up the herd and get buy in from everyone for decisions of any magnitude and that is the problem. Typically (outside of GS), most people naturally seek consensus when there are big decisions, but GS has promoted consensus building to a first class citizen within the firm so even small decisions get quickly bogged down with the basic requirement to build consensus. 6) The 360 degree annual review. This is a 2 month gruelling process imposed on everyone at GS that is taken very seriously by all. It is essential to have mended all fences with your colleagues at least 2 months before the review process starts or suffer the the wrath of their short term memory. The official word from management is that the review process does not affect your bonus which is very hard to believe. 7) Unofficially, GS has currently different levels that are **due to be disbanded**. The levels are as follows: Analyst, L1, L2, L3, M1, M2, Partner. If you are being hired currently, be sure to ask the level you are being hired in at because they won't tell you unless you ask and it will take you a month or so after being hired before you find out and this information and by then it will be too late to change it (you will have to wait for the annual promotions for which you have to be nominated first). To give you an idea, L2 is someone with 5 years experience. Levels are not advertised internally at all, so you will have no idea what level other people are at unless you have the conversation. Being hired in at the right level will influence the compensation bracket you fall into, so it's reasonably critical to know - you want to come in at a level that truly reflects your skills and abilities. A key point to make here is that the levels are due to be disbanded very soon (or it may already have taken place since I am an ex-employee). It's worth mentioning that VP (Vice President) is merely a badge of honor at GS, not a level as just discussed. Therefore, it is of no consequence to your compensation, so bartering for VP with HR is nowhere near as important as bartering for level since only the latter will have any impact on your compensation profile. So now you know. 8) With no one knowing what level anyone else is at, you won't be surprised to hear that GS has no org-chart. So you will have no idea who reports in to who. This can be very confusing and the idea is to reduce structure in a bid to allow ideas to easily bubble up. If you are used to a classical hierarchy where you report into one boss who defines what is required of you then beware as it doesn't work like that at GS. When you add up the time spent processing the ever flowing fountain of information you will soon notice that you have no time to do the job you were actually hired for unless you plan on working evenings because only then can you actually get some work done once the crescendo of information dies down for a few precious hours. Stealing your way into work by 7.30am will also buy useful time before the noise starts up again. With the banking sector having effectively destroyed itself from its own deregulated excesses of the 2000 era, it's worth noting that remuneration packages were substantially reduced as a result. It's fair to say that most employees will not climb any higher than middle management (L2 is the defacto level at GS) and it's only after middle management that game changing compensation starts to kick in. Assuming you were to get to that point, consider carefully the time that will need to be sacrificed in your life (especially family life) and weigh up the pros and cons. If you get an offer from GS then that itself tells you something useful: you are by definition a high calibre individual since very few candidates get an offer from GS. With that in mind, why not consider channeling your highly rated skill-set (and GS are excellent at gauging skill-sets) into joining a fun start-up (GS is not a fun place to work by the way)? Or if you have a ground breaking idea, why not do you own startup?",Goldman Sachs

If you are a new joiners or just out of college, chances are you're going to get paid just a bit more than OK, but not great. Mostly in the form of a bonus.

The monetary rewards can be amazing, but were not worth giving up my personal life and personal time, in my own opinion. Ideas for change are welcomed, but a very corporate culture can make it difficult to get things accomplished and changed. Managers can be very forgetful and have to be reminded of things everything. When they forget something, they blame you for not remembering for them. Credit to the individual is thrown out the window as everything is focused on how the team does, however coworkers will take credit for your work with your direct manager if you don't raise your hand say you did X task. Analyst pay is very low which quickly hurts morale. Compensation has taken a hit in the recent years, although the executives in New York have gotten compensation increases. Operations is heavily dependent on I.T., however the communication is very difficult and I.T. is so backed up, it can take months before they get to a request of yours. Perks have been reduced to the point where ""Jeans Day"" is the highlight of the quarter. The office is not client facing therefore business casual clothes is not always required. Let all Fridays be jeans day. Christmas, Halloween, etc, have all been cancelled at the office. Anyone who decorates their area that is festive with the season will get a stern talking to by the closest Managing Director. Its like they suck the little bit of fun you would think you're allowed to have out of the work place. One can take sick days as needed, however if you miss more than 1 day and you're not dying or in the hospital, your work starts to get distributed to other team members. This creates a stigma that you're not that sick and can still work from home.

2391,"""GS Operations is a great place to start If you want to be in finance or you don't have a plan out of college""",3.0,"A little background about myself, I worked in the Salt Lake City Office which has grown to be the second biggest location in the United States and my entire career was in Operations Division. Please take that into account. I can't speak for Sales, Trading, or any other division outside of having to deal with them on a regular basis to get work done nor can I talk about the other office locations outside having visited a few and all are different. Ops is great in that you can learn a lot of transferable skill sets and abilities that you can take to almost any job. You are only niched into ops by your own lack of creativity if you think that ops is a dead end career choice post college. I hope this helps puts things in perspective for a lot of you. I still believe that overall this is a great place to start a career although I would doubt that its a place where people ultimately make their careers (at least in Ops). Some Pros about GS is that - Professional growth If you don't know what you want to do in life running through the gauntlet that is Goldman Sachs is a smart move to build up your professional profile and skill set. You will be forced into situations that take you out of your comfort zone and if you are lucky you will have some good people around you to help you prepare and learn from those experiences. Every situation is treated with highest professional manner and everything you do is expected to be of the highest quality of work. Every report should be accurate and concise, every email professional in tone and content, every analysis has every angle covered with good presentation and the appropriate content for the audience. Everything matters and you better be sure your work is up to grade. Don't be scared they will understand you are new to this the first few times you make a mistake. - Smart people all around you If you haven't realized it by now you will shortly that you are rarely the smartest person in the room (if you are currently that will change at GS). These people are smart. Very smart. You can pull the wool over their eyes once or twice or maybe get by for awhile with a manager that doesn't care but in the long run (year or longer) you will be exposed. Thats ok, you don't always have to be the smartest in the room you just can't take it personal every time someone calls you out in public or private and get better. Again, this is Ops not other divisions. Ops is not out to call you out every time you make a mistake or criticize you on every idea. They do it its because the firm benefits more when your mediocre idea is vetted with other smart people and becomes a great proposal. Don't take it personal. - High stress environment This is a pro and a con. If you can handle a high stress environment you will thrive. If you can't you will learn to or you will be looking for a new job shortly after joining. GS puts a lot of pressure on you really quick. Like I said before, what you do matters and sometimes you have to make really hard decisions in short periods of time because market is closing or client is threatening a walk or your manager doesn't want to lose his or her head and needs you to crunch some numbers yesterday. Just know that once you overcome these obstacles you will be better for it. - Responsibility is high for junior individuals Another pro and con. Almost the same speech from high stress environment. - Mentors Rest assured the really good managers at GS (and they exist) understand that good junior analysts need good mentors to show them the ropes and take them under their wing. GS will even match you up with one if you haven't found one on your own. Just know that its on you to follow up with them and if you are smart you will have more than one and they will be strategically placed in positions that you can leverage. Reach out to them, gain their insight and heed their advice because they have been there longer than you and guess what they are still there and successful so they must know what they are talking about. Just don't restrict yourself to one, get many and get them from backgrounds that you are not comfortable with. More perspectives will often change your own on a situation. Take this advice; man walks in a desert when he surrounds himself with people that think and act like him.","- Work/Life balance Forget it, you won't have one. You work 10 hour days on a good day and 15+ on a bad day. Your dog will drown in anxiety or chew up your sneaker collection, your wife will hate your job, your kids will wonder if you love them and your friends will inevitably people that work with you or in the same industry. Assuming of course you are on the path to success at the firm. Otherwise you may be able to pull off weekend getaways, the occasional afterwork drink and hey maybe even the gym to burn off all those donuts you ate your desk. - High stress environment Read above but if you can't handle being in a stressful, high strung, alpha environment where everything you do matters than please save yourself the therapy sessions and medical costs and try something else. - The actual work can be boring Yeah it sucks, especially at the analyst level. Guess what? Processing transactions, data entry, project testing, trade settlement, account opening, etc all suck. They are not fun. Not even a little. But it gets better... you know when you are an Associate and you are leading a team of analysts doing something they hate for that almighty dollar. - Corporate politics This is not unique to GS. For those that are in college are have never worked at a large organization please mentally prepare yourself for the office politics. They are there and you are playing whether you like it or not. You can choose not to play and hope by the good graces of Allah and Blankfein that you are noticed for your good work but I have a higher chance of getting that 10 at the gym to ask me out on date. You are going to have to play. Marathon some Suits on USA and learn up on office politics and keep yourself out of the crosshairs as much as you can. Build friendships and network, don't through people under the bus, and don't take credit for someone else's work and you will be fine. This is where a mentor will do you well. - Compensation Analyst level it sucks and you will kick yourself for it. Stick it out and get lucky that the firm has a great year and you too can have a great year. Just remember its based on how well the firm did, how well your business unit did, and how well you did. Oh and you are also in ops which is at the end of the day a cost and not a revenue generating arm of the firm and so you will never get rich until you make MD. Well off at VP but not rich. - Senior Leadership How can I say this. Just because Michael Jordan was arguably the best player ever... doesn't mean he is a great coach. Phil Jackson was a mediocre player and well look what he accomplished. GS traditionally promotes Jordan's to management so prepare yourself. - Accountability You should definitely have this. Some people won't and some people will. Sadly you will find there are large groups in GS Ops that are not. You can't change them and unfortunately those that don't are what slows down good businesses. Be accountable and you will be surprised on how fortunate that will be for you. Heck, be accountable for other people, it shows leadership and managers will recognize that. - Can't trade (oddly a big downer) GS Ops cannot trade on personal accounts. Well you can but only if you first check with your manager, the compliance lists and your mom. Sadly almost every company is on some list that restricts you from trading. Get used to indexes and big funds. Its like working for Sam Adams and company policy says you cant drink... ever without asking them first. - Grindhouse mentality for some areas There are areas of GS Ops that are quite literally grindhouses. They take you in, chew you up, and then spit you out when you are done. Then they go out and get the next college kid and repeat. Sorry its just how it is. Learn what you can and transfer to another area if you want or leave but its their business model and it works for management.",Goldman Sachs
