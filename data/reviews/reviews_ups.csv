I was told if I did an excellent job, it might be possible; no details or goals were provided to determine what was considered a ""good job."" So, I drove more miles, delivered more packages, received more customer compliments, never took a day off, and worked more hours than any other Peak Season PVD. One day I covered four routes and worked more than fifteen hours; I was told to clock out before hitting fourteen hours to avoid UPS getting a DOT violation and add the remaining hours to my timecard the next day. When 2019 Peak Season ended, I repeatedly asked if I would be considered for full-time employment and finally was told I was the top performer. Still, other perimeters out of my control prevented management from choosing me. I later discovered those perimeters were minority-related, and nothing to do with performance. I wish UPS management had been forthcoming at the beginning regarding diversity needs. I would have still joined the UPS team for the 2019 season, but I won't have gotten my hopes up, and I likely wouldn't have risked my safety working late into the night driving on roads in rural locations, often without cell service. Or missing essential time with my family during the holidays. Ironically, I was asked to cover routes in rural areas because another Peak season PVD of color had a gun pulled on him, and they felt it safer for a person not of color. I tried to reach out to UPS Human Resources about this and several other things; they make it impossible to talk to anyone. They don't provide a number or email address for employees to contact them; you must go through local UPS management if you have issues, including sexual harassment.

See below for more if you are really thinking of working here: -The bosses refer to you as ""bodies"", they truly don't care about any of the temp people or their full time employees.

711,"""Seasonal Driver Helper""",1.0,"The job is generally very fun. Golf cart drivers get to ride around in a golf cart every day. I personally also enjoy logistics, so it's right up my alley. If you like hard work, you'll enjoy a good 75% of this job. The flip side is obviously also true and it gets worse.","Disorganized. No one knows what the hell they're doing. None of my supervisors even knew how to use the device they sent me properly. Time changes were constant. No one knew where I needed to be or when. Package drops were constantly late. They would tell us to be at the checkpoint at 7am but wouldn't release drivers from the hub until 9. Low Pay. Few Hours. I got paid garbage. I would finish my cart route in a couple of hours each day and I usually had to hound my managers for extra shifts. Seasonal workers don't make any money. You stick out the seasonal work and give it your absolute all to try to get a full time gig where you'll be well compensated and given benefits for getting crapped on constantly. Though the teamsters just recently rolled over on a contract that the drivers rejected so they're trying to lower benefits now too. Poor work environment. They don't care about their employees any more than the union contract requires. High stress, low reward. Ineffectual and uninformed management. They are slaves to the system. They begged me to work for them full time after the season ended. I've gotten 3 or 4 calls since last season ended asking me when my start date is. Their system wouldn't allow me to submit an application because when I applied for full time before I took the seasonal gig, I was rejected, and if you get rejected, the system puts a hold on your profile. But management doesn't know or understand that so they just string you along. The right hand doesn't talk to the left. My advice is, don't apply for a full-time/part-time job first. Just wait til september/october and apply for seasonal. Work your actual butt off and go from there. But I make no guarantees. HR doesn't know how the system works. They don't seem to even know that there's a system. They will call you when they need you, but if you call them, they don't answer, they won't return your call, they won't respond to voicemails. The ineptitude of their HR department is like borderline illegal. Also, rain. You will get soaked. It will be cold. The carts have no windshield, which can be tough even on a dry day, but when it rains, each drop hits your face like a little bullet. Also, you have to throw a tarp over your packages to keep them dry so you spend even more time standing in the rain. There is no jacket, poncho, waterproof layering, that will help that even a little bit. I even bought water resistant boots for this job and they might have made things worse. If a puddle was ankle high and I couldn't get around it, the water just goes went right over the edge and pooled inside the boots. You need to embrace the water. Pretend it can't hurt you, that it has no power over you. Pretend that you want to get soaked. If you fight it, it will break you. My best rain days were the days I dressed the lightest. I wore athletic shorts and a sweat wicking shirt and beat my chest and dared the rain to get me. I'd still get soaked but my attitude was better. I wouldn't go home feeling like a wreck. You have to wear boots so get some that are light and don't worry about waterproof. Better something that will dry quickly that try and fail to keep you dry in the first place.",UPS

ALSO, very few “potty breaks” because of both unavailability and “the need for speed.” Helper generally does more package-running than driver does—or at least that was my experience. Because position’s window of opportunity was relatively small I worked w/a sprained ankle I injured early in my 2nd week on the job. Packages are DIRTY!

Sometimes you'll get nothing but the heavier volume which quickly wears you out. - Management expectations don't line up with UPS safety procedures.

Frustrating, especially when managers come in and tell you how to appropriately load (which slows you down when you are already behind) - Managers and Supervisors constantly move you between trailers to catch up on volume (even when the trailer you're currently working in is already behind), very frustrating. - Volume being all over the floor and potentially trapping you inside the trailer seems to be quite normal, and most people don't help you at that point unless a supervisor orders them to, also very frustrating. - They send people home early when it feels like we have the right amount of people for the volume for that night, making the work overwhelming for those who stayed to work. - [Arguably a con] Job description describes that you generally work between 3.5-4 hours, but in my experience I generally worked 4-5.5 hours - Break is generally 1-1.5 hours into the shift for about 10-15 minutes, then you work the rest of the night.

Don't get me started on equipment, assuming you can even get any, I can't even get my hands on a radio each day.

If you work hard and do a good job you’ll shine but the management roles that open are minimal especially in Richmond, VA (at Freight). Most jobs I would see open up are in ATL, GA so it’s great for people willing to relocate. I’m going to give a 3 out of 5 rating - I truly loved all of the people I worked with and all of my managers, but there’s definitely room for improvement from a previous employee standpoint looking at the company overall (see below).","In the 5 years I worked there I saw several structural changes and layoffs. The workload as a Pricing Analyst is intense and the demands of the Sales team will keep you more than busy. I feel there is pretty good job security in the Revenue Management dept. but transformation can occur at anytime. The vacation time isn’t ideal for folks with kids (2 weeks until you’ve reached 8 years of employment - on the freight side, small package is a little better), the lack of time off almost encourages folks to just “call in sick” when you’ve used up your vacation time. For those who are honest with a work ethic don’t do that, unfortunately I saw abusers of calling in. Here is a solution: create a PTO bucket with increased time off combined with vacation and sick time, once it’s used up people have to take leave with no pay. It makes people choose their time a little bit more wisely. Those who don’t call in sick have the leisure of a better work/life balance and can actually use more time for vacation and with family, and those who abuse can call in without pay once they’ve used their time. I left the company getting more pay with less work, and double the time off (4 weeks!). Unfortunately it seems like there’s just more out there than what Freight was willing to offer.",UPS

I was lucky enough to get along with my driver. Sometimes he’d buy me lunch or bring water for me. No strict dress code, just wear the reflective vest they give you. The people you deliver to are honestly really nice, most are happy to see you because they’re receiving their package. That was a really nice feeling. I delivered to the same neighborhood every day and it was nice to become acquainted with the locals. Some apartment complexes offer free drinks and sometimes people leave snacks at their door steps for us. There’s always room for overtime too. We get holidays off. Unpaid.

They claimed it was from November 1st to January 15 but it was a lot shorter than that. I didn’t get a set route until the middle of November and they laid me off the 22nd of December with little to short notice. Apparently it wasn’t as busy this year. Communication from the help center is terrible. So much confusion at the beginning when they start giving out routes. It’s almost impossible to contact them unless they call you. Helpers don’t get holiday pay. It’s the end of the year so drivers are using their remaining sick pay. Those factors hurt my hours the most. Sometimes drivers will be asked to make you go home early. The only rude people I dealt with were some drivers that I worked with and apartment staff working in the leasing office. They’re very stuck up for some reason. The hardest places to deliver are apartment complexes hands down. Too many stairs and too many packages to carry on your cart. And sometimes it’s hard to find your way around.

1893,"""My Experience as a Seasonal Preloader""",3.0,"Some of the managers were great at their job in training you. Some of the Co-workers were also motivated enough to assist you as a newcomer. Pre-loading position offers an early enough work schedule that allows for you to be done with the hardest work of your day early in the morning. It's great hours for early risers, and allows you to be able to work on other important projects during daylight hours if you need to. For those who appreciate keeping physically active while they work - this may be the job for you. You can get well over 10,000 steps in within a 5+ hour work shift. Remember to not strain yourself with lifting boxes that are too heavy without asking for assistance. Follow UPS attire guidelines; especially as it relates to the shoes, as best you can because this will protect YOUR feet in the event you lift a heavy box that has not been taped sufficiently and the bottom opens up and contents fall out! Free health insurance if you get hired on as a regular employee (after 9 months!)","If you are not lucky enough to get hired during a time or location that has helpful co-workers or managers, you will not be trained sufficiently, which will leave the drivers of the trucks you load frustrated for the rest of their day. During the UPS rush season - most of the managers are too frustrated or distracted to provide sufficient training to newcomers. They also sometimes assume that those they hire that have worked for other companies such as Fedex will know how to do the job - which is not true. Most importantly; UPS seems to not care much about making sure they calculate your hours correctly. You had best to keep track of your schedule and check behind whomever enters your work hours if you want to be sure that you are getting paid for all hours and minutes worked. When the holiday rush was over, they called us in for a couple days then literally laid us off prematurely and abruptly without any advance notice; (they told us at end of January we would be done.) This showed a great lack of concern for employees that helped them out during their busiest season of the year and have bills to pay. We seasonals were hired on with incorrect information about how much our hourly wage would be. It was much less. Hiring managers were helpless it seemed; as the change was tied up in union and corporate red tape. The FREE insurance will not kick in until you have become a full-time or regular employee for nine months; that does not include the months that you worked as a seasonal worker! The company is reportedly dealing with corporate instructions to cut back on their expenses - so they send some workers home early when they are done with what they usually do- instead of sending them to help with the overload of work that other employees have on their hands. They also did not hire on some of us that were proven hard workers with great work ethics. We were told corporate may not be hiring on regulars as much as in the past or at all.

Definitely a great job for people who don't mind hard work and are looking to attend college or to move up the ladder. Also has lots of diversity, which is cool.","Not a lot of full-time positions currently in my facility, so the jobs aren't very sustaining money wise. Pretty much everyone I've worked with is working at ups to supplement their main income. I'm not sure why but there's no shift differential for night workers, which I thought was odd. The company is ultimately corporate, so the bottom line and the saving of money is, of course, very obvious. The immediate supervisors suffer most for it, sometimes running around in a frenzy because upper management thinks the workers should be done within a specific and sometimes unreasonable time frame.

1928,"""Honest Review""",4.0,"- Great training and great learning opportunity - Good benefits, decent wages -Weekly pay - Opportunity for promotion* - Work/life balance The training program at UPS is world class. The company invests a ton of money into the training (your benefits start pretty much immediately, you're paid well during training, 4-7 weeks of actual training depending on the flavor at the time). The Sales Academy is mostly a classroom setting, and the much of the training is highly applicable to sales in general (i.e. Situational Sales Negotiations, CRM technology, etc). This is a great place to grow your business acumen very quickly. The health insurance is fantastic and the base pay is decent (see below for comments on commission). At the specialist level, you are paid weekly, which is nice. Think of this as a sales job with training wheels. If you're new to sales or the corporate environment, it's really hard to get fired due to lack of performance. If you ask for help, you will usually get help. Right now, there is a lot of room for advancement. It's probably not going to be in less than a year (like I was told), but after 1-2+ years there is room for advancement. Depending on the team you are put on (which is totally luck of the draw) there is great mentorship available. I have personally been able to develop my own leadership and public speaking skills because my coach has made it a point to find out how I want to develop as a professional. I am directly surrounded by strong leaders that give me the room and guidance for growth. SO MUCH of your experience at UPS has to do with your manager. Finally, there is a lot of stability in UPS. It is an S &amp; P 100 company that has been around for over 110 years and in a world where B2C commerce is expected to grow 50% by 2020, you can feel confident that UPS is going to continue to be solid for the foreseeable future.","- Misleading on commission and PTO in the job offer - Difficult commission structure - Constantly moving target goals - The environment feels like a call center - Stagnant corporate culture - That other person wasn't joking, you really do sit in a cubicle and get fat I was made a lot of promises that weren't completely true when offering me the job. I was told I would have the opportunity to be promoted within 3-6 months of starting the job, which was not even remotely accurate. I was also told there were two weeks of paid vacation in the first year, but vacation time is actually pro-rated after your 6-month probationary period. Finally, I was told my target commission would be $12k - $15k per year, which is wildly inaccurate. This is a good opportunity, but it's not everything they promise it will be. This is my biggest issue with UPS - I feel it is at best unethical and at worst potentially illegal to be so misleading in a job offer. Don't let HR fool you into thinking they are hiring because there is so much promotion. There is high turnover for many reasons: culture, feeling underappreciated, higher paying equivalent positions elsewhere). The commission pay structure changes every year making it difficult to understand and achieve. As I write this I know that my SIP (commission) will change in January, so the next sentence may not even be true in a month. The commission is currently based off of the performance of your territory compared to last year. This structure means that you have to reel in a whale to affect your pay. Additionally, commission is only paid out quarterly. The environment can be very high-stress. There are high expectations and the target is constantly moving, making it difficult to achieve. ***Management gets commission based on your performance and management gets a $$$ bonus when you are promoted within business development***. Because of this, management is very resistant to people entering into other divisions (such as operations or finance). The culture in Inside Sales is beyond out-dated. From the dress code to the way people interact, a lot of policies would be better suited at a sock hop than a modern place of business. Finally: this is corporate America. There is a hierarchy. Sometimes your boss yells at you simply because they got yelled at. A lot of initiatives don't make sense. A lot of things, in general, don't make sense. You are 1 out of 450,000 employees. Being mediocre and doing things their way is the key to success. Overall, this is a decent job, especially for new graduates. I would not suggest staying in this position long-term, but I personally feel that I have learned a lot. UPS is a solid company and there is room for growth. Modulate your expectations, learn how to speak corporate UPSese and move on to bigger and better things.",UPS
