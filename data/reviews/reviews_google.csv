1,Google,"1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us. Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am. It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change. 2) Poor management. I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence. Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult."" People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into. So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders. Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously. 3) Jerks. Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same). Years ago, that wasn't the case. I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience. I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance. 4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy. So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing. Google says, ""Don't be evil."" But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices. :(","1) Food, food, food. 15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone. Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day. 2) Benefits/perks. Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus). Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available. Bowling alley. Volley ball pit. Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV). Free health/fitness assessments. Dog-friendly. Etc. etc. etc. 3) Compensation. In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive. 4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse). 5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically). In practice, not true. 6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry. There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).",4.0,"""Moving at the speed of light, burn out is inevitable"""
2,Google,"* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension). * The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse. * Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.","* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused). * The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially. * Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants. * There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody. * It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are). * The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive. * No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible. Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement. * Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand. * If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.",5.0,"""Great balance between big-company security and fun, fast-moving projects"""
3,Google,"I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal. Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things. You'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning. No one has time to train you or teach you what you're doing - which is kind of hard. After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you're not one of them, you'll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear. It's a big company now. And super political. So don't be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don't let people see your vulnerableness. It's a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30-something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing - they're not. They're driven. If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in. When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important - they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you. Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc. It's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge. I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out.","You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets. You'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world You'll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management. You'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing You'll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you'll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable. There are 22 cafes (more or less), the food is excellent, and it's free. Your pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved. Google cares about how it treats its employees. The campus is like an academic campus in many ways. There are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out - but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things. You'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google. If and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors. The company is flexible - if you're lucky, you won't have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work - but don't get me wrong - you'll work a LOT. But you don't have to do all of it chained to your desk.",5.0,"""The best place I've worked and also the most demanding."""

Your experience can be really pendant on the manager and the function you're in. Managers are not as intentionally selected, well-trained, or well-incentivized as they should be. Not all managers are trained diligently enough to operate with a true servant leadership style, and it's palpable, and can be detrimental to the growth and development of employees underneath them. This is something Google is actively working to redesign, but a behemoth of an organization takes many cycles of evolution to move the needle. Prepare to constantly exist amidst re-orgs and change. The organization is so large, that the work is segmented into singular functions, and the result is that you feel this urgent need to pile project work onto your plate to prove your worth and get promotion-ready. Career opportunities are there, but internal mobility is a true black box. Feels slow-moving, inaccessible, and not very transparent.

If it isn’t a Google product or technology, no one has heard of it or has any interest in it - Very consensus-driven decision-making, to the point at which groupthink is almost ubiquitous - This means that lots of smart people with limited information make lots of poor decisions when they get together as a group - the hype about data-driven decisions at google is b-s - Also worthy of note, your experience outside of Google, regardless of what you have accomplished, will be ignored or forgotten after you start. You are just another number among 100,000 others. - You will come across people who have worked at the company for 10 years or more and have completely lost touch with the outside world, yet are somehow put in charge of building products for those users in the outside world! - many longtime employees, including fairly senior folks, have only really shipped 1-2 products before because Google is so slow — and are much less experienced than they would otherwise appear - In short, if you have more than 8-10 years of work experience at other tech companies, don’t work here. You will work for people who are much less experienced than you and it will set your career back","- extremely nice and helpful people, great perks. - Generally take software engineering extremely seriously. - Hiring standards for young engineers are outstanding.

The number of poor decisions made by leadership will make you question whether Google knows what it’s doing anymore.

I’ve known very few people who are happy at Google - and if they are, it’s because they have golden handcuffs and are fine with it. The worst culprit at Google is the obsession with “perf” (performance reviews) and the promo cycles. As someone who’s worked at multiple companies in the bay, I’ve never seen such an intense obsession with an artificial ranking system. It’s turned into a game that people play on the daily and are desperate to win by artificially inflating their work and pushing people out of the way to get what they want.

316,Google,"The downside of having all of this, is that you attract the worlds best colleagues. Seemingly you would think this is a good thing, and while to a degree it is (pretty much everyone I work with is outright brilliant), the repercussions of this are far greater than you would initially assume. Imagine the most type A, overachieving folks in your old college classes. You know, the ones that will literally go way above and beyond to do a truly exceptional job (chances are if you work at Google you were one of those folks). Now imagine only the top 1% of all of those people are in one place at the same time. Now think about what happens to the culture when you put all of those folks together and keep hiring them as your company scales. Suddenly everyone is taking on the max possible amount of work and doing the equivalent of 3 people's workload, and then that becomes the norm for everyone. And no one will ever complain about it because at the end of the day everyone wants to be a team player and never say no to a request, regardless of the time commitment. This leads to everyone working long hours, working on vacations, and even while sick. To make matters worse, your manager is probably the same way. Since Google will hire a director from another company and make them a manager at Google (because Google is so big a director's scope of work will be similar to that of a manager at Google), chances are your direct manager has the ambition of a top preforming senior leader. And while they are likely to be very nice (for example my current manager is absolutely amazing) , they will set your workload based on your peer's workload since the average assumption is that if the others on the team can do it, why can't you? Put this all together and you quickly have folks burning out left and right, and consequentially a very low average tenure for your team despite people loving their core jobs. It quite sad really because everyone I know in my Org is very happy outside of the amount of burnout they feel. Another important note is that it takes forever to get promoted at Google because regardless of how good the quality of your work is, you have to compete against colleagues who generally speaking are willing to do whatever it takes, and make any life compromise necessary to get promoted. Overall, I think Google is a well intended company, with well intended employees that sadly have fell victim to losing their own culture through scaling and hiring the best.","Google is a truly exceptional company to work for in so many regards.

But once you reach the higher levels, you'll realize that the company has become a cloying, insular, and claustrophobic place. Internal technology falls further behind the outside world every day, but people still speak and act like they did when Google was years ahead of everyone else. It's an environment of total hubris. God help you if you try to rock the boat. If you do, people snipe at you in design documents, slander your work and your mannerisms behind your back, and undermine you in performance reviews, all the while presenting just enough of a friendly facade to maintain plausible deniability. Nobody will tell you what's really going on. Very few people are interested in technical excellence. The joke is that Google hires the smartest people to ""move protos"" (i.e., do drudge work) all day. It took me years to realize that the ""move protos"" meme resonates because the L7-L9 old-time clique comes down like a fist on anyone trying to do more than make uncreative, incremental, and low-impact changes. Maybe you don't care about technical excellence. If you don't, you won't be alone: ""merit"" and ""heroism"" are dirty words at Google. Maybe you want to work your 10-4 job, land a few CLs, eat your free lunch, get your middling performance scores, and collect your above-average paycheck, all the while crusading on memegen or whining about how unfair it is that the company evaluates your performance twice per year. If that's what you want to do, Google is the place for you. But if you're the kind of person who wants to advance technology, to apply your intellect to hard problems, and to bring something new into the world, then (unless you get extraordinarily lucky with team placement) Google will suffocate you.

499,Google,"- Stakeholder management is rough. It's a huge company that refuses to adapt to being a huge company. If you worked at Samsung or Amex, there would be a clear hierarchy of decision-making and approvals. Google is huge but teams rarely have any clear approval processes, decision-making processes, etc. It is all decided by individual team managers, most of whom don't set up a process at all or stick by it. So you end up halfway finished with a project, and then your manager will ask you to get approval from a random PM, and then you have to start all over. It's insanity and nothing gets out the door on top because of this. - Bad managers are never held accountable. Basically if you're a star-performer individual contributor, you'll get a direct report, under the assumption that you'll create even more value when you have help. Not because you display any great leadership or managerial prowess. If your team continues to *produce good work*, you'll keep rising and you'll certainly keep your team. If you get consistently terrible management feedback scores, you'll still get promoted if you produce good work. Bad managers never get held accountable, your feedback will not get any serious response - just a LOT of meetings to ""discuss"" what's wrong and some vague action plan like ""manager will send more regular updates and hold more 1:1s"". Consequently, finding a team where you do work you enjoy AND there's a great manager is like finding the holy grail. - Product excellence and solving for users' needs is not really strongly prioritized. Instead, you feel a strong sense of ""we can't fall behind and thus are creating a copycat product from our competitor"" - see Google Home, messenger apps, Google Shopping Express. PMs are incentivized to ship products, and often things go out the door that lack product-market fit.","- Some of the best colleagues you'll ever find.

548,Google,"If you don't work in MTV (HQ), you will be given work. However if you are passionate and want to advance your career, you should relocated to MTV. Any project that started doing well and getting important seemed to get transferred there. Promotion opportunities are better there. It seemed that everyone who relocated from another location to MTV, was a lot happier. Officially, the company focuses on impact. In practice, it seems to focus on being highly productive in producing code, but not necessarily in actually succeeding. In theory, if you have a simple idea that doubles the revenue/customer satisfaction, it should be more appreciated than an idea that took a lot of effort/difficulty and had less improvement. But it tends to be the other way. Promotions tend to be tied to launching a project that makes peers at a higher level happy. That's often easier with an API that happens to be really useful for peers than launches that benefit users. Landing the right kind of project to work on is a big factor of getting a promotion, which is easier in MTV and also encourages politics. A colleague was told directly from his boss that he has to get better at ""turf war."" A general rule of thumb is that everyone ends up in ads. Non-ads projects tend to be more volatile and have a tendency to end with people ending up on ads projects. This is not necessarily a con. One should simply prepare for it. There seems to be a general trend as Google gets larger (60K+ employees) and the founders are withdrawing their impact on the company that Google's specialty is fading a bit. Microkitchens stock less eye popping snacks and drinks. The Christmas gift went from a nice bundle of cash to a coveted phone to a cheap phone to simply a donation to a charity of your choice. The hiring bar seems to get lowered to satisfy the need to hire more people. Managers tend to become managers for their tech skills and not management skills. It definitely shows in the quality of management. Very smart people, very technically capable, not so business and people savvy. This is not necessarily a complete con because a manager without a clue in tech is definitely a lot worse. There are some stars that people belief that Google still has but doesn't. The myth of 20% time is alive outside of Google. It's discouraged inside of Google. The only person whom I knew to participate in 20% time did so by working on another team, which he wanted to test out before transferring. Outside people belief that 1 day a week a Google can work on anything he/she deems interesting. Management doesn't outright deny it, but it's formulated as: If you work 20% time on something else, it has to have company impact worth 20%. This is not necessarily a con. It's more like a missing pro. Another shining star that's gone is the ""don't be evil"" motto. It was silently dropped and replaced with ""do the right thing."" Google didn't turn overnight evil. There is some philosophical case to be made why the new motto is better. However it seems with the founders drawing back from company involvement that the dramatic standing up for users of the old times is also fading. Google is still a far cry from Monsanto. If you work there and want to advance your career, don't volunteer for anything. It is kind of viewed as a ""vacation"" if you volunteer for things. For example at other employers, interviewing was viewed as a prestigious activity reserved for the most trusted employees to shape the future. At Google, any hour you spend interviewing means missing an hour to increase your performance score. You'll be rewarded for finding ways to dug out of the interviewing responsibility. Again this is not necessarily a con, simply something to understand. You are going to meet some of the brightest and most brilliant people. You are going to meet people with interesting backgrounds. You are going to have wonderfully engaging conversations. But all of that intelligence tends to also have caused nature to create that intelligence at a trade-off (in some people). Perhaps a lack of humanity or emotion was the price of it in some people. You are going to have some lunch conversations that are going to make you spit your food back out, like a colleague seriously proposing to use nuclear bombs to solve social issues. I sometimes felt the need to take a break from the office to be around people who display normal emotions (or any emotion). While the general office culture is very liberal/progressive, there are some pockets of social beliefs that are breathtaking to how little they care about human life or different lifestyles/opinions out of some law of the strong or ultra libertarian reasoning.","Google is a world of its own. At every other company, there were lots of people who had serious gaps in their skills. At Google, I could have a serious work conversation about technology with everyone and could trust that they have solid expertise. In that way, Google is a sheltered garden from the rest of the world. There is a general sense of trust in the company. You can leave your valuables and laptops lying around, and they are safe. People joke that it's the only place where you use an expansive laptop to reserve a seat at the cafeteria, while walking away. At other companies, teams are very protective of their own code. Trying to execute another team's code requires following a 50 step installation process that's out of date and was never complete to begin with. Google has almost all the code in the same source repository. An engineer can look at the code, easily execute the code because it comes with intelligent defaults and standard build process, and contribute enhancements/bug fixes. The other teams are generally grateful for getting improvements. They understand that it's better for the company if the bug is fixed rather than holding onto territory or insisting on their own strange ways. Google takes care of you all around. From food, health care, generous vacation, onsite gym, and so on, you are well taken care off and can focus on work rather than dealing with life's hassles. There are cases where Google goes above and beyond tremendously. Here is an example that floats around internally. A Googler had worked at Amazon before. Amazon relocated him. Because of the relocation, he had to change his partner's health insurance for some critical and expensive life changing medication. Due to same sex partner and relocation, the health insurance company refused. Amazon was so unhelpful that the HR representative who was forced to deliver the news broke down crying and then quit over it. He switched to Google. The Google HR department negotiated an exception for him with the health insurance and included the necessary change for the following policy year for all employees. A lot of Google products have a huge impact with over a billion users. Working there, you can feel that you change the world. I was very happy with the compensation. There are also a lot of opportunities in the company to follow your interest. Pretty much anyone can get an intern, participate in setting coding standards (obviously you have to argue the case for your proposals), interviewing, supporting local schools with tech expertise. Google opened up a lot of opportunities in the community or in general in tech to volunteer in. Google is considered the largest functioning anarchy. That has its good sides, like the glee of joy for operating without strict oversight. It also has its dark side, like a hands-off management tends to encourage politics. Another beauty for engineers are internal tools. Your development environment is in the cloud. You can sit down at a loaner computer and be productive within seconds. There is a massive cloud compiling system that shards your compiles across many computers in the cloud. The search function across the codebase is powerful. You'll feel that downloading and compiling code on your own computer in your IDE is something of another epoch, like something from before the industrial revolution. The Google badge is a wonderful thing to carry. It opens doors to a different world. The office spaces are beautiful with work, rest, and play areas. The MTV location is like a utopian city on its own. Everything in it, food, drinks, work spaces, swimming pools, gym, bowling alleys, showers, and so on are free (for employees). It is a whole world of its own. Most companies have a one-over-one promotion model. Your boss has to decide to promote you. Your bosses boss has to sign off on it. At Google, the promotion is decided by a relatively impartial committee that due to promoting lots of people has experience in it. You can even get promoted in rare cases against the will of your manager. Rumor has it that managers won't hold a grudge if that happens but support it. The hiring committee looks at a promotion packet that includes reviews from peers. There can even be unrequested peer reviews. In general, it creates an environment that discourages bicycling - bowing to the higher ups and kicking the lower downs hard. However some people have realized that they can hurt colleagues with bad reviews and impunity. It's rare, but colleagues careers took a dive due to someone holding a grudge or simply writing a thoughtless review. (There is some concern about stack ranking, but I don't understand enough of the background to comment on it. There are plenty of discussions with insight elsewhere.) To underscore how Google is one of a kind, there is an internal database with legendary things that happened at Google. Someone parked his car for many years on the employee parking lot. When after years, he went looking for his car, it was gone. He went to security. He found out that it was simply moved because the parking lot had been repaved. Another Googler lived in the office fulltime to save money on rent. He wrote a guide on how to do that. As there are showers and other facilities, it is possible to do so. And Google let it happen. After a while of saving rent payment, he could afford the down payment on buying his own place. All these stories make Google a wonderful place to work at. An important topic to bring up is work/life balance. Work/life balance is an amorphous topic that means a lot of different things to different people. Getting up to speed at Google is consuming. Depending on your work, it could take a year to become productive. Many colleagues reported no longer having a personal life after starting at Google. Some colleagues simply love technology and can't think of anything better than working until the AM hours on some tech that gets them excited. You can tell these people by physically looking at them. For them, it is a heaven. If you are a balanced person with personal interests and relationships, you are likely going to be challenged. If you signed up for one of the big five tech companies, you wanted challenge, right. If I would do something differently, it is to take advantage of all time saving things. Pay for a laundry service. Pay for a cleaning service. I've had a moral hangup about doing that because on a moral level, my time shouldn't be more worthy than that of another human being. If I could do it all over again, I'd pay for every possible service to save time. In the grander scheme of things, if you work at Google, your skill is so valuable to humanity that you should make use of it instead of standing in line at the grocery store. I don't mean that in an arrogant way. If you work on a service with a billion users, your ability to make life better for them with another hour of work is worth more than folding laundry. You've paid the price in education, training, and effort to be able to do that. Make use of your power for the great code. (The view that all those perks are only there to keep your nose closer to the grindstone is the wrong way of looking at it from a philosophical point, in my humble opinion.) For full disclosure, there are some people who coast at Google. They probably don't have any complains about work/life balance or perhaps the worst complaints because they are all about coasting. Many company mishandle projects. When the next time comes around, they mishandle it in the same way because the people responsible aren't the ones working late nights and weekends. Google does two things to get better: (1) There are honest and public postmortems. They are the pride of a lot of true engineers. (2) Zeitgeist is an annual survey about the work place and the company. The survey is quite exhaustive. Every manager from the CEO to the front-line manager reports on the result of his/her area. Then they take actions to attempt to improve areas that got low scores. Having worked at companies where now improvement effort is done, this annual and systematic process is very refreshing.",5.0,"""Unique, one of a kind dream job"""

Generally, Google still behaves a lot like a startup, which is not really the right model for a company nearing 100,000 employees. The product strategy is poorly thought out and the culture encourages teams to spin up new product efforts without doing their homework and thinking beyond the first launch. As a result, many new products end up getting launched which have poor longevity. Google also expects that every product scale up to the billion+ user level which means that many niche products don't get the support they deserve. Finally, leadership has become increasingly disconnected from the rank-and-file of the company, and trust in HR and leadership is very low. The most obvious example of this was the $90M payment to the head of Android after being accused of sexual harassment, but there are countless other examples of recklessness and poor judgment by the company's leadership.",Some of the best engineering talent and systems in the world.

I was honest with the Google recruiters and told them I had an offer on the table. They told me Google would offer me the job b/c my interviews had gone well (I did all of the hangouts, went onsite, etc.). They even asked me what the offer was and assured me that Google would beat it. We discussed exact figures. Things were going great. We communicated multiple times, both on the phone and through email. Each time, they said an offer was coming &amp; repeatedly told me not to sign with anyone, but I'd have to wait a few more days or ""next week"". Eventually, the other company pulled their offer. I informed the recruiters of this and they said they'd have a verbal offer for me in the coming days. By this time, we are about 2 months into the process. I've heard that it can take up to 3 months to get into Google, so I was complying with everything they said. Another week went by. Late on a Friday afternoon, I get a voicemail (not a phone call) from one of the recruiters. She says there is no offer and she cannot tell me why, but I can call her if I have questions. Of course I do, so I call. She will not pick up. I left her a voicemail, asking for her to get back to me. To this day, she is yet to return my call.

699,Google,"I left Google Cloud almost 2 years ago to join a different org in Google. My experience in Cloud was disappointing, and not a day goes by where I don't regret leaving earlier. My current team, while not perfect, treats me with respect; it really goes to show how huge the variation can be across Google. Here are many lessons I've learned in my previous team which I hope will benefit you: - If your project is not listed as part of an OKR (Objective &amp; Key Result), no one cares about your project. While most managers will make sure you have a project that can grow your skills and career, many won't and may even try to mislead you into believing your project is more meaningful than it is. Voice your concerns, and firmly ask for a meaningful project. As an L3 engineer, it is not your duty to come up with projects, so your manager has the responsibility to find a good one for you. - If you feel your career is going nowhere, transfer to a different team (which can be done without manager approval after 1 year). Do not fall into the sunk costs trap of refusing to leave because you didn't get what you wanted out of your 1 year on the team. For my first half year at Google, I fixed bugs, set up system health monitoring, did deprecations, refactorings, migrations, etc but never had a genuine project. I thought that after a half year of BS work, I would be given better opportunities. Then, I was assigned a monolithic project. I worked long hours to move the project forward. However, our sibling team repeatedly bailed on their responsibilities in the project, and I had to continuously adapt the design accordingly. Eventually, it became clear that our sibling team was not going to contribute anything, and I felt I could no longer leave the team because the project would require significantly more work than initially anticipated. After one year of working on this project, our management decided not to launch without any basis. If you're not treated well after a year, don't think your coworkers and boss will suddenly start treating you well in your second year or even third year. Don't be idealistic or loyal because Google was rated #1 in employee happiness; it's a big company and not every team is the same. - Management is perfectly fine wasting 1+ years of your time rather than have an honest conversation about the relevance of your project. On my previous team, this was the norm, not the exception. See the previous bullet point for one example, but this had also happened to my next project, as well as many of my coworkers' projects. The reality is: Managers don't face as much penalty for cancelled projects as engineers. Some managers have 30 reports working under them on a variety of projects, and the performance evaluation has a word limit and a limit of 5 projects. If a project fails, managers can just add more words to the other projects. However, as an entry-level engineer, you may only be working on 0-2 projects, so a cancelled project is much more detrimental to you. The same applies for cross-team collaborations. Make sure the partnering team has a tangible investment in your project. People have a tendency to promise commitments for a reputation boost, but when it comes to actually doing the work, they will flake if there's nothing in it for them. One way to reduce the chance of your project getting abandoned is to make sure your project is part of your team's (or the partnering team's) OKRs. Managers have an explicit responsibility to fulfill their OKRs. - In 1-on-1 meetings, do not believe everything your manager says about your career path. Actions speak louder than words. Has your manager been giving you ample project opportunities for growth? Are you getting opportunities for impact comparable to your peers? If the answer to these questions is no, you're not on a strong path to promotion, no matter what your manager says. At Google, performance evaluations are done at a cycle of every half-year. In my second cycle, my manager told me I performed well, and was on track to getting promoted in the next cycle. In the following cycle though, my manager said it may take another 1 year before I would get promoted, even though I never received any indication I had gone off-track. While I would imagine most managers are honest about your career growth, some aren't. By telling you that you have a chance at promotion in the next cycle even if it's not true, they have effectively kept you for another half-year and postponed any consequences for their dishonesty until then. Also, it does not matter if you're assigned an unimportant project or your coworkers failed to do their part. No one is going to say: ""Johnny's project failed to launch, but Johnny did an excellent job and deserves to be promoted anyway"" because it implies someone else should be blamed, and no one is willing to make that sacrifice for you. Also, the promotion committee frankly doesn't care; they need to see measurable impact because that's one of the criteria for promotion, regardless of whose fault it is.",+1 star for the good perks.,1.0,"""Management does not care about you"""

Here are many lessons I've learned in my previous team which I hope will benefit you: - If your project is not listed as part of an OKR (Objective &amp; Key Result), no one cares about your project. While most managers will make sure you have a project that can grow your skills and career, many won't and may even try to mislead you into believing your project is more meaningful than it is. Voice your concerns, and firmly ask for a meaningful project. As an L3 engineer, it is not your duty to come up with projects, so your manager has the responsibility to find a good one for you. - If you feel your career is going nowhere, transfer to a different team (which can be done without manager approval after 1 year). Do not fall into the sunk costs trap of refusing to leave because you didn't get what you wanted out of your 1 year on the team. For my first half year at Google, I fixed bugs, set up system health monitoring, did deprecations, refactorings, migrations, etc but never had a genuine project. I thought that after a half year of BS work, I would be given better opportunities. Then, I was assigned a monolithic project. I worked long hours to move the project forward. However, our sibling team repeatedly bailed on their responsibilities in the project, and I had to continuously adapt the design accordingly. Eventually, it became clear that our sibling team was not going to contribute anything, and I felt I could no longer leave the team because the project would require significantly more work than initially anticipated. After one year of working on this project, our management decided not to launch without any basis. If you're not treated well after a year, don't think your coworkers and boss will suddenly start treating you well in your second year or even third year. Don't be idealistic or loyal because Google was rated #1 in employee happiness; it's a big company and not every team is the same. - Management is perfectly fine wasting 1+ years of your time rather than have an honest conversation about the relevance of your project. On my previous team, this was the norm, not the exception. See the previous bullet point for one example, but this had also happened to my next project, as well as many of my coworkers' projects. The reality is: Managers don't face as much penalty for cancelled projects as engineers. Some managers have 30 reports working under them on a variety of projects, and the performance evaluation has a word limit and a limit of 5 projects. If a project fails, managers can just add more words to the other projects. However, as an entry-level engineer, you may only be working on 0-2 projects, so a cancelled project is much more detrimental to you. The same applies for cross-team collaborations. Make sure the partnering team has a tangible investment in your project. People have a tendency to promise commitments for a reputation boost, but when it comes to actually doing the work, they will flake if there's nothing in it for them. One way to reduce the chance of your project getting abandoned is to make sure your project is part of your team's (or the partnering team's) OKRs. Managers have an explicit responsibility to fulfill their OKRs. - In 1-on-1 meetings, do not believe everything your manager says about your career path. Actions speak louder than words. Has your manager been giving you ample project opportunities for growth? Are you getting opportunities for impact comparable to your peers? If the answer to these questions is no, you're not on a strong path to promotion, no matter what your manager says. At Google, performance evaluations are done at a cycle of every half-year. In my second cycle, my manager told me I performed well, and was on track to getting promoted in the next cycle. In the following cycle though, my manager said it may take another 1 year before I would get promoted, even though I never received any indication I had gone off-track. While I would imagine most managers are honest about your career growth, some aren't. By telling you that you have a chance at promotion in the next cycle even if it's not true, they have effectively kept you for another half-year and postponed any consequences for their dishonesty until then. Also, it does not matter if you're assigned an unimportant project or your coworkers failed to do their part. No one is going to say: ""Johnny's project failed to launch, but Johnny did an excellent job and deserves to be promoted anyway"" because it implies someone else should be blamed, and no one is willing to make that sacrifice for you. Also, the promotion committee frankly doesn't care; they need to see measurable impact because that's one of the criteria for promotion, regardless of whose fault it is.",+1 star for the good perks.,1.0,"""Management does not care about you"""

752,Google,"The big cons fall into two categories: engineering and company. Engineering specific: 1. The internal tools, compared to open source projects and other companies, suffer from immense proliferation and domain overlap. There are too many ways to deploy code, too many ways to look at a metric graph, too many ways to build a Java library, too many ways to spin up an RPC server, and the list goes on. This ultimately means that none of the products are very satisfactory. There's too much license to ""innovate"" on the fundamental building blocks, and the engineering culture as a whole needs to enforce more standards. 2. It's an extremely common practice for engineers (i.e. with a title of software engineer) to have direct reports. The result is a bunch of very technical leaders who don't care as much about people operations. This is great when you need backing for a proposal, but sub-par when you need to talk about career development or other non-technical topics. 3. Technical Googlers are promoted predominately for ""impact"" - think launching a new service, or saving the company $Xm. There does not seem to be heavy motivation to promote engineers who work hard to maintain stable and important systems. It's a running joke that in order to get promoted, it's better to deprecate something reliable and create something new. In other words, Google is an excellent place to gain experience, but to get ""promoted"", you're probably better off seeking out new opportunities. 4. While mostly good people (especially at a company of 80k), Googlers can sometimes come across as entitled. Yes, finances in the Bay Area is hard even on a salary of $120k+, but the perspective on how much of a privilege it is to work here is sometimes lost. 5. Google is struggling with some of the same issues that the US is politically. The company has the best intentions, but does fall into a hysteria over ""diversity"". Less than 50% hiring of females in engineering is seen as a systemic problem. Google is slowly starting to realize that this is mostly a pipeline problem, especially considering that the industry (and company) makes enormous efforts to hire existing qualified women. However, leadership does not seem very interested in respectful but contrary opinions on this topic, as the firing of James Damore demonstrated. If you care about racial and gender equality, but have doubts about a leftist political agenda, you may occasionally feel afraid to speak up at Google.","Google, despite its problems, is a great place to work for. With a few caveats, anyone interested in challenges should consider working here. 1. In contrast to recent complaints within the company about compensation, you are well compensated in engineering here. Period. You might be able to find better at a startup or another big tech firm, but make no mistake, Google pays highly overall. Look at the salaries page here on Glassdoor and you'll see that right away. 2. The office atmosphere in Boulder is great. As a satellite office with experienced-trending engineers, it's more relaxed than Mountain View with most of the same perks. A decent gym, bouldering wall, and full cafeteria are all things to mention. 3. Work life balance, while very team dependent, is generally superb . I work 8 hours a day, don't carry a pager, and feel no pressure to work more than that. I don't feel the slightest bit of scrutiny if I need to work from home, or go to a comfy nook somewhere out of sight to get some work done. 4. Again, in contrast to recent complaints from Googlers, the senior leadership at Google (thinking of Sundar here) is *very* open. Find me another 80,000 person company that has its CEO answer crowd-sourced questions on very emotional issues like compensation and diversity. 5. I generally have positive human interactions here. There's the typical swath of introverted and occasionally awkward engineers, but generally speaking everyone is ""Googley"", i.e. considerate at a level above the average human on the street.",3.0,"""Positive experience with some typical big company problems"""

800,Google,"Where do I start? In the beginning, all was great! Ques were full and you could make a decent income. As time went on, it's just gotten worse. The final nail in the coffin is their new pay model that now pushes commissions and sale incentives. We are no longer stylists. We are now expected to be online sales people! There is no rhyme or reason to the new pay model. One minute you are in the Platinum tier making good money and the next you are in a lower tier making a fraction of what you were making before. There is no explanation as to why you are promoted or demoted. It's like you are being punished when you move down a tier because you are no longer meeting their expectations and you will now make less money and have no idea when you may move up again. It's cruel. You are messing with peoples income. It's not right. I now work harder and longer hours to make less money despite following the laundry list of their new requirements and examples. We have to send the highest standard messages, send at least 35 items per message and stay with in the users profile requirements. It now takes me at least 10 minutes to send 1 message and that's not only because of their new expectations but also because of all the technical issues. We still get a daily ""Bad Request"" pop up message when trying to send messages and it interrupts your flow of work. Also, if the user doesn't put in all of their sizes, it limits results and we have to then manually do it which takes even more time. Not to mention Google Shopping is still not working. You have to manually click on each item to get the ""+"". This all takes more time and becomes so cumbersome. It's ridiculous! You put in so much time and effort for what? To make less $$ now than you did before despite elevating the quality of your work. You feel like a fool. Also, they keep on tooting sales and commissions as a good thing. I have yet to see it!

927,Google,"Promotions are extremely demanding. When in doubt, the entire organization defaults to ""no,"" so you'll need to jump through a lot of hoops to get promoted. Promotions are centered around complexity and impact, which tends to discourage simple solutions to important product problems, as well as low-impact but important work like code maintenance. There have been some attempts to encourage more code maintenance but in my opinion it isn't being rewarded enough. As a result, there is a number of roles that people take on that you tend not to see, most notably that of the code style stickler whose impact comes in the form of improving existing code. Also on the topic of impact, you can execute a large, multi-year project and still not get promoted if it doesn't land with the expected impact. -- This depends on personal preference, but the office spaces are almost universally open-plan, which some people find makes it difficult to focus. Google NYC has been in a real estate crunch for over four years, and people are being hired faster than we can build office space to accommodate them. Lots of trading floor-style desks. -- Personal projects and side hustles are limited to what doesn't compete with any Google products. In theory it sounds reasonable, but in reality Google has a finger in pretty much every pie, which means you'll have to ask permission for everything you make outside work.","Brilliant colleagues, excellent engineering standards, a clear career progression, ample mentorship, challenging and interesting projects, exposure to the bleeding edge of technologies, excellent work-life balance, top-notch code standards, great benefits, delicious food, beautiful work environment.

1577,Google,"- Competition is fierce. Everyone is striving for limited promotions and visibility, and that leads to people sabotaging or just not helping each other. - Managers are powerful.

Honestly, applying to Google from the outside is easier than trying to join a new team. If your manager doesn't want you to switch teams, you will not switch teams. - HR will not help you if a problematic situation happens. They are there to protect the company. While nice individuals, they will happily tell you untrue information to help Google and hurt you. - Promotion culture is insidious. Everyone is trying to get promoted to make more money, and the system around promotion encourages the wrong kinds of risk-taking: bold but useless new products, hoarding credit, blaming others for your mistakes. - If a product is at risk, one or two people may be collectively blamed to save the whole. I saw this happen multiple times. A deadline is missed, so an agreement is hatched the the problem was person X or person Y. That way, person X or Y can be fired and the others promoted because they made progress despite working with someone as lowly as X or Y. - Fakeness. Individuals at Google are largely wonderful, but the company encourages you to keep and tow the line. Smile. Be Googley. Pretend we're all collaborating openly. But, in the back of everyone's mind is their career path, their promo, and how other people can be used to get them there or discarded if they do not. - A few PMs and manager are very poor performers and their teams suffer as a result. Many PMs and managers are wonderful. It depends on the team you get, which is largely a question of luck. - A culture which somewhat coddles through its benefits leads some to stay dependent and socially immature, especially if joined right out of college.","- Work with genuinely smart and creative people - Beautiful offices, delicious food - Great benefits and healthcare - Lots of learning available through talks, programs, classes - Great deal of transparency across the organization - Room to take risks and propose initiatives to receptive audiences - Candid and honest communication from c-level leadership, including acknowledgement of mistakes",2.0,"""Behind the shiny veneer, insidious politics and dysfunctional teams"""

Especially on the manager track, the size of organization you manage seemed to matter more than how good of a manager you were. In many parts of the org, it became impossible to get the promotion to the next level unless you had a manager who was really good about helping you carve out space to manage a large organization within their org. Career development is mostly an exercise for the reader. There's lots of opportunities available, but you have to go out and find them and push. Don't expect someone to guide you along career development. At the senior levels, you're at a huge disadvantage outside of Mountain View. And if you're in MTV, you're either suffering a huge commute from SF, or living in an extremely overpriced boring suburb.","When I was at Google, the company was growing rapidly, and I was able to grow with the company.

I had no clear direction on my role, or even what the outcome of the project the team was working on, no matter how many times I asked. I quickly became bored and frustrated and soon realized that I was not learning anything new, and the transferrable skills I did bring were not being utilized. That's when I started looking outside the company, and here is what I found at my new job: 25% increase in salary, 50% more vacation time and 150% increase in bonus target. Once I left, I realized just how old fashioned Google really is regarding Management, Performance Reviews, and other HR-related issues. Perf and Calibration were abandoned by most companies years ago because it doesn't work in identifying the best performers, but at Google it defines you forever. Lastly, during orientation the advice given to the Nooglers is ""don't be a jerk"". It turns out that I have never worked at a company that had more jerks than Google.

I went from amazing managers and sponsors to the worst manager ever. Just because a manager takes a course doesn't mean they have adopted the lessons taught. I suffer from a disability that is episodic and goes into remission at times. At the end of my time with Google, despite needs for accommodations due to my disability, my manager declined a request to work in a quieter and more private work space. HR took their time. In addition, I was only allowed to work from home on Fridays. I was also penalized on my performance review for not being able to work in a more visible work space. This is important to note. I went from a high performing employee for 4+ years and then got sick and within 3-4months was rated as a Needs Improvement by my manager who had only managed me for 3 months and the one before 5 months. At Google, your MANAGER has the final say on your performance review. Despite high ratings from everyone else, HR stands firm about letting the managers rating be the overall rating and override all other reviewers. Google needs to understand that not all people work or learn the same way. Don't expect reasonable accommodations to be honored here. They took 6 weeks to respond to my drs note for a medically necessary accommodation. This is NOT a space if you have any type of disability especially cognitive or mental ones.

If a direct manager likes an employee, then it's a walk in the park, otherwise prepare to be stonewalled or have to resort to some serious brown-nosing to get ahead. Also, leveling-up gets super competitive due to the large size of the company. Transferring teams is a challenge, so most employees grin and bear it for a couple of years, or leave the company. It's hard for outsiders to understand, but this happens to a lot of Nooglers, and ""re-Noogler"" events are done for employees that complete their first year. It's unfortunate, but after the ""rainbow-colored glasses"" come-off most new employees burn-out . Google seems to bring out the workaholic in people. Politics among teams and Orgs slow everything down, often leading to delayed launches, buggy releases and zero transparency. Also, there's an awfully large amount of bad managers.

I got talked two twice and the third time I got pulled into a room with my manager telling me I had to work at my desk even though I was the top performer on the team. There were major trust issues. Management is truly hit or miss. My first manager was literally in meetings all day and no one got face time. He ended up leaving because he ended up not liking it anymore. Second manager I loved and the team was perfect but she ended up transferring due to how she felt she was treated. The new manager was terrible, pulled down the morale and 3 people transferred out after 3 months. Third manager was brand new and no one trusted her. 3 people left within 3 months. Good management is hard to come by. Competitiveness runs rampant to the point that people will steel your work. If you bring it up like I did after seeing it happen to me 3+ times, management told me that's the way Google grooms people and it makes people become competitive. You're surrounded by brilliant people but the imposter syndrome is strong at Google. The way performance reviews are set up, you always have to come up with random stuff to outdo yourself and make you look good. That's good to push you out of your comfort zone but bad because people start making up useless things to show they've been doing stuff. It's silly really. And this is why it's incredibly hard to get promoted is that you have to outdo yourself and outshine your peers.

2641,Google,"Being programmer means being creative. Well, not at Google. You will have artificially created restraints in almost every aspect of your work. Here is an example: readability. In order to being able to commit some code at Google you would need to have a ""readability"" in a language you're writing this piece of a code. It doesn't matter if you have 10 years of experience in that language. It doesn't matter if you have certificate from the company that developed this language. And in order to get readability you would need to write a lot of code in that language. Catch-22. Also, you would have to wait for a pretty long time in the readability queue in order to just start with process. You fill like you lost all the experience you had before with this language. Somebody who has readability and has less experience in this language than you will have power over you. You would have to persuade this other person that your code is OK. Hypocrisy. They still have courses at Google where they teach you that it is important to have a rest, it is important to manage your energy, it is important to work when you are excited and energized and not work when you're not. This is why they have all those massage chairs. It used to be the company that valued all this. It all changed. I saw my manager writing in 2am and then writing in 6am again. Manager sets an example for it's subordinates and this example is terrible. I also remember my manager writing email about his current state that he is sick. At the same email he tells that ""he will do his best to do some work"". At the same time this same manager tells everybody else that ""if you're sick - go home and take a rest and don't work"". I lost respect for my manager long time ago. They want you to deliver results as soon as possible and yet they don't give you the ability to do it. Instead of JUST DOING IT you would have to write design docs with the future possible architecture (which will always be different because we can't predict software development) and persuade people who have more power than you. Those people will do their best to make sure you don't just start working on your code. You would have to pass several rounds of this absurd. They told me it is very important to predict how much time it would take to finish the project. I asked them what is the technique to predict unpredictable and got no answer in return. They told me it is very important to make sure you did your project as close to your predictions as possible. I asked them what stops people from deliberately giving very large estimates, completing a project sooner and just do nothing for the rest of the time. I got no answer in return. I completely lost respect this company. This is absurd. The management don't think about what they are doing and why.

Lack of product knowledge and it's very obvious. - Promotions are selective: ""Favorites"" will often be easily promoted, when others may deserve it more. There is only a certain # of people who can be promoted every cycle. - At times, feels like a sexist environment for women: Males favored, listened to more, and ""boys club"" mentality at management level. - ""Flat"" organization but very hierarchical: Try to hire smart, experienced people in at the low level, meaning you must do everything on your own and feels like you're alone on an island of 1 without help or anyone to manage/hire in below you.

2912,Google,"The global business org at Google struggles with its flat organizational structure; it can be difficult to get promoted or to have your work acknowledged in a very competitive, self-promoting culture. Don't believe everything you read in the press about how fantastic Google work culture is. Although the HR department has made multiple attempts to improve the promotion structure at Google, it can be near impossible to navigate all of the appropriate politics to gain a promotion. Furthermore, a promotion in the sales org at Google does not necessarily mean an increase in responsibility or a title change. Employees usually work in roles 1-2 levels above them in order to first demonstrate that they are worthy of promotion. In this same vein, the opportunities for growth are VERY few within this org, and you often find people moving from industry to industry (within the sales org) to keep their day-to-day interesting. There is a huge bottleneck for middle management to make their way into leadership positions. Most importantly, the leadership within the sales org is severely lacking. Leadership makes decisions well removed from the sales organization itself (and its employees) and often work like politicians to further their own careers, rather than improve the larger organization itself.","Account Executives work as client leads within the sales teams that make up the global business org. Within this role and organization, you receive a great deal of respect and prestige from your clients, as they look to you for strong business guidance. The pay is very competitive, and if you have a supportive manager, the potential to gain merit raises annually is very high (as are the stock refreshes). The company provides many internal trainings for those interested in personal development, and the opportunity to travel to another office in another city/country is readily available on a quarterly basis. Most importantly, it's some of the best people you will ever work with. Aside from the odd, few people who inexplicably make it through hiring, the people who work within the sales org at Google are strong team players, optimistic, creative, strategic, hard-working, quirky and down-to-earth individuals.",4.0,"""Account Executive"""

3011,Google,"- Google is a big company. So there are going to be winners and losers when it comes to career growth. Due to the high hiring bar, most people who don't win are smart people as well and their experience sours. This place is optimized to avoid false positives in every step and false negatives are inevitable. At least when you get promoted, you can feel good that you have truly done something. - You have to have skill to find impactful areas or projects or start one in order to grow fast. A lot of people can't or don't want to do that. They want it lying there in a platter in front of them (I don't mean this disrespectfully. I have been there). This is why smaller companies or startups look attractive. It's easier to grow in a less competitive place and there is nothing wrong in wanting that. In my experience, a lot of people who say Google is boring and young & smaller companies are those that are good at building things and solving problems that a thousand other engineers can solve. They just want a place where it hasn't been solved. At google, a lot of your basic services and infra are built. So the problems to solve get substantially more difficult and requires some lateral thinking as well. Again, no disrespect. There are lot of people out there, including me, who would like interesting problems handed over to us. - in a place of this size, you have to navigate some political issues. - in critical systems like search, you can just push new things (rightfully so). It's a process and you have to convince that your feature can be used by a billion people. I'm sure every company would do this.","- You drive yourself here. If you want to grow, you have to seek out opportunities and prove that your worth. This keeps you motivated. - Tons of interesting projects. There is no dearth of challenging projects that will keep you interested for years. Mobility within the company is easy as long as you are good performer. - You get to work with some very smart people and that makes you perform a notch above. - Management is intentionally less involved in an engineer's life and this avoids micromanagement, bias and single point of failure. This goes with point #1. You are free to define what can be done in your domain (of course you have to sell it). - a lot of basic infra exists and is exceptional. So you don't have to spend too much time on your ""means"" to the end. - pay for performance: if you are a good performer, you are taken care of. - needless to say, perks are amazing. - at Google you will learn a lot of things and you will learn it from the best.

3497,Google,"A lot of the cons below are projections of my experience at Google. Do a TON of research on the role you'll be applying for. Find people on LinkedIn. Scour reddit. Learn as much as you possibly can about what you'll be doing to try and prepare for what's to come. * Your experience at Google will largely depend on your team and/or manager. If you join a bad team and/or a bad manager, you'll be in for a rough 12 months (the minimum amount of time that's usually required to transfer out.) * ANYTHING you do or create outside of work is owned by Google, regardless of whether you used their resources or not to do it. This could be a HUGE issue for you if you contribute heavily to open-source and/or like to build side projects. Google's People Ops **do** look out for people doing this too. * The compensation is okay depending on where you're coming from, but salary is practically non-negotiable (stock units are more flexible, though) and might not even be competitive depending on your area. Lots of funded startups and finance shops pay significantly better for the same level of experience. Additionally, compensation doesn't scale relative to growth. One could double their salary or more within the same amount of time it takes to get from mid-range to senior at Google. * Almost everything that an engineer at Google uses on a daily basis is home-grown and maintained by other Googlers. Much of this tooling is incredibly complicated and takes months to warm up to. This could be a MAJOR brain drain to consider depending on your career path and/or whether you're thinking of staying at Google long-term. (That said, some of the tools were pretty good, though I usually preferred third-party alternatives for many of the others I worked with.) * Most of the sexy projects that makes Google Google are in Mountain View, and if you really want to take your career at Google seriously, you'll eventually have to move out there. Living costs in the Bay are insane and show no signs of restoring sanity any time soon. * Despite having all of the infrastructure to support it, remotely working is generally discouraged by most teams. That said, many, MANY meetings are done completely or partially with Hangouts and Google's solution for accessing internal resources from public endpoints is probably the best there is. * Their interview process is generally terrible. Engineers at Google generally don't like to interview and/or provide feedback, so the interview experience for potential candidates varies wildly across the board. The process also takes a really long time. It took me about four months to get to the offer stage; apparently, that's normal there. (To put this into perspective, I've worked at places that took a week from cold start to signed offer; they can't possibly not be losing talent from these insane delays.) * I don't remember seeing more people glued to their phone or laptop in a single workplace before coming here. It seems like almost everyone travels while glued to their phone here. It's maddening. * Most interviews are focused almost entirely on technical merit. This makes it (much) more likely for engineers with strong technical skills but (very) weak social skills to make it through the cracks. If you're more outgoing and ""extroverted,"" this might bother you. (It bothered me to no end.) * There's lots of exciting work being done at Google, but more exciting work usually means even more operational work. A lot of extremely capable people get slotted into doing that sort of work. Do as much research as you can on your role to give you an idea of what you're getting into. * Technical merit is placed above all else as an engineer. Because this is a significant determinant in promotion decisions, a lot of people spend a lot of time doing ""complex and impactful"" work at the expense of things like documentation or maintainability. As you might imagine, this leads to a lot of reinvented wheels and deprecation. (It doesn't help that every project seemingly *has* to have a name to it that might or might not have anything to do with the project that describes it.) * Work-life balance HIGHLY depends on your team. In my experience, people at Google that spent a lot of time working after-hours did so on their own volition (for better or worse). Management never pressured me to work more than I wanted to; in fact, they've had to tell people to ease up!","* Google has, bar none, some of the best office schemes I've ever seen. Their conference room layouts make a lot of sense, and the designs and liveliness pouring through those walls were on another level. * There are tons and tons AND TONS of teams at Google working on close to anything that you can think of, technical or not, and transferring between them is actually encouraged as long as you're on good standing performance-wise. * Feedback is taken very seriously at Google. It's paramount to their culture and it shows: the Food department cares a lot about turning out high-quality food, People Ops does everything they can to make the employee experience a happy one, etc. Even though it's kind-of a talking piece now, the TGIF sessions with Larry, Sergey and top management are unprecedented. * The food is quite good most of the time. Some of it's restaurant-quality, even. (It highly depends on the cafe you go to and the food you typically eat.) * Aside from a tech startup, I can't think of any other place that's on the bleeding edge of technology at this scale. Google is highly, highly experimental, almost to a fault. (More on that in the ""Cons."") * Their benefits are really generous for a large org. They're not insanely so compared to others like them, but all of the basics (and then some!) are covered. * If you like free stuff, Google will bury you with it over time. I didn't work there very long but somehow got two backpacks, a few shirts and a hoodie. Interns get way more stuff, though.",3.0,"""Great company, but your mileage WILL vary."""

A lot of solutions exist on the outside, but there's often a homegrown competitor that we're forced to use, so it will make that other team look good (lots of folks write libraries and services just to get promoted). -No Node.js support in production. This is especially painful for aqui-hires because many startups these days use Node. Then they find they need to re-write everything to integrate with Google. -Checkin + code review process is super bloated, anal retentive, and obsessive. This slows down development time considerably. This is especially painful for aqui-hires, where no one on the team has readability, so you have to make friends within Google just to get your code checked in. Really, really frustrating and the feeling that productivity has gone down immensely. -Still not a good environment for frontend engineers. If you even hint that you like JavaScript and CSS, people will look at you like you have brain damage. Not a lot of the engineering culture values FE work, although that's a self-admitted problem that they're trying to change. -Fiscal irresponsibility. Hiring rate within the last few years has been out of control and unsustainable. There is a boom time now, but this is going to hurt and result in many layoffs when the next crash happens. -Engineering culture (also listed as a pro above). Specifically non-frontend engineering. This is reflected in the ridiculous interview process. It would be good to get more diversity of thought and perspectives, not just a hard-line engineering perspective. So many decisions are based on quantitative data alone, which is a mistake if a company wants to push the boundaries and wants to be innovative. -Entitlement and elitism. It's not everyone of course. -High cost of living around main campus.

4289,Google,"The cons are flipped versions of the pros: Google hires very smart people and then puts them in fairly mundane roles. They used to try to take your preferences into account when allocating; they seem to do much less of this as they've grown. If you're at all purpose-driven, you'll eventually become restless at work, looking for something with more meaning than the project you're on. You could potentially 20% something, but that notion has always applied more to some groups than others, and the company has tended to downplay it in recent years. More disturbingly, there's a severe opportunity cost to your side projects: their position is that everything that you do in your personal time belongs to them, although that is not what the employment agreement says and would be an unenforceable position in California. They instead get around this by suggesting that everything that touches the web or mobile (and perhaps the desktop as well) is competitive with them. There's a committee that will examine ideas, but it appears to be moribund. Google has grown tremendously, and systematized to the point where it's a large machine, needing an increasing number of cogs to keep the engine running. The culture has been eroding recently because the company hasn't been able to reconcile it with its growth, and because the company has sidetracked from its core mission and thrown resources at ""me-too"" projects such as Google+. I predict that this will hurt the company's outlook in the long term, as most of its revenue generation still comes from relatively few core activities which are exposed to market and competitive risks. As it becomes less entrepreneurial, it becomes less able to diversify into new areas, and thus becomes less resilient. I would expect this to take 5-10 years to become apparent (the market would need to shift in a way that causes one of their pillars to collapse), which means that it may not be an issue for most people considering it now. One other thing I've found is that while they care collectively about their engineers a great deal, they're generally not very willing to go out on a limb to make individuals happy. Food and facilities people are the exception, as they do often take engineers' feedback into account.","Google hires very smart people and allows them to participate in the culture. This means your coworkers will likely be very interesting and fun, and you'll probably enjoy the office environment immensely. You'll learn a lot. The hours are very flexible and the company takes the notion of work-life balance as it applies to the workday very seriously (though there's a dark reason for this). And the perks are second to none. Compensation is also quite competitive as you rise through the ranks. And the food! I still dream about the food. It's a great place to build a stable career if you love coding but aren't super-entrepreneurial and don't make tons of contributions to open source projects (see the cons for why these would be issues).

4891,Google,"Let's be honest: Google spoils it's employees. We're all fortunate to work here. The thing I worry about most is whether I'm making a real difference. Google has such a legacy, and such infinite resources, that it can be a little overwhelming trying to figure out if you're taking full advantage of the opportunity.

I joined Google about a year ago after many years in mid-tier management consulting. For me, it's been a refreshing return to work-life balance. No, that doesn't mean I work 35 hr weeks. I'm often at Google before 7am and sometimes stay past 7pm. I work hard because I want to be the best in my profession, because I believe I should earn all those perks Google is famous for, and because my team, who want to be the best in their professions, are relying on me. That said, I've never worked into the wee hours of the morning. Every Saturday and Sunday you'll find me outside running or biking, not in the office. I have a wonderful marriage, get 8 hrs sleep every night and am fortunate to be leaving a happy life. In contrast, my consulting career was full of 70 hr workweeks, travel away from my family, unbelievable levels of stress and piles of politics. Maybe Google is also like this at the VP and SVP level, I'm not sure. But I'm about half way up the so-called corporate ladder and, at least from my perspective, things are refreshingly balanced and authentic. Again, I'm only 1 year in so take my thoughts with a pinch of salt. The other myth I'd like to debunk (actually, it appears to already be long-before debunked) is that only ivy-grads can get into Google. From what I've heard, this was more true 10 years ago. But, I attended a small undergrad school you've probably never heard of and haven't been back to school since.

My coworkers were extremely risk-averse and were far more concerned about breaking something that already worked than about making progress. Also the culture is biased towards ""perfect"" engineering solutions, and just hacking to get something done is highly frowned upon. This isn't always bad, and you can learn good programming practices and discipline, but unfortunately it just isn't always practical in the real world of deadlines and needing to make progress.

Systematically rewards only short term results, which leads to exponential compounding of code cruft. I mean they give explicit instructions for calibration and promo to consider only demonstrable benefits of the last 6 months of work, and nothing earlier than that which had a delayed benefit. So the rank and file are forced to be like shitty mutual fund managers obsessed with quarterly results, in contrast to the upper management's supposed long term focus. When you start they flip a coin and if it comes up tails you are stuck in ads for years against your will. 20% time is a lie. 20% time is essentially unpaid overtime and if god forbid your 20% time takes a risk and fails you will be calibrated as if you had spent that time doing nothing. Every creative idea is shot down in favor of the same old safe but inefficient crap. All the projects come from the top down. There is no bottom-up innovation in ads because they try to keep everyone 110% busy with top down mandates. The company hasn't really innovated much in years. All their fast growing products are acquisitions or ""me too"" and the ads infrastructure is bloated and ossified. There's a lot of witness-tampering when it comes to peer reviews and stack ranks. You aren't allowed to rate your experience working with a person. You're supposed to somehow rate their entire accomplishment including stuff that you had nothing to do with. And if your stack ranks differ greatly from your manager's opinion of the latter they will passive aggressively hint that it will be a reason for firing you. Valve has a much better stack ranking system where people just rate their own experience working with a person and all feedback is anonymous. Also unlike Valve, Google has no freedom of association with whatever projects you want to do. It's all top-down mandates and selfish horse-trading by psychopathic middle managers. I've read about the toxic culture that killed Microsoft and it sounds very similar to Google in my experience. A lot of the managers were hired from outside the company and tracked their shitty culture in with them. Perhaps that explains it.",It pays well and it has a lot of resources to support big projects.

5130,Google,"Disclaimer: Google is the most decentralized company I've worked for in the degree to which different groups and projects have their own work intensity, culture, ambitiousness, manager quality, etc. A lot of people I know love working here, feel they are working on interesting/important projects, and are full of respect for their colleagues and leadership. My experience, unfortunately, has been almost entirely negative: - problems start with the hiring process because they put up vaguely described job openings, don't tell you almost anything about what you'll be working on during the interview, and then don't make any attempt to match you to projects you might care about or have experience with. The implied message is - you made it to Google, so you're smart enough to learn new technology, languages, and skills as needed, and we give you so much that you should be happy working on anything. After working here for several months, my impression was: - self-satisfaction, detachment/cluelessness/apathy and arrogance are prevalent including at the very top. - too many of the company's core slogans frequently don't reflect reality: - treating employees with respect - actually condescension disguised as benevolence - caring about users - actually often dismissing them as a nuisance or too stupid to use the product correctly. - setting goals that are so ambitious that you fail on some - actually often failing on un-ambitious goals for non-respectable reasons - openness in communicating with employees - actually, most communications end up being empty hype and ass-kissing. - maximise efficiency and productivity - actually, even simple web front ends requires constant battle against unrelated problems with unreasonably slow or broken internal APIs, overly slow build/test/deploy tools, lack of documentation for how to use internal systems, etc. - fast-paced entrepreneurial culture - actually, for too many people, the main objective is to look good and score points with their manager - this is true all the way up to the VPs that report to Larry - hire the best people - almost everybody here is really smart, but the culture often brings out the worst most unprofessional side of people - taking risks and changing the world - level of risk I see people taking is changing the location of a UI button on an internal tool without talking to the product manager first","In my experience, Google is an awesome place to work if: - you get intrinsic enjoyment from writing code - even when asked to spend months coding something for reasons that are unclear or less than inspiring (like lack of planning, inter-group politics, inertia, etc.) - you like reading code, doing code reviews, and having access to the entire source code of most google products. - you plan to work here for at least several years and like the idea of spending your first 3 to 6 months getting familiar with the large number of google-only systems, tools, libraries and coding practices that must be known even before doing small internal projects - even though this knowledge will be mostly irrelevant outside of google. - if forced to choose, you would prefer a high salary, incredible benefits and job stability more than working on projects you care about.

5214,Google,"Finance is a 2nd class function (at best) and in general has very limited power within the organization. This can make it difficult to make a difference or even be heard outside of the org. Often, those who succeed in finance are those that can please their business partners in Engineering/Product which can cause incredible conflicts of interest (sure, that acquisition looks fabulous and it's only $100M! I can make an analysis that makes it look great ) - even if not explicit the pressure to please powerful VPs in Eng is intense. This is compounded by the hyper-reliance on 360 feedback and networking which means it can be hard to make a change or stand up if something seems wrong. Finance is primarily full of investment bankers & consultants, with little folks with actual Corp Finance experience. This causes an amazing amount of inefficiency as folks don't understand how to do basic things like create a budget and expect people to stick to it (seriously - within weeks of budget creation no one knows if budget applies anymore or if we're moving to a monthly forecast view instead). At first, I tried very hard to get more Corp Finance folks in the org but now I actually think IBankers do best as folks with actual CF experience tend to be so shocked by the Google processes (or lack thereof) they simply cannot hang. Work/life balance is dreadful - since the employee base is generally young and former bankers, most folks don't seem to be upset by late nights stretching past midnight but for those with families (or even those that just enjoy their lives outside of work) this can be painful. Especially since most of the time is spent on projects that go nowhere. Google elects not to use ERP or other established software in favor of developing their own solutions. Then they don't staff these solutions with adequate Eng resources. Result is an incredible lack of data availability with the expectation that finance be ""scrappy"" to find ways to tease out or completely guess at the data. Upside is that without a data source no one's likely to know if you're completely off base - but this can be unsettling for folks who really want to use reliable info to make business decisions. There are constant reorgs and reprioritizations at Google - particularly if you don't support the Search / Ads business. Forget about focusing on anything that will take more than 1 Q to achieve. This is a social/extroverted environment which means that those who are good at networking have an edge over those who don't, even if the folks who don't are doing a superior job.

As a result, managers are responsible to new macro functional groups, and new projects or focus areas every month or so. This seems an unnecessary distraction, amounting to 25% superfluous work. The change in org structure has made it hard to maintain the career path of your choice. Instead, you must choose from available Google-centric career paths. These are not always (or often) composed of conventional roles, since Google is both changing rapidly, and unconventional to begin with. Most of the people hired at Google 5+ years ago, don't have the credentials to be hired there today. This complicates internal transfers, even though HR attempts to solve that issue. Those joining Google from acquisitions are rarely hirable at Google in any other way, yet their experience and contributions once onboard are typically at par. This again complicates the internal transfer process.","The following is related to sales operations management.

Also, Google makes it very easy to work your hardest, and that's a huge bonus if you're interested in super-charging your career.

5473,Google,"Working at Google has a stiff learning curve, and it can be challenging to ramp up and get your footing here -- especially if you have been doing software development 10+ years elsewhere and are accustomed to being a big fish. In you aren't on a very short list of luminaries (e.g. a Vint Cerf), then respect and influence have to be re-earned from scratch based on what you do at the company. Your past merits may have helped you get in the door, but inside they buy you nothing. So, to thrive here you have to grow and sustain some inspiration about what's possible, to keep your head above the daily grind of routine work. Working at Google can isolate you from the global technology community, as well as sometimes from our users. We have our own technology stack and internal lingo, so systems and methods learned here aren't always transferable. We exist in an extreme media spotlight, in highly competitive markets, dealing with sensitive information, so we are very cautious about sharing anything externally. The culture tends to be inward facing: everything is on campus (the Googleplex) -- meals, entertainment, perk, education, tech talks -- so why engage outside of the bubble? Our approach is to solve everything with automation so that the system works on a global scale, but human-to-human customer service does not ""scale"", and so is sometimes given short shrift.","Having been at Google longer than 9 out of 10 employees, I still feel the business poses me with fresh challenges and terrific learning opportunities virtually every day. I have been able to pursue several distinct ""mini-careers"" at the company, with promotions and transfers available as I hit major project milestones. The career environment is ideal for someone who thrives on complexity, who takes initiative, and who communicates well and constantly with technical collaborators. I feel that management empowers and facilitates individual contributors. You have a fantastic liberty here to challenge how things are done (whether bureaucratically, technically or in product design). Expect fast and constant change. You can step up and drive that change, too, if you have the chops -- the courage to express a coherent vision, and the stamina and depth of skill to follow through. A high impact project at Google can affect a global user base of hundreds of millions (or is it billions now?), and can shape the course and direction of whole industries. You can provide great benefit to users worldwide. The right answer to a search query can literally save a life, reorient a career, or enrich a relationship. And while search is critically important, we do so much more. When it works, it is a total jazz. When it doesn't work, well, you fail fast and try something new. Everyone outside tends to ask, ""What company will be the next Google?"", but internally we remain quite ambitious: ""My project at Google will be the next Google!"" The people here are great to work with. Passionate about ideas, compassionate toward others, with many innovative superstars, and a culture that celebrates diversity.

5475,Google,"Google, fortunately, is the worst company I have ever worked for. It attracts so many talent people to work for this company, but in fact, the only give software engineers the special treatment. I've seen so many great engineers in operation team were treated like nothing. 1. management sucks My manager is the root cause that every engineer suffers. He is the best politician I have ever seen in my life. Ever since he promoted to be a manager, he started to play all the dirty games among us. He spent $20 mil per year on some equipments which melt down network connectivity so many times every month. He claimed that the equipments would save Google for 10 millions per year, but in fact, we spent a lot more work hours on trying to solve the problems these junks caused. The main problem is, there is no test base for these junks. Aren't we supposed to test all the equipment before we implement or even purchase them? Not these junks... how does it happen? pick ur guess! How about we go the manger above him. Too bad.. the upper manager is his buddy. There is no complain or any bad thing would ever leak out through these 2 layers of managers. They cover everything up very well. In fact, one of the manager's jobs should ensure the fairness. Well... ""fairness"" is NEVER been seen at this team. 2. politics tricks My manager has this policy: all the engineers under level III can not talk to the engineers above level IV. Well.... before I join google, I thought anyone could talk directly to anyone, even to CEO. But my manager fired a person who asked questions to a level IV. His recently move was - promoted two of his favorites to be managers and directly reported to him. You know what it means? He just promoted himself since there are two managers reporting to him now. That was the exact trick his upper manager did a couple years ago. Now... there are 3 levels of management under one director. How does this director allow this happen?? well.. that's the politics. So, when the new engineer join the team, how many levels above him?? It's IMPOSSIBLE that you get promoted if there is one new layer added. Most likely, you got downgraded every year!! 3. STEALING/CHEATING I've never seen so many cheating cases ever since I graduated from college, but here, at Google. We have two level IV engineers responsible for designing networks with one stealing ideas/credits from the other one's work!! And this cheating is permitted by the upper manager!! How did it happen? well... the managers playing the games. The two (now three) levels managers ensures that none of outside team could work with the talent engineer alone. When they steals, those seniors all lined up and the upper manager would give pressure down to turn in the design and the credits. Whoever on the same side of this level IV engineer would suffer a hard time and have bad reviews from those managers. So, we watched the stealing and cheating happening every day but no one dare to say anything. &lt;to be continued&gt;","I think most ppl r proud of working for Google.

Marketing and bigger vision sometimes comes from the product managers, but it always feels like individual advice rather than a single clear vision of where we should go. Individual teams have a lot of control over libraries and code they use, so lots of infrastructure projects grow as research projects that succeed only if adopted by significant numbers of other teams. Although there is a big vision for the company, it isn't as focused or controlled as in other companies; there's really an assumption that the right stuff will bubble up. It's not a place with the razor-focused direction. Initial titles/ranks and promotions are determined by committees of other engineers.

5586,Google,"Office environment – It could be very noisy and interruptive with 5 to 10 persons sitting in one room. It’s not the best setting for strong and independent engineers to focus and develop solid code. There are such engineers in our office that hardly able to focus and be quiet for more than 30 minutes, always talk loud and flatter each other. I am annoyed and disturbed on an hourly basis. Project management: poor project management, lack of discipline and launch schedule. It’s very hard to estimate what and by when project will be launched. There is no one to enforce some discipline on code quality and stability. Launch delay quarter after quarter. When accountability finally comes and the project risks of being canceled, I see desperate launch push and poor code quality. Manager role: Managers and directors usually stay far away from daily project management duties. Manager does not know what individual software engineer is doing so don’t slightly expect such otherwise you will be disappointed. Majority managers are not technically strong and write zero or negligible code. Don’t expect much technical inspirations or lead by example from your manager. You will neither see much career mentoring nor other “soft” help from the manager. I had 1:1 with my previous manager maybe 3~4 times during the whole year period. Despite being the “manager” of our project, all his involvement was showing up a few times in our project meeting and later claims making big impact to the project on his self performance evaluation. Career growth: Despite the peer review model, the manager’s feedbacks appear to be what really matter. People that are vocal and suck up to their managers are very more likely to be promoted. If you are hard-working engineer that is able to and like to solve hard problems independently without making superficial noises, and expect Google to recognize your contributions, you will be very disappointed. I know some of such solid and senior engineers; about half of them already let Google. This is very counter-intuitive given the perception people have about Google. Project and team: Google is primarily an advertisement (instead of technology) company. The web search infrastructure is awesome however only need a relatively small number of people work on that. The available projects for most people, especially in satellite offices, are limited and not technically hard-core. If you are a senior and talented engineer, you may not find a local project that allows you to focus and solve hard challenging technical problems. It also becomes harder to find other senior talented engineers that you respect and love to work on, given senior engineers are leaving and junior engineers are joining. Engineering quality: I am disappointed with the code quality of my current team. Despite Google’s code review standard and practices, too many times people hastily touch existing code or add hacky code with no real testing. Such code checked in and deployed to data center. Overall it requires a lot more unnecessary iterations and bug fixes to stabilize the system. I don’t mind working 60 hours per week at all but it is frustrated to see most time wasted dealing with silly buggy integrated system. There is no engineering process to ensure code quality and stability or make a launch date more predictable. I see a general lack of engineering discipline and experience to implement very solid code from software engineers with no or just a few years experience.","Google is leader on web search and has the best web search infrastructure.

5607,Google,"From my four years of working at Google, I've seen the following downsides: * In sales, management level employees tended to be hired from MBA programs rather than be promoted from within. I was not personally affected by this practice, but I witnessed the demoralizing effect this had on a good number of very high performers who would have benefitted from a performance-education program so that their level of effort and seniority would have been recognized. In addition, as is almost always the case from hiring outside management, there was a great deal of frustration from employees because the manager was completely unfamiliar with the culture and process at Google, and this resulted in a feeling of being managed by someone who learned management at Harvard or Yale. * Google ""over-hires"" people. By this, I mean that Google regularly staffs highly-qualified people in positions that are not suited to their level of education. So, for example, you would see software engineers being hired by support. That's just stupid. I appreciate the high standards that Google has for its employees, but I genuinely think they tend to over-correct in that regard, and this results in people not really being suited for the position into which they are hired. Sometimes it's possible for such people to migrate to other positions within the company to which they are better suited, but often this results in a level of frustration... mostly in this case people find work elsewhere, but in the mean time, this very necessary position must be filled by another hire, which then must also be trained. Not efficient, and not effective. Google also tends to focus hiring assessment on academic scores, which is entirely appropriate for new grads, but they do this even for people with multiple years in the field. That's just silly, and it actually does run contrary to the whole performance process within the company itself, where effort and accomplishments are recognized. Thus, it makes no sense to disregard this type of assessment for new hires whose professional contribution can far outweigh their academic performance by many years. * Google encourages employee contribution to so many different projects that it is difficult for someone to get ""deep"" into a particular project and focus entirely on that effort. In this, I am speaking from my own personal experience. I feel that volume of contribution is valued at times over quality or depth of contribution. There is a sort of ""check list"" mentality where, the more bullet items you can point to, the more you are seen as a strong contributor. I think there should be more attention paid to contribution to items that are complex in nature and require more focused attention. for me, it's just frustrating, because I cannot live up to my own level of quality in my main project because of other demands from other projects.","The very best reason to work at Google can be summed up in one word: culture. Since that is a rather vague term, let me elaborate. Google has established and continues to nurture a culture that fosters, high levels of both work satisfaction and contribution from its employees. It does this by recognizing the potential in all employees via established work policies, rather than just through lip service, like many companies. Following are some concrete examples of this: Promotion and work performances is entirely reliant on peer reviews. In other words, to get ahead at Google and to get a positive performance review, you must get positive reviews from your fellow co-workers. Your manager might love you, but if your co-workers don't like you, you have some work to do. Managers are also required to seek peer review from those they manage. (I have never seen this before in my career.) Senior level employees from other fields are also encouraged to seek peer reviews from people in other departments. For example, engineers need reviews from people other than engineers in order to advance. For this reason, a culture of cooperation is endemic at Google. This is great because the percentage of ""cowboys"" that seems common at other high tech companies is quite low at Google. It also fosters an awareness of the type of contribution made by people outside your department, since everyone reviews people in other fields, and therefore must learn a bit about what others do outside their sphere. Career tracks fall into either management or individual contributor. This is great for people who might want to try management but later decide that they perform best as an individual contributor, or who just want to take a break from management for a while. In addition, it's not too difficult to switch between tracks. Finally, managers and team leads are also encouraged to solicit leadership-level contribution from the reportees, as a way to encourage career growth and to share the load, so to speak. This whole mechanism results in a very strong sense of independence and high-level of function from everyone, because if there is a problem that you think should be fixed, you can fix it and get genuine recognition for it, both from peers and managers. You are required to keep a work log, as a means for you to accurately report on your contributions and as a source for your own assessment and of others' assessment of you. In addition, there are other assessment tools that are big part of Google work life, designed to keep you mindful of your work contribution and to help you and others write performance reviews. This sort of sounds tough, but the end result is that you can work to your best and not have to worry about mis-perceptions of your performance: you've written it down. Additionally, if you are spending a LOT of time working on tasks not related to your main project, your log is a way for you to work with your manager in order to change unnecessary demands on your time. I would say that this practice exemplifies one portion of the transparency that is so pervasive at Google. Ideas and contributions from employees are highly encouraged. This results in some great products for the company, like AdWords, which was an idea from an early Google engineer, and Gmail, which was a 20% project. Googlers also gain a lot of company and community recognition for extra efforts/contributions that they feel passionate about, and this only adds to the environment for everyone. As another example, some employees at Google Mountain View worked hard to create alternative means of fresh drinking water for employees, rather than having the company stock water bottles (which contribute tremendously to landfill waste). This was a big effort. Now we have filtered water stations all over the place--it's not directly tied to ""search"" but it contributed to the company mission to ""do no evil"" and it added to the green image of the company. I could go on and on about culture at Google, and I've only scratched the surface, but hopefullly this conveys a sense of what I mean by ""culture"" at Google and how important this element is to a great working environment.",5.0,"""The very best reason to work at Google can be summed up in one word: culture."""

Google is supposed to have a project matrix where tech leads are peers, not managers, but managers commonly flout this and micromanaging is endemic.

Performance evaluation is supposed to be by peer review but in reality, feedback from peers is ignored and only the manager's rating is taken seriously. Political infighting and character assassination are increasingly the norm at Google. Managers turn a blind eye to it, perhaps because they have found such techniques useful in developing their own careers. Google base compensation is on the low side, and is supposed to be more than made up for by incentive bonuses, but these are largely illusionary because few employees receive the necessary ""exceeds expectations"" performance evaluation.

Do not come to Google expecting a research environment; there's plenty of research going on, but if it's not in your 20% time you'd better have something to ship. I list this as a con only because I suspect this bit some of the people who rated Google negatively. The company has grown really fast. This has caused some strain, both in terms of infrastructure and in communication. Many of the nooglers are fresh out of college, and the naivety cuts both ways: they're simultaneously over-eager to re-engineer everything in sight, and bitter when perks change or they don't get promoted fast (nevermind that it's still better than the rest of the industry -- they've never been there). With rapid growth comes a lack of focus, as well, with weird projects with no monetization story. (Caveat: I'm in Ads, where money matters.) I get the impression that we've got our share of bad managers. My manager (and the two immediately above him) are all great -- technically sharp, caring, and happy to get their hands dirty. But I've heard horror stories from other teams, and you can read plenty of them on this site, I'm sure -- preference for low employee numbers, suckups and yes-men, etc. I suspect most of the thoroughly bitter people have gotten a bad manager and not requested a transfer out from under him/her. On that note, Google does a bad job of handling underperformers. They try hard to help crappy engineers and managers improve, but at some point you've got to cut your losses -- a bad employee, particularly one with a bad attitude, is poison that eats away at morale. I've seen people go through two or more performance improvement plans before finally getting the much-needed axe. Google also does a fair-to-middling job of handling *overperformers*. I've gotten a few spot bonuses for successful projects (which, to be fair, were tens of times larger than the bonuses I got at similarly-sized companies in the past), but the motivating effect of the Founder's Awards are gone. No matter how many millions of dollars you make the company, if you're not in LSE's pet segments, no Founder's Award for you -- it'll go to some guys in search or something. Google is done making millionaires -- for those of us who got who got here after the IPO, the only way we'll retire is a 401(k). Again, having worked in industry outside of Google, this makes me wistful but not angry. I don't expect other people to make me a millionare. And, finally, your family will ask you questions about everything Google related. Be prepared to have to explain dozens of times that you don't actually work on Search/Maps/Writely/whatever and can't fix their pet problem. :-)","Google is the closest thing to a pure meritocracy that I've seen in this industry, and I've been in the industry a fair bit longer than most Googlers. It doesn't matter what your degree is in or how long you've been at the company -- if you get stuff done and do it well you'll be treated well. And, of course, the coworkers are luminaries, but they tend (in my experience) to be accepting of newcomers without the same background. I've had no trouble digging my fingers into topics from machine learning to the Java virtual machine, learning all the while. The company has some communication silos due to its size, but the walls aren't solid -- I routinely hack on other peoples' code, and they hack back. It's all very open. They really pull out all the stops to make sure engineers can do their job, whether you need a second workstation, a thousand more machines in a datacenter, or scones. Information flow within the company is still quite free, particularly compared to Microsoft or Apple. Managers I've interacted with are sharp and encourage good work-life balance, reminding employees to take time off and guarding against burnout. My managers have constantly communicated their expectations and our performance, and have actively worked to help me in my career development and promotions -- or, when a project slips off track, to understand why and help.

Product managers are there to work with engineers to direct the product, as their job is to know the customers and the marketplace and come up with a good direction for products. Because a lot of what the marketplace wants is illogical, engineers often argue with product management, and such behavior is part of what makes engineering a great place to be. You can actually have a significant impact on product direction. Additionally, Google is very fair about how promotions work. The engineers who impress their colleagues get promoted. Those who don't impress their colleagues don't get promoted. Thus, most good engineers will get promoted.

It's not uncommon for entire teams to be uprooted or replaced in one fell swoop. Put together, this leads to an uneasy feeling about one's job stability. One final problem: too many Googlers are young, inexperienced, and short-sighted in their understanding of how much power they actually have in developing public-facing products. They don't understand the implications of their actions, and move too quickly to consider them.","It's a very convenient place to work-- not only are the on-site perks helpful, but employees have plenty of opportunities to learn. Unlike many companies, where employee productivity is dependent already having a certain set of skills needed to get the job done, Google encourages (if not expected) employees to spend a majority of their time doing things they don't currently know how to do. In effect, you are getting paid to learn new skills, and due to the ""act now, think later"" Google mindset, it's generally okay to make mistakes as you learn. World-renowned industry experts regularly lecture at Google, giving the campus an even stronger college-like feel. And in terms of the perks, it's surprisingly nice to not have to think about packing a lunch, to be able to borrow a free car to run an errand, and to wash your stinky gym clothes after working out your frustrations in the weight room.",2.0,"""It's like Jonestown, except without the delicious beverage"""

Marathon hours are the standard because, after all, employees are practically encouraged to bring a cot and sleep there…barracks coming soon (really?! no, not really).

5891,Google,"Context: gTech team - Still too US (Silicon Valley) focused. Incompatible culture with Europe mindsets - Still culturally tailored to 20 something privileged (Ivy league) males e.g. having to share hotel rooms at most events, expecting people to want to relocate, and assuming everyone is the same in terms of motivations and beliefs - BIG ethical problems- see news - Management are very poor: low EQ, lots of turnover/infighting, just care about results not people. Don't like it when people question them even though they say the opposite- lack integrity and many are bullies or just keep their heads down and do nothing. - Many people are managed by people several timezones away leading to poor communications and relations. Fundamental misunderstandings arise because there is an assumption, by the US mainly, that because people speak English they share a culture. - People are very competitive, arrogant, and selfish, don't care about each other as people due to low EQs and being over-privileged or insecure. A person can faint or breakdown in tears in a meeting and everyone will just ignore them. - Low internal mobility if you want to stay in London- it's very competitive and if you enter a bad role/team and have bad projects, it's near impossible to transfer, especially because you need your manager to help. Getting stuck is easy; HR are no help. - Low trust in HR and Employee Relations- so much sexism, ageism and mental health discrimination. Google keeps paying people to keep quiet. HR are near useless (by their own admission) because they have no power. Again, see news. - Company is classic large corp now- ruled by middle managers empire building. Historical culture is not really present anymore, e.g. no 20% projects allowed. - Work is meaningless- little control over strategy, repeating past projects/mistakes, impact of deliverables questionable as they are politically driven more than anything. - Work is still technically driven and people who bring project management experience are not well respected as they are seen as an unnecessary overhead and remind people that Google is now a large company and cannot support old practices such as one to ones with everybody and informal knowledge transfer. - Lots of big company politics and constant problems with delivery because company is still technically driven rather than people/process/organisation driven - Internal systems/tools not fit for purpose unless you are an engineer. Refusal/arrogance-led negative attitudes to using external tools such as JIRA or project management tools. Everyone just uses Google Suite for everything- with some hacky tools built on top sometimes. - Lots of internal snobbery over working for gTech- little respect or knowledge from the rest of Google - Interview system is ridiculously complicated, and has tons of bias, and doesn't recruit the people needed due to the abstract coding questions that people need to answer to prove that they are ""technical"" even when the job doesn't require coding. You therefore end up with people who want to code in jobs where they aren't required to code which causes a lot of problems.","Context: gTech team - Perks, benefits and pay (if those are important to you; they aren't as impactful to most as they think in the long run and create an over-privileged, ungrateful workforce) - Travel and freebies opportunities - Looks good on a CV/outside perception strong - Flexibility in working hours/how you manage your time - Clubs and talks, volunteering opportunities - Stable company",2.0,"""Lost its mojo:  lonely, frustrating and disappointing place to work."""

5973,Google,"From my experience in Google Cloud specifically (can’t speak on other parts of Google), it had all the symptoms of a toxic environment and an unhealthy workplace. It was quite shocking to see and not what you would expect from Google. I was also very surprised as not many reviews on Glassdoor reflected this. In short, there was an abundance of crazy workloads, no work-life balance, poor morale, very aggressive people, strong argument culture (lots of tearing others down), destructive gossip, very political, poor leadership, poor communication, chaos and disorganisation. In more detail: 1. Workloads were very intense with impossible targets and no work-life balance. From what I’ve experienced, the morale was very poor. Employees felt very miserable, were in high stress all the time, were overworked and almost never took holidays. And if they did took holidays, it was very common for them to be working during their time off (often not by choice, but because of the high pressure and intense workload). As much as people loved working for Google (massive brand), not many employees had many positive things to say about being in Google Cloud, but most would endure because of the brand. Constant complaining and venting were very common. Breaking down and crying in the office were also common. It was widely known and acknowledged that this was a problem but for years, not much has been done to correct and the situation remained the same. 2. I was also quite shocked by the style of working. Yes, you do work with very smart people, however, many were also very aggressive. It was their style to get things done and it was what had worked for them. Many others were just good ‘talkers’, but were not good at actually doing things or making things happen. If you’re dependent on them to hit your targets in a high pressure environment, it can be quite challenging to work with. 3. Your experience will probably be better if you had a good manager. I was unlucky to have had a toxic one. I was heavily micromanaged, constantly chased and workload consistently increased. I witnessed the whole team being in a state of misery and being overworked. It was a very negative vibe and very hard to watch. 4. The organisational structure was quite heavy and not flat. You had high pressure, but everything moved very slowly and was overly complicated. There were many layers and many middle managers who were bad leaders with poor leadership skills. Not sure why this was. There were some strong leaders, but very very few. 5. I found the way the company did performance reviews to be quite outdated. It was based on peer reviews and was done twice a year. Because it was done on a peer basis, most would select peers they got along with or those who would give them good reviews. 6. In general, the environment was very chaotic, disorganised, and lots of last minutes. Lots of silos and duplicate efforts. Everything was broken and nothing worked the way it should. So there were lots of firefighting and troubleshooting for very simple things. Systems and tools were usually made in-house and I found many of them to be outdated. The company liked to create their own tools versus using tools from third parties. There were pros to this, but the downside was that many of them were just outdated and inferior compared with other tools on the market, which can make your day to day job frustrating. 7. Overall I do not recommend Google Cloud and would advise anyone to stay away. But if you are considering, do take caution and know what you are signing up for. Do what you can to find out and decide for yourself.","This review is about Google Cloud. Biggest perks were big company name (great to have on CV), big offices, multicultural &amp; diverse colleagues/teams, casual dress code, lots of training courses/seminars available, and supportive of employees relocating to different roles and countries. Salary and benefits were good, but nothing special compared to any other big-ish tech company. Work from home was not ‘officially’ supported, but can be possible depending on your team and manager. Every team was different. Some more tolerant of it than others. Free food was a nice perk, but it's also a bit overrated. I think it's more about the convenience rather than the food being free. E.g. it was nice to not have to think about what or where to eat. Good choice of latest tech. You had a choice between latest Google, Apple, Windows devices for what you needed at work.",1.0,"""Google Cloud - Great brand, but toxic environment"""

6137,Google,"I was recruited by a senior manager and placed in a team, with the expectation that I would provide leadership within that team. The problem was that the manager I worked for felt very threatened. I experienced a lot of anger, character assassinations, and verbal abuse from this manager (who is no longer with the company). I was also not given credit for going above and beyond during 'Perf' (performance appraisal). I was continually told that my work was not up to par or that I was not delivering in line with expectations. I will add that my work in my opinion was of a high standard and focused on innovation. My work was positively acknowledged by other teams as adding value to the wider organisation, and I received an award from the Sales leadership for my contribution to winning several major deals. (This same work effort only received a 'Meets expectation' status in the performance review) Much of my work was taken by my manager to present to her peers. I believe that she passed this off as her own initiatives and dully received a promotion. This was one of the worst professional experiences I have had in my career. It left me feeling inadequate, depressed, and helpless! Google has a 360 feedback process, where you can rate your manager. Her scores were consistently lower than expected. On one occasion they brought in HR to discuss the situation with the team (minus the manager). However they took no real action against her. In the end I had to leave in order to get away from the toxic environment. I tried everything to relate to this person. Nothing worked. And after I left the company I met with others in the team, at their request, to give advice on dealing with her.

6558,Google,"Sadly, all the cool things you heard about Google do not apply to the Google Cloud organisation. A mess of mindless micromanagement, by self absorbed, arrogant, old-guard types. Everybody manages up, but does not share back down. This is easily the most old fashioned sales management team I have ever experienced. The Cloud sales and sales engineering organisations spend a ridiculous amount of time focused inward on things that reduce time with the customer, while offering no benefit to the customer. Combine that with regular fire drills, where EMEA management needs some information (without communicating why) and everyone! scrambles to provide it, with local management just passing things along, all the while pressuring you about your quota. Speaking of: If you are not in retail, don't even think about having a chance to make quota. Most enterprise customers see no reason to work with Google Cloud and even the sales engineers (CEs) haven't found a reasonable answer to the ""why Google Cloud?"" question that gets asked by almost every account. The new leadership under Thomas Kurian is implementing the ""strategy"" of throwing more sales people at the problem, and trying to play catch up on traditional workloads that make money, but where AWS and Azure are years ahead of Google. Not very creative or visionary. Publicly stating this, is even more damning. All of the DACH sales leadership comes from companies that have lost in the public cloud market (HP, Vmware, etc), but bring their mindset of traditional software sales with them. Finally there is a mix of arrogance (we are Google, we know best) and naïveté (if we build it, customers will come) that permeates the organisation. Instead of adapting industry best practices around sales processes, literally hundreds of people internally spend valuable time in creating over engineered processes for large deals that almost never materialise. It is becoming harder and harder to consult customer on GCP, because I'm starting to believe that the company will get bored of it, if it doesn't turn a profit in the next 24 months and will abandon it.","Incredibly smart, talented and diverse colleagues in the sales and sales engineering teams.

This causes unhealthy practices (which are supposedly absent from larger Google) like stack-ranking to still be used.

Some of the perks are also weakened or made useless: attending external conferences can be expensed only for 1/3rd of the cost of the ticket, or 2/3rd of cost of the ticket only if approved by the manager (which in my experience is never granted, unlike what happens with Google's competitors), otherwise you'll also have to use your days off to be able to attend the conference (putting some severe disincentives for you to attend).

6897,Google,"- PR-speak is widespread. Executives use vague CYA communication style. To me it's like hearing politicians talk. Transparency has been steadily going down for years, you hear about projects when they're announced or leaked. - Several high-level execs seem to have a pretty weak ethical compass. Increasing number of ethical scandals, antitrust fines, etc. Internal explanation often weak and unconvincing around these issues. - Lots of talk of being data driven but what's common is data being used to justify whatever fits data slinger's narrative, including for myopic goal setting that results in adverse second and third order effects (see Goodhart's law). - Increasing attitude of engineers just doing whatever they're told, forget the ""do the right thing"" of old times. - Project and product churn. Google products are often unfinished and buggy, UIs changing all the time. Lots of talk of rewarding product excellence but lots of cynicism about it (I don't buy it, I don't see the products getting better). Product managers compete to launch features; engineers have increasingly less power to make product decisions. - If you're more senior you might get pushed to do management, the old days of having a technical individual career option seems over in many teams, at least if you want to get promoted. - Internal frameworks tend to be overengineered and complex because of many disparate use cases and legacy, easy things take a long time as a result. Critical internal tools can be unstaffed while projects that go nowhere (how many chat apps?) can have massive headcount. - Crowded noisy open floor offices, with little privacy. I heard some folks outside engineering don't even get a fixed desk anymore. - AI seems much more important than privacy. Products and strategy seem aligned with getting Google more and more data. Privacy unfriendly defaults, UIs, etc. Might make you uncomfortable if you work on a consumer product.","- Great salary - Great benefits - Generally competent engineers - Culture of helpfulness and quality in many engineering teams.

In addition when it comes to recognition and promotion obviously they build on this type of performance as benchmark so you are screwed if you try to actually have a life. - Flexibility is a myth... some teams are better than other's but most cases you either don't have time to enjoy perks like going to the gym, getting a massage or you are frowned upon if you do.

7951,Google,"- Promotions solely based on something they like to call VISIBILITY. Useless projects get started all the time just to be cc'd on emails to Director-level and above. Those projects in most cases lead to nothing and don't produce ANY results at all, it is solely done for the purpose of being able to mention one's ""great"" initiative in the next performance review cycle. Another factor they promote on are several ""soft attributes"" which is a way for management to promote on subjectivity. - You are always told the company is a meritocracy eventho it is clearly not. This incongruent messaging compared to reality is extremely frustrating. It does not matter at all if you reach 100% of your target or 200%, what matters in the end is the above mentioned visibility. Another proof is that I heard managers say ""Oh, he has been here already for 2.5 years, we have to promote him now"" which is a joke and demotivating for high performing folks. - The metrics you are measured on in an Account Management role are only indirectly linked to revenue and are manipulated by the vast majority of reps once they have been on the job for a quarter and know the drill. Management knows this but does not care since they look good in front of their own bosses if the numbers look good. The best of the manipulators do not have to work at all to reach their targets. - Many of the middle managers are incompetent and have been stuck in their role for sometimes nearly a decade. There is no real willingness to achieve something great and make progress, but those people are just happy where they are in their career and spend their whole day wasting everyone's time in meetings or sending out useless emails. Very limited learning opportunity if you have a manager like this and very demotivating because no one wants to end up like them. However, there is the rare exception of a great manager. - Leadership cult, people of levels of director and above are worshipped through the entire organization and are treated like god's gift to everything. Some of them are admittedly great, some of them aren't. - Learning curve will be non-existent at the latest after 6 months and you will be doing the same day in day out. You can learn by yourself some new stuff with the great online training database, but the main thing you are doing gets old quite soon. - A lot of people drink the kool aid. There are quite a few critical people like myself in the organization, but a majority of people think they are on top of the world because they work in one of the least respected role of a prestigious company. People are not ""super smart"" everywhere, they hire basically everyone and it is just luck getting through the interview process. 90%+ of hires come from personal referrals since their CVs wouldn't go through the official channel.

The company is now a bit of a retirement home for ex-Mckinsey consultants, all of whom are exceptional problem solvers, very nice and collaborate well, but are not used to driving implementation or coaching and leading others. Given the global nature of the company, senior managers are often geographically separated from their mid-level reports, which contributes to a lack of strong mentorship and development of individuals. Corporate culture is now firmly entrenched. This is not a cool, funky start-up. Competition is fierce at the higher levels and there is the usual smattering of office politics and promotion hungry execs pushing their teams to meet their targets and protecting their empires. People seem to be hired at a level lower than they would probably occupy in another company and salaries are not that competitive - they will offer you as little as they can get away with so do not be afraid to negotiate - it does work.","You will work some very smart people, nearly all of whom are passionate, driven and focused on the customer.

The work-life balance is exceptional and managers will often go out of their way to support you in your personal choices and career aspirations. The separation of Google under Alphabet was necessary from a business point of view and now makes it very clear what the business side of the organisation is and does: it is a huge branding and advertising agency designed to make as much money as possible from it's ecosystem. If you are not happy facilitating this mission statement as your day to day function, then it's best to learn to code and join some of the other areas in the business so you can focus on the user rather than the customer.

8699,Google,"Cult of growth. Everything is measured, quantified and evaluated in terms of growth and impact. Exponential growth is expected in every single metric: number of projects, number of users, lines of code, impact, whatever. If something stops growing, it usually gets killed. Do you remember Google Reader? It stopped growing. Look out for your own stats, and get transferred quickly if you stop growing at your current place. Lack of focus. Hyperactive and very disruptive development in most areas, with user experience neglected. It is starting to hit back (as of 2014-2015). Unfortunately, I can't go into details on the consequences of this one, due to confidentiality. Chaos. There is no stable point, everything changes all the time. All documentation is unfinished and/or outdated. Very few people have the 'big picture' and they don't have time to share it, because they have to chase their own growth. Reorganization is continually happening. People come and go, teams come and go, products come and go. Usually we move 3-4 times a year. Noogler onboarding is often forgotten. There's a story about a noogler haunting the buildings for 2 months before finding out whom he reported to. I'm not sure if that ever happened, but I've seen people wandering around for several days. (Now I have the routine to spot them and help finding their team.) Long working hours and stress. This is most prevalent in SRE, but many development teams experience it, too. Cult vocabulary. There are hundreds of words for common things. On top of that, all projects have their internal codenames, and sometimes 3-4 different names refer to the same thing. You can speak whole sentences with words that only googlers understand. Willpower, Ikea, magnet, batman, etc.: those words do not mean what you think they mean. Location-specific issues. The company is centered around Mountain View, and you are almost certainly required to move there if you become important. Other sites (especially non-US sites) provide significantly less perks and choices. Mountain View is extremely crowded, and facilities can't keep up with the growth. Property prices are crazily inflated by googlers, and traffic is bad for the same reason. London still has some office space, but it pays much less than other sites, while living costs are the same or higher. The company sets the salaries based purely on industry average, not on living costs. The London benchmark seems to be flawed. You can't afford to rent any decent flat near the office, and commute is awful during peak times. Offices are open plan everywhere. Waiting for male toilets is very common at most sites. With regards to quality of life, the Zurich site is the most livable in Europe, and maybe New York in the US (until Eric Schmidt applies his stupid crowdedness-makes-you-creative theory).",Competent and mostly helpful colleagues.

Contractors are treated as second class citizens. Even though they are participating highly both in terms of operations and projects. Managers make false underhanded promises about being kept on to many contractors in the hope that this will motivate people to work even harder. But people talk and such strategies become transparent. It is embarrassing spending so much money on parties/off-sites etc. while the contractors slave away and then are told there is no budget to keep them on. (Many of them are far more intelligent than the FTEs and working much harder, and it feels like they know that and are just using them for as much as they can) Googlers have a tendency to become entitled and egotistical. Yes, the physical workplace is great, but it is too much of a bubble and actually the environment is stressful and not really all that friendly. Even the Kitchen staff seem miserable. The expectation of excellence is fraught in the air, which often results in an underhanded competitiveness between team members and long, long working hours. Ya those pool tables are nice, but I never really had time to play them. Googlers are too mono, there is no diversity in thought, age, race etc. Which is a huge criticism really when you think of the values they hide behind and the people they should be considering. If you strip away the benefits and the incredible value of having Google on your CV, this would have been one of the worst employment experiences in my life. I think the difficulty is getting to grips with the frustration of how they are perceived, and how they actually operate. Many of the FTEs have worked nowhere but Google and think they are uber fantastic for having landed a job there and what they are doing is the most important thing in the world but there lack of life experience shows massively in how they handle their work and many of them feel like they are part of a cult.","Great opportunity in terms of adding value to your CV, given the highly acclaimed perceptions of working at Google.

In all my career, the only place I've worked that was even comparable to Google was Wells Fargo (which was a ridiculously unfulfilling place to work as an engineer). Additionally, the culture at Google is very snobby compared to other places I've worked. Managers love to reiterate lines like ""we hire the smartest people in the world"", and a lot of people seem to eat it up. One could argue that this is harmless placating, but the level of groupthink present all over the organization is appalling. Many even consider ""not invented here"" a legitimate reason to build something from scratch, even when there's more robust free software out there (I've been pressured into doing this several times, since the approval process for 3rd party code is so painstakingly bureaucratic). Lastly, I don't feel valued, respected, or even acknowledged by managers. I end up working nights and weekends every week because of clear organizational mistakes being made by managers or other teams. I have been told personally by a manager that a reason for me being pigeonholed into a role I hated was because I didn't go to a top tier school (since another placation they often throw around is that Google is way harder to get into than an Ivy League school, this does once again seem irrelevant). The worst part is that most people don't listen about these things; the times I've told people that we are underorganized and it's going to cause problems later, the general response is to ignore it and/or not be proactive.","Google has a lot of perks, financial incentives, and other benefits that make being a Googler enjoyable.

9414,Google,"Long hours: It depends on the individual, but it's easy to feel that you need to produce more and ending up selling yourself short. The work involves a lot of time wasting ""archaeology"" - sifting through wikis, code labs and other people's code figuring out what is the latest recommended way to do something that sounds boiler-plate and obvious, so it's easy to feel unproductive at times. Also, the availability of free food, gym, etc. on campus and the plenty of fun distractions on its corp network make it easy to spend more time there. Hard to be visible and make an impact. Visibility and Impact are the economy by which software engineers are measured, and they are becoming harder to come by. I feel that most joining now are likely to end up being just a number: average (in Google standards) impact and zero visibility, irrespective of how much of a rock star they were in their previous jobs. It's becoming more and more the target of lawsuits, which basically means that legal fees will continue to cut a larger share of its revenues. In general, operating margins have been decreasing, although they are still amazing. I'm not saying that legal fees are the reason for decreasing operating margins. Google is investing heavily (in new hires, acquisitions, etc) and any benefits from this spike in investment will take some time to catch up with the costs, and there is no guarantee that they ever will. I am a relatively recent (post-recession) hire, and after way over a year on the job I still feel that I am evaluating Google and wondering whether I can have a career here, which is not a good sign. Compared to previous jobs, I feel less recognized, having to work more, less proud of my work, and being more conscious on the effect that specific projects will have on my career instead of just doing what is right for the users/company. It is not that I am less smart/capable/experienced than others, it's just that the opportunities are less compared to someone who joined earlier. The work is not the most interesting I ever done, but it is OK and gives me the opportunity to expand my technical breadth. If this is all Google needs from me, then I am likely to move on, more sooner than later, and if this is a common experience of the relatively recent hires then the smartest and the brightest will not be flocking to Google anymore. Nothing particularly wrong with Google, I assume that's part of a company's normal progression from start-up to behemoth, and I still recommend giving Google a try, especially for new grads as it can be a good place to jump-start an engineering career. Just keep an eye on what you're getting out of your work and don't let the perks distract you from the bigger picture.","Company still growing (and that's a bit of an understatement), both in its core businesses as well as in other businesses in which it is trying to become a major player.

Well, those days are over, and look how well most of those start-ups with their extravagant compensation packages did. You want a fatter paycheck? Create some revolutionary product that raises profits: your paycheck is tied to Google's bottom line. A long time ago people came to Google because they wanted to work for a company that was changing the world, not because Google offered the fattest paycheck. Google compensates well, but if what you're looking for is a new Porsche every year then look somewhere else. I want to work with people who are excited to work on great software, not those who are obsessed with counting pennies.","I've also heard about how Google's stack ranking-based review system is obsolete and is an unfair way to rate employees. I suspect that most of the people who complain fall on the low end of the review scale. Personally, I have never paid much attention to the review process, and I have never felt unfairly treated by it. I am also one of those people who delights in knowing that there is always someone smarter than me at Google that I can learn from. Since I'm always learning from someone, I'm always improving, and always holding my own in the stack rankings. Google does not and should not reward complacency. While I'm sure the review process can be improved, I've also witnessed that it has been slowly evolving for years so I'm content that people are working to improve the process.",5.0,"""Great place"""
9575,Google,"There were two major downsides of doing temp work from home for Google. One was the astonishing lack of communication. This shifted a little while I was working there; they began developing a sort of report card system so that we could see how our rating work scored compared to previous months and how we were doing overall. But while I was there, that system only worked for a small fraction of the projects I was working on, so it wasn't particularly helpful. More to the point, there was no positive feedback given to anyone at all, and communication between employees seemed to be discouraged - two classic characteristics of a dysfunctional work environment. Occasionally if a rating was very far off of what they were looking for - usually due to a typo or misclick - they would send it back with a warning saying so, but that represented the sum total of feedback given. Personally, I found it very difficult to work with no input about whether they wished I were going faster, whether I was going faster than my peers, whether I was doing a great job, or - most of all - any input about how to improve in general. Sure, it's a year-long temp job, but one which can potentially be repeated after another year has passed - and besides, who doesn't want to receive positive feedback and learn how to improve and receive more? I guess more importantly, who doesn't want to know what the expectations for their work are?? The one saving grace for me was that I found a forum for people working from home where some other folks who were doing temp work for Google could get together and chat a little - without breaking any confidentiality agreements - about what we struggled with, how much we were able to do in a day, and what we thought the expectations for us were, based on all of our experiences. The other major downside was that the temp agency they used, WorkForceLogic, was just TERRIBLE - specifically at handling payroll, which is a terrible thing to be terrible at. There were many times that I didn't get paid, got a bonus deducted from my check instead of added to it, et cetera - and it was always a different mistake from all the ones they had made before, and it always took them a while to figure out what had gone wrong, track down whoever needed to fix it, wait for them to get back from lunch or an appointment or come back to work the next day or.... And they were no better at communication, really; I had hoped that once this assignment was up I would be able to get more assignments through WFL, but no matter how many phone calls I made, nobody could ever figure out who I should be talking to or find anyone who would return calls.","My story is a little different than most others because I was a temp worker for Google, testing search results for a year. I enjoyed the work a great deal; there were always new interesting things to test, and I got to see things like Maps and Timelines long before they were released to the public and help make them better.
