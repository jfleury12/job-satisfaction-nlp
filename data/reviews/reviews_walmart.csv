352,customer host asset protection,2.0,good pay and friendly people,they offer you full time but only schedule you as part time,Walmart
353,not the place for young professionals trying to stand out in tech,5.0,experience scale incentive cross functional teams benefits budget,under paid crazy hours too much top down leadership poor work culture,Walmart
354,walmart assembler,4.0,the best part of the job was the consistent change in tasks. some position require you to do the same thing over and over again which is way to repetitive for me stocking loading and zoning. however in my position i was doing something different each day which kept the job fresh.,the hours were a little all of the place. my schedule would change from nights to days between a matter of days. tough to get into a routine.,Walmart
355,a mostly great job,4.0,the minimum pay for all retail positions in the store is higher than what youre going to find at any other retail or service job in most areas. the work is typically easy but repetitive which should be expected since walmart is a retail bureaucracy. paid 15 minute breaks every 2 hours and a generous hour lunch that is unpaid. in this specific position customer hosts prevent theft by checking receipts and reporting suspicious activity or potential push outs to higher authorities such as salaried management customer service managers or asset protection associates depending on if you enjoy preventing theft or working in a criminal justice related position to an extent this could be a pro or con for you. most people and customers at this specific store are kind but this can change from store to store.,standing for long periods of time endlessly greeting customers and checking receipts for unbagged larger items. most customers hate you and see you asking for receipts as a personal vendetta rather than a job you have to do based on whats sitting out in their cart. this can lead to potentially violent situations if hosts arent careful with how they address customers. many customers who believe they are educated on your position more than you will claim that it is illegal to ask for their receipt this is not true as it is not illegal to ask someone a question. instead it is illegal for a customer host to detain customers who refuse to show receipts but most hosts are taught that this action is not allowed. people see you as personal electric scooter assistant who can magically make a fully charged scooter appear. many customers who need a scooter are extremely rude and refuse to treat you as a human being. management is hit or miss. managers are either very kind and understanding or very rude demanding and selfcentered. depending on your department certain managers are not flexible with hours and will not follow your schedule or fix your schedule if the computer schedules you incorrectly.,Walmart

467,few positive aspects,1.0,large category specialist classes of recent undergrads mean that being there can feel like college p2 if youre into that,where to start.... i decided to take this role after deep disenfranchisement with a previous even lower paying role drove me to make the leap. and for starters i have to give the category specialist program credit for this that title means absolutely nothing to other companies which when transitioning out of walmart can be a positive if youre good at spinning. that said this role is a massive irredeemable poop show. much has been said about the massive workload and how little good training there is and thats all true but people dont point out how many terrible ineffective mind numbing useless trainings css are regularly pulled into the kind of stuff that does absolutely nothing for your performance in the role while sapping away hours you could spend on your actual job. not that your actual job is well defined. recruitment and management totes the program as an opportunity to run a small business within walmart but when higherups casually decide to consolidate categories or eradicate key resources those words ring hollow. this is known by every single person involved in the category program but what distinguishes this role from stupid but bearable to stupid and utterly intolerable is your manager. i had three over the course of my time one insisted that they werent a micromanager while constantly peering over my shoulder and at times going over my head to make changes to my own category another that paid no attention and another who was actually a graduate of the cs program and knew what they were talking about. whether your manager likes you and whether theyre willing to shield you from the bs that upper management demands out of the blue is central to your experience. ive seen highperforming css sacked merely because the manager didnt like them personally. ive seen css speak with their manager about improving their performance coming up with plans to do so and still being fired before they have time to implement anything. managers almost always place optics above true growth much less their teams career development. important side note unlimited pto is almost always a scam but that is especially the case at walmart. there is this blackout period which department heads will try to play up as something fun. in reality it is a three month period at the end of the year where pto is virtually forbidden for all css as pressure to perform on black friday and cyber monday ramps up. yes this applies to categories that do not see spikes in business during the holidays yet theyre paradoxically asked to be there for morale. not only that if your business is seasonal like fans or any patio product congratulations you have two blackout periods. there are categories that arent allowed to take pto for five months of the year. this company is so fickle. you may be talking to a cross functional partner one day about plans for the business and on the next day see that their entire department was dissolved  and not from an internal memo but on the news see hayneedle. you may think walmart is a safe stable company to join especially amidst all of the startups in the bay area but youd be wrong. i know that the labor market can be tough but if you can avoid this company like the plague it does not care about you or your wellbeing.,Walmart

956,employment,3.0,opportunities to advance good training,pay was ok could have been better,Walmart
957,its a job,3.0,they have great insurance. many positions. a discount after three months. paid time off and protected time off. lean dress code.,some of the people are not that great to work withmay differ from store to store. discount does not cover food. they promise raises and than dont deliver. little to no way to move up unless your really like and willing to bend over backwards.,Walmart
958,paid to babysit,3.0,salary is great. you get the chance to meet alot of people from diverse backgrounds.,every manager is afraid to be a leader because you get open doored all the time. hr and the ethics department makes the place horrible. everything you do as a manager is undermined by someone. you do not get to make any decisions the micromanagement is insane. there is no structure and the leadership will just say thank you when they mess up and make you pay for it they will not explain or take your input.,Walmart

965,great place to grow,4.0,everyones like family always room to advance great pay and benefits,their desperate for workers didnt finish my training before being thrown out on the floor had to learn as i went,Walmart
966,i had good experience at walmart,4.0,if youre new to the us and you dont have any work experience thats the good start to working at walmart store and get some money as parttime worker. the manager supervisor and coworkers was so perfect kind and helpful to me.,there are lots of work to do and youre getting tired so the salary doesnt enough.,Walmart
967,management tries,4.0,other staff are friendly and helpful. the csms rock most customers are okay. wish i could award some for their patience in difficult situations. they work around your schedule.,scheduling must be calculated by computer  no human would create the schedules my electronics staff has. i made it clear i knew very little about cell phones and video games but the hiring manager said my core electronics knowledge was what they were looking for. turns out that half the customers that come to electronics deal with cell phone issues. about 13 ask about video gaming. training is awful. there were 30 hours of computer training  basically watching glorified youtube videos. when i was put in front of a register i only knew how to sign in. their system still fails to find my user idpassword several times before letting me in no matter how slow and accurate i am. we are regularly understaffed 2 days a week. it can be difficult finding anybody to ask for assistance on those days. example after 2 days of being out on the floor with very little training i had to work by myself for over 5 hours. even the managers who were there wondered how that happened. the handhelds printers walkies and special electronics keys are always being borrowed by night staff and not returned. weve started locking them up but they still disappear. even on understaffed day one handheld gets shared by the whole department. it isnt stated but its very helpful if you use your own smart phone to do your job. having one should be a requirement. there are a few trouble customers that keep returning. they deliberately make situations difficult for employees and cry for a manager if you sneeze wrong. if you have a wide open schedule theyll bounce you around the clock  worse than doing swing shift. several experienced staff members not management thank goodness are condescending to new staff. they are quick to criticize without knowing the entire situation. one does things his way which is not necessarily the customer comes first walmart way.,Walmart
968,stay alert,3.0,walmart has great benefits such as 401 stocks and profit sharing,management is usually full of young people and although they try hard to express walmart core values they themselves are lacking in maturity,Walmart

972,good environment,5.0,skilled people. successful company. lots of technology.,location. weather. offices. to much rotation of consultants.,Walmart
973,atrocious,1.0,honestly there arent any at this point.,despite being a full time employee full time hours are not given to myself or anyone else. they tell you that they will work with you and provide flexible scheduling but time and again that has proven to not be the case. because the stores are so horribly understaffed people dont get lunches or breaks 70 of the time and there is rampant retaliation despite promising safeguards against it. you are unable to assist customers and do your job because they expect you to do the work of several people by yourself. all in all the company is predatory with a toxic business practice.,Walmart
974,okay,2.0,great pay nice breaks,bad managers treated poorly,Walmart
975,mismanagement in individual stores is horrifying,2.0,theyll hire almost anybody with almost any or no qualifications,after 13 years  starting at 7.50hr my final wage was less than the newly enacted minimum wage for new hires. walmart pinches pennies where it really hurts its imployees.,Walmart

986,build people skills,3.0,kept me inshape walking so much and never a dull moment. you learn to interact with many different personalities and cultures. overall this job help me to understand how to build people up and help them succeed. the tuition discount was very helpful. if you showed interest to move up your leaders were willing to help.,at times you could run into managers that was not supportive. they also had issues at time being too friendly with employees underneath them. the pay was certainly a problem and was not where it should be.,Walmart

990,typical poor employer,1.0,there really arent any pros that i can think of aside from its better than not having a job at all maybe...,no formal training very poor compensation for the work being performed gray area as to who is your manager etc. supplies never get replenished hardly any tools provided to do the jobs properly. ive seen torque wrenches bashed against things to remove a stuck socket etc they cant apply an accurate torque with being abused like that its just common sense. supervisors wont train you yet when you screw up theyll gladly punish you in whatever fashion they can think of. scheduling is extremely poor numerous times i have observed them to not have enough personnel in order to keep the facility open and therefore they close early. tons of room for improvement within this facility. computer system is very out of date and does not work as it should. supply of oil is not replenished regularly and we run out frequently. i cant think of another facility in the area that pays as low as walmart does for this type of work. on top of the incredibly low pay youre badgered by supervisors about things theyve never offered to train you on. almost as if theyre setting up their own people to get rid of them or something. turned down a higher paying job due to my having already told manager that i would accept the walmart job and did not want to leave them hanging. wishing i would have taken the other job now.,Walmart
