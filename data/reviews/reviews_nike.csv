Great benefits and perks.","Game of Thrones is real, and it is called Nike. This company is extremely bureaucratic, with too many hoops to jump through for any decision. If you're not part of the favored group, you're made to less than - Indespensible, of no value on your own, and like you should be happy to just have a job. Over the years it became more of a popularity contest vs spotlighting real talent. Work/life balance is extremely poor.

The managers swear that their employees are #1 to them but we're not.",Nike
21,"""Decent Retail Job""",3.0,Pros are that they do emphasize on bringing premium service to the consumer. Direct deposit every 2 weeks and they pay your training that they refer to as RTC or Rookie Training Camp as well as any training or store meeting which is pretty early hours. You'll love coming to work to see your co-workers and some consumers make your day when you're able to talk to them on slow days. Management can definitely improve on deferring from favoritism and only picking on those who are not. They can also work on having the leads actually contribute to the sales floor and not just micromanage or walking around ordering people to do minimal tasks they're capable of. They're big on receiving feedback referred to as pulse shout outs which are then read out loud the following day so make sure you make an effort to give good service and get recognized by the consumer filling that survey out. They also do tend to use gift cards and food or additions to the break room as incentives to win contests such as being the store that sells the most gift cards during holiday season or who can keep up perfect attendance meaning punch in on time and be on the floor ready on time. This is a great job for students and people who are hesitant on retail because I found this retail job to be less strenuous than what I heard most retail jobs are and a decent pay. You get to say you work for NIKE which is a great accomplishment seeing their applications and interview hiring process is competitive.,"Again, favoritism plays a big role depending on which store you are at. As much as they emphasize on premium service, they are always either out of sizes or don't sell the merchandise consumers come in. You'll get reprimanded by the coaches or leads if you come in with dirty sneakers, not the right uniform or if you're not in the zone you're assigned. Really hard to grow and stand out in retail if you want to grow within the company. Again, it's about favoritism over professionalism in some stores. Seems to be more geared towards sneaker culture and folks who want to use their employee discount to get some new sneakers and less on the sports/athlete environment.",Nike

NIKE is governed by an executive leadership team that has absolutely no idea what is happening on the ground due to the internal censorship. All very bright people but removed from NIKE's reality. Below them is a layer of VPs - my advice for anyone who wants to succeed at NIKE is to focus on making their VP like them, as opposed to simply doing an excellent job. It's an adult's popularity contest essentially. Most employees are miserable at NIKE and while they are investing millions in implementing work aimed at changing the culture, I (along with the many I know still there) can't see this happening. If you are lucky enough to have a good manager NIKE can be great but unfortunately they are few and far between.

Unique sports and health forward environment. Fun company-wide events on the HQ campus.

Employee store discounts and sample sales are very nice.","Cutthroat working environment. (relative to less aggressive companies in the same industry) Just because it is a sports/athletics company, it still functions like a blue-chip capitalist corporate company. Like many companies, promotions are rarely given on merit. HR and the employee relations team is toothless when advocating for employees not in management positions.

This has led to decline in the culture and collective values over time. Very difficult to advance from within and you are paid less then those brought in externally. You may even be paid less than those with lower titles and less experience on the same team because of this. Students from the local colleges are not prioritized but rather bringing in 'talent' from outside the state. Many of these entry roles don't require more than a bachelors so there's a lot of over qualified people for their position. Creates a meat grinder as the real payoff isn't until you're a Director level. Nike is a complicated organization and new managers struggle because of this. Constant planning (deck creation) and dog and pony shows to showcase strategy (really so people can self promote and look sharp). A lot of self-promotion that happens as it's the tried-and-true way to move ahead. Present well, look sharp and glad hand the right people. Creating 'value' and working hard, while constantly emphasized, is not the game here. Perception is king. Highly competitive to advance which creates a 'popularity' contest. A lot of drinking the kool-aid and thus group think. The mid-tier managers all participate in this to survive and advance. Highly stressful in certain positions (health consequences for many). Best areas to work are in design, product, innovation. If you land in a spot with good people (and manager) it can be great.

Management does not spend enough time developing their employees. They claim they ""don't have the time"", but, ultimately, it's a time management and prioritization issue. This is not solely direct management's fault, as their business objectives get more and more complicated every day. Senior and Executive leadership should get more in tune with this. • People (Pro and Con) -- You have the opportunity to work with some incredibly talented and wonderful people at Nike. But watch your back, and be extremely mindful about who you trust and what you say to people. You would be surprised who will throw you under the bus at any chance they get. Best bet is to keep your head down and do what you were hired to do. • Lack of recognition -- If you aren't in the ""in crowd"", good luck getting invited to events, or even being told ""thank you"" for a job well done.

I don't know what went down, but the fact that the company is now going to open up an anonymous hotline for complaints and is promising some soul-searching about the culture there indicates to me that upper management is aware of a company-wide issue -- one that's pervasive, systemic, and stretches far beyond the C-Suite. Good. It's about time. Nike HQ is toxic for women. It has been for a long time. And not in the ways that are easily identifiable -- not everyone is getting Matt Lauer'ed or brushing off lewd comments at an office happy hour. It's far more insidious than that-- and it's not just the entitled, overpaid white men who are responsible. Here are some ways the environment is toxic for women: - Getting ignored, marginalized or talked over when trying to present in a meeting. (The standard-issue white male Senior Director will be checking his phone, trust me). Toxic. - Leaving early to pick up a sick baby at daycare, feeling the resentment of the rest of your team (particularly childless women) following you out the door. Toxic. - Being passed over for promotions as a woman, doomed to tread water in middle-manager-land forever, because you've been deemed either too aggressive or not committed enough because you leave early to pick up said sick baby (see above). Toxic. - Checking your email at 3 a.m. because you're up and dealing with a kid with an ear infection, only to discover a brusque, frustrated note from your boss sent at 11:53 pm asking why you haven't turned in a project yet. Toxic. - Standing around at an office function, watching the lads and bros (all Senior Directors) shmooze with the VP as you stand off with the other women (managers, ""specialists"") and wait your turn to try and make an impression on said VP (white, male, usually British) and hope he remembers your name. Toxic. Look - some of this probably sounds like standard corporate-America griping, and perhaps it is. But having worked for other Fortune 500 companies, I can tell you that the environment at Nike is unique. Politics, backstabbing, strict adherence to hierarchical, patriarchal norms, and frat-boy/lad culture all conspire to make it a fairly awful place for women, particularly moms. The only women I know who ever made it up the ranks (a double-edged sword, as the job will then consume your every waking moment) are the ones who acted like men to get there -- swaggering about, doling out sports-talk, ingratiating themselves with the right people while stepping on others to get up the ladder, and routinely placing work as the highest priority over family time and/or anything else. Of all the painful circumstances of working there, the woman-on-woman warfare was the worst. Women at Nike HQ are forced to squabble, scheme and bully each other to fight for position and influence at a company that gives out precious little of either. Toxic. I'll leave it at that. #TimesUp, Nike, and not a moment too soon.",Nike

The supervisors don't follow up with line worker requests and don't communicate with leads. As a result of this, they end up mixing orders and the lines suffer because of it. Managers will constantly remind line workers to let them know if something is wrong with a machine, and when something is wrong they tell them to just wait and bear with it until a break-time when they are willing to shut off a line to fix it. There are multiple occasions I can remember when someone mentioned something wrong with a part and they told them to wait til break, when the parts gave out the lines ended up going down for 2-6 hours. Supervisors often forget things that they tell people they will do, and as a result the communication is poor. For instance, I was supposed to get reviewed after my first-third-and sixth month of employment so I could see what areas I was doing well in and what areas I could improve on, but I never saw those. Even after asking my supervisor the answer was always, ""yeah we'll get to that soon."" The work is horribly inefficient, and if there are any solutions to speeding up the process that cost anything, the requests will get denied. This and there are plenty of ""quality of life"" changes to the lines that are plain out stupid, a waste of company resources, and a waste of time. There was a day when my line was down and I had nothing to do, so a coworker and I spent 3 hours putting colored duct tape onto a table. This of course was a better alternative to just sitting there, as our line manager told us to not leave the area because we would be up and running soon. To continue on the lack of efficiency, there is also incredible amounts of bias. I hope you don't plan on getting promoted because unless you know the Supervisors personally, you're going to have to work there for a long time to get one. Since promotions are time based, it's only about how long you've worked there, not how good of a worker you are. Along with this, supervisors will promote people for no reason other than the fact that they know them. If you need a job, Air MI is an okay place to work, but ultimately I just wouldn't apply. It's a waste of time, the people you work with have no plans of going anywhere, for a manufacturing location they pay worse than any others in the area, and to top it off management doesn't care about you at all.",Nike

Here are some of the pros for a retail ""athlete"": Pay higher than average retail Tuition assistance for full timers Employee discount Relatively exciting and innovating product Staff dress shoes and apparel twice a year, but if I'm correct this is only discounted at 50% Coworkers are for the most part very friendly","I would say its either A.) a 5-10 year process to break into corporate Nike from retail, or B.) possible for about 1 in every 10,000 Nike employees. There is NO help from current corporate employees on how to get in to Nike's corporate side Pushy on signing customers up for Nike+ Stores obviously vary based on customer base, and management but these factors can make every work day miserable No team bonding for retail athletes, no appreciation for retail athletes, in all honesty I don't think retail employees are even considered when any corporate decisions are made that effect the retail side These opinion are of course just mine, but from a retail athlete perspective I can guarantee that I am not the only one who has these opinions.",Nike

The bikes have been a marked improvement. There is crowding, however, the campus has been going through a tremendous rebuild and expansion and I think it will be alleviated.",Nike
1255,"""Doesn't Utilize Talent and PowerPoint Extreme""",1.0,1. Fitness facilities 2. Work/Life Balance 3. Learning to lead with patients and navigate a political nightmare,"1. Work is not challenging or rewarding. Extremely underutilized based on background and experience. Many employees have the ability to contribute more, many have expressed the desire too and often the answer is to stay within your area and continue operating, the opportunities will come. 2. I have been told multiple times to ""sit and keep my mouth shut"" during a meeting (Female typically in all male meetings). 3. Leadership values ""Thought Leaders"" over ""People Leaders"" – In my experience this has then turned into ""thought only"" conversations taking place only at the senior management level but never includes those that actually DO the work or can operationalize said ""thought"" strategy. Sr. Directors and VPs are more concerned with pruning each other’s feathers and networking with each other, then getting any actual work done. 4. Lack of promotion of female leaders: Often excuse given is that a specific female acts too aggressive and therefore is passed over for promotion (this is when a male counter-part can say the exact same thing but been seen as a strong leader). I see this occur on a weekly basis. 5. General lack of leadership - I have been in my role about 18 months at the Director level and I have yet to have any leadership in regards to my career, focus or vision of my team, etc. even after multiple attempts to meet with many leaders across the organization to seek guidance. 6. ""Nike Knowledge"" (aka time at Nike) is valued above any outside perspective or experience any new employees may bring to the table. 7. Navigating the “Matrix” organization is seen as a badge of honor, not as excuse for not getting work done, that it is. Many large companies have similar matrix type organizations and can move work forward with small teams driving decisions. 8. Over use of Power Point! Every form of communication is put in power point, it is like the computers at Nike have no other applications installed. I was presenting a calendar in one meeting and I was told by the VP “I will look at it when it is in power point”. I looked at him like he had grown two heads, but he was serious. They want to pay someone at my level, a heathy six figure salary, to copy my completely formatted calendar from Excel to PowerPoint. This is my everyday, if you come to work at Nike, you will LIVE in PowerPoint. No one can actually READ anything here (that is presented in a word document), it has to be served up in a beautiful power point that “gets to the point”, complete with graphics and animation.",Nike

If you can land one of the few jobs on campus, the gyms and the classes are world class. If you are a Sr. Manager or above, just avoid being labelled by HR as a ""Liability"" and you'll be able work 4-hour work weeks indefinitely and eventually retire quite wealthy. The rest of the people that work at Nike are wonderful people and could be the best friends you'll make outside of college, however most of them will be exhausted, financially stressed, and stuck in their job under managers who play advanced office politics all day.","Lost culture, over-worked and underpaid staff, and politics run crazy in a company that no longer has to watch the bottom line. When Nike and I parted ways last year after 12 years, NIKE was paying most junior staff peanuts to work extremely hard with little chance of promotion, far from campus in Hillsboro business parks, by capitalizing on ""THIS IS NIKE!"" Only a small minoirty of the ""cool kids"" worked on the actual campus with access to all the facilities and fun. Most worked in business parks further away. I worked in a division of IT where utterly clueless directors and above frequently phoned it in. They'd show up, plot political games, take a two hour lunch, and disappear again to ""meetings"".

Senior staff was all hired from outside the company to do jobs they didn't understand except one Dutch guy that was the most immoral political operator I've ever witnessed. He regularly used HR and ER to turn his enemies into HR ""liabilities"" after which they were unjustly terminated. There's a spacial place in hell for that guy. Most of my friendly coworkers over the years were eventually pushed out of their jobs by politics, the smallest mistake, or because they had a job someone powerful wanted for a friend.",Nike

The CIS leadership had a multi-year plan to mature the security program and they squandered it through a combination of mismanagement and old fashioned incompetence, where form is more important than function. For example, most companies build out processes for how technology will be used, but in CIS it is opposite - technology is purchased without a viable plan for how it will be used. CIS leadership squandered an amazing opportunity to build a top-notch cybersecurity program through bad management hires, political infighting, and a complete lack of any actionable plan to mature the program (beyond a shopping list of technologies they wanted to buy). Instead of maturing the existing processes and getting the new technology working, more tools were purchased... this added to frustrated engineers and analysts, since the CIS leadership focused on checking off boxes on their shopping list of new technologies and not on how the technology was actually being used. This was not always the case, but more often than not the rollouts did not focus on operationalizing the tools beyond go live. This is simply due to poor management and a lack of accountability for making bad operational decisions. It should be no surprise that this is what happens when you hire non-technical people into technology leadership roles. Most disheartening was seeing how the NIKE Maxims were quoted repeatedly as guiding principles within CIS. However, in reality, the CIS leadership team ran in complete opposition – everything was lip service to doing the right thing. On the corporate side, everyone is expected to welcome new or challenging ideas, quickly evolving to new realities, and treat people with respect. Within CIS, the focus is to maintain the status quo and not to rock the boat. If you step out of line, you are listed as a trouble maker by the CIS leadership team. Such a waste. Only take a job there if you want to drink the Kool-Aid and wish to remain blissfully ignorant to following sound security practices.",Nike

It's a good bet when discussing where you work no one will ever ask ""What do they do"" If you are in to sports there is no better place in the world to work. Superstar athletes are treated like employees on campus. We don't bug them for autographs or pictures. They work out side by side with employees in the gym. Jordan during his first retirement played pick up with some of us in the gym and recently Neymar played lunchtime pick up soccer with employees. You will get a chance to see a different side of some of the stars you watch on tv when they are in town. Some days it feels like you are getting paid to go to college. There are so many events and opportunities to volunteer it's easy to lose focus on your job but I can tell you a long time Nike manager will recognize the importance of new folks attending Nike events and volunteering. Yay Thirst Thursday!","Politics are out of control these days; Nike no longer feels like family. It's getting really really big. It's changed a lot with the growth but that's to be expected what's not acceptable is to let Just Do It die under a giant pile of red tape. There are so many new people that we are losing sight of what made the company great. The culture will eventually die of we don't take the time to teach and pass it on to the next generation. Another con eroding the culture is that everyone is not on the original campus. They have started referring to all Nike locations in Beaverton as ""Nike Campus"" trust me there is only one main campus. Some of the buildings outside of main campus are 10 miles away, feel and look nothing like the original campus. If location is important and you are offered a job make sure you ask exactly where you will be working. If HR tells you eventually we will all be on campus that's not gong to happen. The first campus expansion didn't make room for everyone and this one in process will be no different. These are just a few things to keep in mind.

They push Nike's culture and values to no end, and while Nike's core values are a good foundation for both a company and in general, management treats it mostly as BS to help their store's bottom line. I understand it is a business but the point of shopping directly at Nike is not just for premium product and selection but also for premium service. They tell us to cater to the athlete's needs but only if that means hassling them to needlessly add on to their purchase - that creates a consumer experience no different than shopping at a commission-based store such as Foot Locker and Finish Line. On the point of management playing favorites, if you are new in the store, get ready to get shafted on hours and responsibilities. You'll constantly be given unfavorable shifts and have to pick up the slack of the ""veterans"". Have an emergency and need to call off? Be prepared to be given a dirty look for the duration of the next shift you work, possibly even after that. I realize it is a high-volume retail store but work-life balance is close to non existent here, probably because since management loves to be in the store all day anyway, you should too.

Most employees are drinking gallons of Kool Aid and buy into the brand hype more than Nike consumers do. You'll often hear employees say ""working for Nike has been a life long dream"" of theirs. This is a huge blindspot-- nobody wants to say anything negative, about anything or anyone, ever. It's all cheerleading and roses, and everyone feels lucky just to be there. The power of the brand is also their achilles heel. I love the brand too, but Nike has worst corporate culture I've ever encountered, at any company. No accountability anywhere. Seniority always trumps talent. Everyone talks a big game about teamwork, but it's every man for himself, all the way up the ladder as far as I could tell. Zero investment in developing their people-- no HR presence anywhere. Got a rotten manager? Abusive colleague? Too bad, there's nobody to help you. I never even had an HR person in my division. Giant high school popularity contest, zero meritocracy. Multiple groups with the same assignments and charter will work in silos for months, even years, without knowing about each other. When they find out about each other, it devolves into Game of Thrones/Hunger Games. Back stabbing, idea stealing, and double-crossing are all common practice in these scenarios; I saw it at very high levels of the company, too. It's a flat out organizational disaster with a flaky day-to-day culture: show up late (or not at all) to meetings, everything gets a green light/thumbs up face to face but nobody backs up their word when it comes to budgeting or anything else that requires an actual commitment. Senior leadership stays loyal to terrible under-performers who are allowed to waste millions of dollars and ruin multiple careers beneath them because they've ""been at Nike since the early days."" I personally worked inside a gigantic ""bozo explosion"" that worked exactly the way Jobs described it: B players hiring C players hiring D and F players, all the way down the line. These same clowns then 'fail up' into positions of higher and higher salary with less and less accountability because nobody wants to have tough conversations or real talk. Basically it's a giant playground run by the children who keep their friends in cushy, undeserved roles while great talent is squandered beneath them and eventually leaves for other companies. And no, I'm not generalizing my own path-- in my first 2 years I watch a list of all-stars quit in disgust. Nike didn't care. They didn't even bother with exit interviews.

Skills and experience are not important but ""gamesmanship"" is a must and critical. If you are skilled at your profession the internal Nike lifers will soon destroy your career. Skills, experience, and brains are not wanted. It's a bully and toxic work environment. Personally, if I have known better, I would not have made this a career choice. It is easy to get caught up in the Nike Hype and romance of the Nike brand but the employment culture is extremely toxic. If you are minority (race and gender), this is not the place. This is a culture dominated by Caucasians. If you're over 40s, your career is frozen and they will discretely target you for ""removal"". If you're over 50s, stay where you are. One of the tactics to push people out include: Asked the targeted team to a meeting and then split them into different conference rooms. Voila, laid them off. Nike Golf is a great example of how they ""value"" employees. Nike made a public announcement they will terminate making Nike Golf equipment and only keep the sports apparel. The next morning, employees were told to go to a conference room. If your name was on a white board, you were to collect your severance and shown the door. (Cold hearted!) If you want to see the talent-exit do your search on LinkedIn. Set your search criteria from 2013 - Present. Look for yourself at all the well known experts who have ""suddenly"" left Nike. Unless you have over 15-years of employment with Nike, you will soon find yourself unemployed. Contractors: They treat contractors as strangers on the street; cold and ruthless. The only difference is you can walk into building and have a desk to work on your assignment. You have no place to recommend or suggest anything.

This was to support a huge iniative to bring innovation, advancement and a ""fresh"" culture into Nike IT. With this big push (e.g., Blackhat, etc.) they attempted to hire in external experts and did a good job - initially. However, Nike over promised and under delivered on all their verbal promises during the employment phases. Results: You would think that if the ""Nike Lifers"" couldn't deliver in 25yrs yet the external experts delivered in two the Board of Directors would take note. This group of individuals not only changed the entire company (IT) around, they fixed a multitude of contractual, vendor relationships, IT production and IT security problems - that existed for decades! With such a dramatic and noticeable turn around in 2-3 yrs (vs. 25yrs) you would think the Nike board would praise and promote the external experts. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Nike Lifers have targeted all the external talent and are gradually removing them from employment. Internal efforts revolved around slander, defamation, creating mock-turmoil, etc. Recruiters: External recruiters fully admit to hire someone at Nike, in the IT field, is a ""daunting task"". Nike does not have a good reputation and they savage industry experts. Personal Note: This was one of the worse career decisions I have ever made for me and my family. I was told I could promote change, make a difference that there was nothing here ""a blank slate"" - which was very true. But once I started to innovate and make change the ""Lifers-fangs"" came out and the internal battle lines were drawn. I lost and so did my family. I wish someone would have wrote this on GD before I got employed. Be warned!!!!! In summary: - Nike lifers are threatened by outsiders - If you are over 40yrs old forget long term employment - IT Salary is below industry standards - Few people of color are actually employed at Nike (especially in executive positions) - Very high tech talent turn over rate w/in technology divisions - Senior Managers in IT are non-technical bureaucrats - Little (internal) career advancement opportunities for IT Pros - No outside career enrichment opportunities (e.g., training, speaking engagements, etc.) - Do not adhere to the Nike's ""11 Maxims"" (e.g., Evolve Immediately, Do the Right Thing, Simplify and Go, etc.) - Beware of the ""Dutch Mafia"" (Dutch hired in the '90s have evolved into an interconnected political powerhouse that protect each other. They will commit ""career-assassinations"" against anyone and all outsiders regardless of expertise to protect themselves and their jobs.) - Management retribution is common-place",Nike

The company gives hours based on traffic, and the shipping and receiving area hours are allocated on product flow, regardless of sales. The stores are allowed to make business decisions based on experience rather than top down micro-management. The pay is good for retail. It feels like retail from when I first started before MBA's started to tell the stores to do more with less. Because of this we can really give a customer service experience to the consumer. In today's multi-channel retail streams it is important to give an experience, and not just product, and Nike retail allows for exactly that. There are opportunities for growth if you go after them.","There are still the normal retail headaches like getting the right product at the right time. If you aren't invested in the brand you likely aren't going to like the job. The workload is high, but with a motivated team it is possible. You have to be willing to work hard.

You can pay your contractors more when you are such a huge company, and have incredibly talented contractors doing amazing work for you. The salaries can be offensive. 3. Management - I witnessed a manager in another department that shared my same building who had made multiple young women feel uncomfortable, cry, verbally abuse them and made them quit. I was told that this issue was taken to the VP who did nothing, and the company let this person stay in a management position after numerous complaints. The recruiting agency even had to pull contractors from this department due to complaints - yet the manager got PROMOTED! Disgraceful. 4.

I've been paid less at other retail stores, but I also hear of many employers paying quite a bit more. Their blackout days (No request off periods) are outrageously long, and its during the most inconvenient times. Many people take vacations right before the summer ends, and that is impossible unless you call off for your shifts. They hire seasonal employees and give them so many hours, and leave their committed employees with the left overs, many of us make them aware we want the hours but we still don't get them. We have mad many people transfer to our store from other stores, and they all loved working at Nike... until they came to our store. A few of the managers are power hungry and have favorites. Which alienates many and the quit. Turn over rate is crazy high. I would not recommend this job to someone who is looking for advancement opportunities. OR AS A FIRST TIME JOB, They stand for so many great things and they ""expect"" a lot out of their employees, but they don't stand by what they say, and there is no structure.

Nike likes to let you know when you are hired that they offer a competitive rate..... competitive meaning like 5 cents more than minimum wage. To do well at Nike you have to have passion for the company. Although no one will ever come out and say this directly, those who are purchasing new Nike product tend to do well. However unless you have a lot of extra income coming from somewhere else this is not possible to do with the wage that Nike offers. Nike expects its athletes to BE INCREDIBLE on the floor.

Although the management wants you to succeed and move up, I have had 5 different core coaches in the past 2+ years I've been working here and have had to begin a new relationship / prove my work ethic with new managers constantly which has turned my interest away from staying and moving up. Many of the new managers are also hired outside of the store and company as opposed to within like they encourage. Most of my co-workers who have worked hard for the same store for 4+ years have either quit or moved on because of the lack of opportunities. Additionally, they stress communication greatly but because there are so many employees and managers, standards for the store do not get communicated clearly to everyone.

While a book should not be judged by its cover, many people are unlikely to read it if the cover is not inviting. - anonymous That being said, this is my opinion and impression of Nike IHM (Beaverton) while working there for a couple of months. With all due respect to the General Manager at Nike IHM, Brett Gantz. For the short duration, I've encountered Brett Gantz an outstanding General Manager who cares very much of his employees and Nike company. There are a few supervisors and PMOs have great potential on day shift (D1). Unfortunately, the other 99% offset the rest. First of all, not once received any kind of welcome and/or kindly greeting. That sets a negative environment to any newcomers. I've never experienced from any other company that showed lack of cordiality and hospitableness towards an employee. Second, lack of communication and teamwork from co-workers within the cell. It's all about secrecy, whispering, and/or ""tattle-tale"" one another to gain browning points form either immediate supervisors or PMOs. Third, unnecessary and unprepared meetings from a specific PMO with no skilled facilitation and clarity. In general, meeting purposes are clear, participants are prepared, conversation is dynamic, and the meeting ends promptly, with next steps defined and confirmed among all participants. The meeting may be pleasant, and even fun, and there may exist an enjoyable camaraderie amongst participants. But the meeting is clearly about moving forward the work of the day and is energized by the preparation and clear-focus of its participants. In closure, for a striving and well-organized giant business, Nike IHM have a long tedious road ahead of them to improve their quality of employees. However, this doesn't reflected any negative reviews towards Nike IHM employees at St. Charles, MO. What I've noticed and observed during their short visit to Beaverton, they showed their professionalism and quality that Nike can offer. They have my respect!",Nike
