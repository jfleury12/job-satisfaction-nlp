There's a few jobs that senior employees can do outside of Corp HQ but those opportunities are only provided a few select key males.

10,"""Good start""",5.0,"Compensation packages are exceptional. Base salaries may not be on par with Google, but additional benefits add up fast. Bonuses are usually 10% and often better, up to 25% of base. Stock options (Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs) are awarded twice a year (the target varies, but so long as the company is doing well, the target is usually exceeded). The company offers a dollar-for-dollar match on 401k contributions worth up to 6% of your base salary, which is outrageously high for the private sector. And on top of that, P66 has the white rhino of private sector benefits: a pension, and it vests after just 3 years at the company. Additionally, that pension plan includes more stock options, called ""Success Shares"" that are dropped into your retirement account based on the overall performance of the business. Altogether, these financial benefits can easily be valued at 50% of your base salary, and the longer you stay, the better it gets. With the exception of refineries in New Jersey and California, most offices and facilities are in relatively low-tax, low-cost-of-living locations (especially HQ in Texas, a state with no personal income tax). Since the company is situated in the ""midstream"" (pipelines) and ""downstream"" (refineries, retail) segments of the energy industry, its stock price isn't heavily dependent on the price of oil; it's a company that takes oil &amp; gas in, and then sends it back out as a new product, taking a relatively consistent margin all the time. This protects the firm's value - and therefore the value of your RSUs - against most market volatility. Yes, the company loves to talk up its employee-centric culture. But they back that up by comping people fairly well. It's the kind of chatter that I've heard before at other places, but it always sounded hollow when your sole benefit was something like a 2% match on 401k.","Limited vacation time (usually 10 days), but the company does have 10 dedicated holidays (Christmas, etc). Also, some jobs are eligible for the ""19/30"" program, which gives you an extra day off each moth so long as you work 8.5 hours per day (instead of 8 - up to you if you'd want to do that in any given month).",Phillips 66

It’s going to be the way it’s always been because of legacy managers that are holding onto the 1980s and have a closed mind. The technicians are supposed to work alone, keep things running by whatever means needed, but have zero technical support. There’s no room for a department in the hierarchy with creative technical minds. If it isn’t pipe fittings and welding they don’t think it matters. In the world we live in now, there are so many wonderful technologies we could enable in our processes but you’ll never see them because of ignorant minds at the top. I heard at one town hall about how they are going to enable “predictive maintenance “ by monitoring machine hours and vibrate monitoring. They talked about it like they just invented it and it’s the best thing ever. It’s last decades technology! But they theoretically patted themselves on the back for discovering a steam engine for crying out loud. It’s frustrating beyond belief. This “Digital transformation” they brag about is just another smoke and mirrors show with clever imagery and graphics. They half heartedly designed some apps for an iPad they sent everyone and after a couple years, none of it works worth a flip. They’ll brag about it but it’s an absolute disaster. Most everyone’s iPads are in a desk drawer. They also tell you there are all kinds of cool opportunities to be involved in but the thing is once those projects get underway you won’t be allowed to be a part of it because they run staffing so thin they just can’t allow you to go anywhere.

For one we are a union facility which has bred a culture of Us vs. Them. Conspiracy theories regarding the company's seemingly nefarious actions towards represented workers makes interpersonal work relationships difficult. New jobs and responsibilities with little on-boarding or training is commonplace. Because the Refinery Leadership Team is constantly changing we struggle with creating a sense of ""self"" or culture. The butt of the joke is the people whom we should respect as the leaders are considered nothing more than ""short-timers"" who have neither a sense of the field nor care about the people who work there every day. On a more personal level, supervisors tend to be micro-managers, possibly because they are trying to prove they are worth their pay. I am constantly being asked to update at least 3 different priority spreadsheets/word documents/databases to track my progress on responsibilites. Meanwhile, real progress is hindered. Do not expect to spend much time at home. Depending on your department you will be on-call all week including weekends about once every 2 months or more frequently. No drinking whatsoever during this time. You might consider this a small sacrifice, but when your group is running lean and you have a social life it can be frustrating. Even during normal work weeks the work/life is a little off. My boss will text me during off hours about trivial things. Again, that is probably not a P66 exclusive issue but it remains a product of the demanding work expectation. We have recently revamped our goal setting process to a more complex system (facepalm) that now asks us to post action items and track progress(again with the tracking!).

412,"""Humber Refinery Shift Operations""",2.0,Good benefits package when compared with local area and non petro-chem' / heavy industry type employers.,"Benefits package has been significantly de-valued in real terms over recent years. Operations shift staffing levels always at minimum, significant amounts of extra hours expected to be worked at the drop of a hat to cover sickness, holidays and training needs due to minimum staffing levels, often making a working week 84 hours of 12 hour shifts , the final 5 (going into 2 days off) being 12 hour nights. Working week is 40 hours, not the usual 37 hr average now recognised by most employers. Square pegs often expected to fit into round holes. Training is often rushed due to low staffing levels, as long as the trainee knows the answer to the question on the competency sheet they are deemed competent to operate a refinery. Staff who say the right thing to the right people are promoted, not the staff with the most experience or ability. The company has a great business philosophy / charter but it is significantly lost and followed less and less the lower you get within the business, shift operations are at the bottom. The new buildings at Humber make a great impact to visitors and staff who work in them but once you go out onto site the environment including offices and welfare facilities are very dated, often filthy and badly maintained.

Extremely little opportunity for progression unless you're in higher positions or on the graduate scheme. No autonomy encouraged. US owned and extremely regulated.

Closing the Warwick office will alleviate some of these issues as the deadwood are forced to leave but how long before the same happens at the Humber and London offices?

429,"""Not a bad company to work for""",3.0,"Worked with the company for about 5 years. Working safely is emphasized every day and everyone is expected to watch out for themselves and others. Pay is on par with the rest of the industry with a competitive bonus program, retirement plans, and medical plans. The work is generally interesting and adds real value to the business unit and the company. Lots of opportunities to change positions and continue developing as an individual and professional. Most of the people I've worked with are friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to work together. The company seems well positioned within the industry. The assets are well diversified; they are located throughout the world and balance each other. When one section of the company underperforms, other sections sustain company performance (i.e. compare the 2013 3rdQ results with the 2012 3rdQ results). The CEO consistently recognizes the importance of P66 employees. He looks to be leading the company towards future success, even as he praises the current successes. He seems friendly and down-to-earth. I'm happy and proud to be a part of this organization.","Unfortunately, there are a lot of unpleasant aspects too. The company and management emphasize safe work, but don't always address root causes. An investigation team may identify systemic gaps and recommend specific ways to improve, but management will often disproportionately assign responsibility to an individual. This has led to reoccurance of similar incidents and the same facility as well as throughout the company. Company standards are poorly written (i.e. LOPA) and conflict with the very regulations they are ""based"" on. When senior management is informed of this discrepancy by an 3rd party expert, the response is ""well I'm going to follow the company standard."" Along those lines, management seems to have more emphasis on meeting metrics than actually doing what's right. The implied message is ""I care more about my career than I do about what's right."" At the same time, I've always felt safe walking around the facilities I've worked at. It's just a shame the company is so slow to learn from it's mistakes. Company does not clearly link promotion criteria with performance and managers do not evn know the promotion criteria. There are documented qualifications a salaried employee must meet for promotion (i.e. years of experience, performance history, organizational impact, etc). Managers have regularly misquoted the qualifications. Employees may have exemplary performance, but are not promoted in a timely manner. Some employees have been told ""yes, you meet the criteria but we have a metric to meet so we can't promote you until someone retires or resigns."" Company generally does not offer alternative work schedules (i.e. 9/80s). Some locations have grandfathered flex schedules, but the rest do not and will not. One of the members on the executive leadership team is blatantly against flex schedules ('you already work &gt;9 hrs per day, but for 5 days a week, so why would I give you a free day off?'). And management wonders why employees leave the company and how to retain talent...it's unfortunate really. Truly, one individual on the executive leadership team sees people as tools who can be worked as hard as he wants without any additional compensation. Opportunities to change positions exist because of high turnover in the organization. People (particularly those in the 3-10 yr experience range) are leaving the company for competitors that offer better benefits, i.e. higher pay and flex schedules. Management at facilities with high turnover refuse to let employees relocate because the facility already can't retain employees. Those employees then leave the company. Headcount is definitely an issue. The staffing levels at many facilities are significantly lower than the levels at similar companies. When people leave P66, they generally go to those other companies. Development is almost entirely self-driven. The company offers very little formal training to help employees grow. At least the company is changing that. New training programs have already been implemented and more are being developed. The company really is a decent place to work. If management paid less attention to their careers and more attention to making improvements, the company consistently and clearly linked promotion and performance, and implement flex schedules, P66 would be an outstanding place to work.",Phillips 66
