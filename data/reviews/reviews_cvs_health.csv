2,CVS Health,"Work hours were excessive. To be successful hours worked were borderline slavery. While I willingly worked them to be successful, the week you didn't you were immediately behind. Vacations were almost non existent due to constant visitors from corporate stopping in to do reviews. Holiday weeks were paid 4 days regular 1 holiday and you worked all 5. The facade of the stores looking great when these people stop by versus the reality of the business is polarizing. There were always teams of people and excessive expenditures of payroll thrown into stores prior to their visits. While I understood the need to make an appearance, it was always will always be a backwards way off thinking. Company preaches quality of life for their clients while quality of life for their employees is non-existent. As a ""manager"" in your average store you will be ""managing"" a total of one person during your shift, with a total of 10 people at location. Location open hours will exceed total payroll hours ie Sun-Sat 7am-10pm = 15hrs per day x 7 days x 2 people = 210 hrs which excludes the need to have a person unload deliveries that come in during non opened hours. Your budgeted hours will be approximately 208 hrs. I will only mention that during the month of December that there are extended hours for the stores but no budgeted hours to accommodate. Stores are held to strict shrink targets with little to no control over external theft. Remember 2 people at location, if four people enter to steal there is nothing you can do to stop them. These are facts not personal prejudices.","I learned a lot working there as far as how to run a business as well as how to develop a team. I had one of the most successful teams in the company ranking as the top store year over year in two separate markets, one in the Northeast one in the Southeast.

If you want your 30h a week better have signed off on the waiver cause the My Schedule will always take it out. And with payroll being tight you will have to lose that if you want a lunch. -so many new systems they bring out like the care pass and the old curbside. They use to get on us for email collections before the app came out. Like not everyone wants to give out their email or have a burner one to use. -to many tasks need to be done in a day for a two man team up front in what is deemed a low volume store. Very few days can everything ever get done and thats if not only front is slow but also RX. Many times while being a manager on would be called back to RX to ring cause they are behind thus leaving a new person up front not knowing what to do after what task I can give them is finished. Or the front is very busy where it would almost need a 3rd person on cause nothing else is getting done out on the sales floor. Add in asking a million questions to a customer for extra addons every time corporate wants to bring them out. No wonder there are states that are in trouble with the FDA for expired items. We NEVER have enough time to get what needs to be done in a day finished and then go out and check the outdates on items that need it. -Speaking out outdates my state is one that is in trouble for that. Customers come in and scour the store for outdates and sadly cause we dont have enough time they find the ones that are just up by a day or two. And its not one coupon for finding the stuff.

258,CVS Health,"I'd like to start by saying that I am generally a very happy and optimistic guy. I don't like to complain, but this needs to be heard. Once upon a time, in a land where expectations were realistic and people were given adequate time to do their jobs, CVS was a good company to work for. But then!... The NY Times published an article on 1/31/2020 about chaos at retail pharmacies and pharmacists' very real fear of misfilling prescriptions. The reason is there is far too much to do and far too little time given to get it done. The risk is obviously different working in the front store, but the point is that there is nowhere near enough time to do our jobs correctly, and we are micromanaged to no end. Salaried employees receive zero compensation for working what are oftentimes countless hours beyond what they actually get paid for. The hiring process is a disaster. It takes weeks, if not months, to get a new hire actually working at our store. Staffing issues have plagued many of the twenty-or-so local stores with which I am familiar. Unless one knows how to manipulate the time-space continuum, we are forced to cut corners and half-ass our work. It's just a crazy juggling act. I honestly believe that the only way to fully complete the workload correctly is to have a staff solely consisting of experienced, fast-moving, super hard-working people. Needless to say, those odds are rare. We went from having basically unlimited ability to satisfy our customers to a having a ridiculously strict computer system that impedes good service at the register. Most, if not all, of the technology is under par, for that matter. We're constantly pressured to sell a subscription program when none of us signed up to be a salesperson. The incentive is laughable. I don't know the actual turnover rate, but it seems quite high, including field management. Not surprising when the company treats its employees as expendable. I could go on and on... But seriously, look elsewhere. In the end, you reap what you sow. Good luck, CVS!","I've met some amazing people working for CVS, including my fiance.

369,CVS Health,"I think there are limited (no) opportunities to move from the store level, to corporate (in any capacity). It appeared to be quite elusive to make a transition, unless you had dedicated over a decade of your life to the company. Additional comment: Upper management intentionally under-budgets the hours needed to run the store, which leads to an almost impossible workload if you have lazy supporting staff. Overtime is essentially required to perform basic store tasks for supervisors/managers (the ones who generally feel a stronger obligation to meet expectations), which in turn leads to overtime. Overtime is frowned upon. It's also very difficult to fire staff members who don't pull their weight due to the unions regulations. Some staff members really know how to use Unions to their advantage. Good for the staffer, not good for the company as a whole. I think management should document more obvious infractions to ensure we staff quality members. Example of the bade: Like those who brag about calling in sick for a concert, or sleep in the break room to avoid working during their shift. I work in a total of 4 stores, and was very surprised on how certain behaviors were tolerated/normalized by management.","Staff sizes at each store are also generally small, so you become real friends with coworkers. You can just about always count on someone to cover your shifts, if you are willing to do the same for them. Basically, be a good team member, and you will be met with flexibility &amp; understanding. I mention this because it is very doable to take multiple vacations/personal time, even as a supervisor/manager, as long as you are efficient as scheduling everyone's hours. Plan ahead! This will lead to a healthy work-life balance. You also get to know regular customers pretty well, so it's best if you are open to engaging with every one that walks in.

They refuse to make the necessary changes to drag themselves up to even the last 10 years in technology. The organization's leadership has no grasp of work/life balance. They go from 70+ hour weeks with 24 hour support and 7 day work weeks as far as the eye can see, burning everyone out to the point of quitting, all due to their stunning mismanagement and horrible or non-existent planning. From that, all the way to shutting down nearly every project mid flight at the end of August, because they ran out of money three to four months before the end of the year forcing layoffs of full time employees.

795,CVS Health,"As a pharmacist you can’t find a more humiliating place to work. I used to have better control over my day. Corporate stopped putting pharmacist in charge and began replacing them with businessmen. And yes I mean men. My boss is so misogynistic and has made all the women feel uncomfortable. Has anyone brought it up to HR ? No, because of a fear of retaliation. It can be retaliation that comes in the form of denied time off, relocation to another store, something subtle enough where you know you’re being punished. When I call out sick I was told I didn’t give them enough notice so I was asked to come in and they would try and find me coverage. Halfway through the day I have to call, hoping they found someone. They always say they tried but no luck. So I just do the entire day. They told us they’re not doing bonuses anymore because we’re being paid too much. We should be happy with our reasonable pay. We are asked to do so much. You can work a 13 hour day and it still wouldn’t be enough time to keep up with your work. Our job is to counsel and check proper filling of medication. With that, we have the other tasks like inventory, scheduling, training, request refills from doctors, and regulatory. All of that gets pushed aside when corporate asks us to make 70 calls in the middle of the work day. They want us making sure the techs are making their phone calls too. These are such unwanted and bothersome phone calls that are the exact definition of telemarketing. They are actually called “patient care calls”. People get annoyed and develop low opinions of the company. We are then told to push flu shots on people. I wish that was an exaggeration. This week our goal is 205 flu shots. We don’t have the extra staff to accomplish this. 205 weekly shots are 30 shots per day. When we don’t reach this goal we are told we are bad pharmacists. Meanwhile we get desperate toward the end of the week when this quota isn’t met. We ask patients to bring their friends in. We ask if we can go into their workplace, schools, and places of worship to do this. None of us are as inefficient as they make us out to be. We work so so hard. You have techs that make close to nothing so we constantly are losing help. When techs find other jobs, they will leave if you’re lucky. Sometimes they tell their other tech friends to join the job with them. You’re then left with no staff. You cannot give them raises to stay. They really have no incentive. I honestly feel bad for them. Some of them struggle when this is their full time job to make ends meet. CVS also has a backwards SLOW system that crashes constantly. You would call IT for assistance and they tell you that your equipment would have to be restarted. That is ALL the assistance you’d get. It’s too bad every single equipment takes 10 minutes to restart. That another 10 minutes added to a sick person’s waiting time. So when the customer puts in this complaint. We are told we are making excuses for poor customer service. We can only work with with what we have. We have people who can work at top speed but get slowed down by our machines. Our “updates” will crash the system at a moments notice, leaving angry customers to go elsewhere. After the crash is over all you got out of that update is slower speed and better graphics. No point in that whatsoever. Our registers have our cashiers look up patients on a touch screen. It’s almost comical how many glitches there are. Because of a fear of complaints you have to be completely responsive to people who ask for the pharmacist. They will demand one over the phone and in person. It’s not like a doctors office where you have to wait to speak to one. You have to walk over as soon as they ask for one. This constant interruption leads to dangerous medical errors. And every pharmacist at cvs has been accused of these type of mistakes. We are reprimanded by corporate and told to do our job better. We told that these interruptions are “excuses”. Most of the patients who ask for a pharmacist don’t even need our help. They just need to be shown where something is, attention, refills, a platform for complaints, feedback on “my” pharmacy, etc. I was once told at the consultation counter to throw our someone’s garbage. When I said there’s a garbage in our bathroom she insisted that I take her coffee cup and banana peel because she doesn’t have time to search for a garbage. So we literally and figuratively takes all kinds of people’s garbage. Because I don’t want to deal with complaints I address all of these concerns. It leaves me no time to fill medication and no time to double check my work. Forget about time to see if the medication is dosed correctly. You’re going to have to hope the doctor made the right choice. When we have sufficient staff we are told we are over staffed. We get in trouble for that. My last point is a well known fact. Pharmacists for cvs do not get time to eat lunch. We are all strung out on coffee and caffeinated beverages. We are on our feet with no time to sit down.",I regularly have four days off in a row.

840,CVS Health,"Oh boy. Where to start. CVS bought Aetna and gave employees raises. Sounds great. It’s not. They cut our hours so drastically that I literally make less now then when I did with lower hourly pay. Schedule optimization is a joke. They cut hours so far back that each full time employee at our store literally only has 30 hours a week. That is the bare minimum to keep benefits and still be classified as full time. In the pharmacy, we have so many metrics to abide by that we can’t even keep up and then corporate gets mad that we can’t hit flu shot goals. Everything is just a number to them. They say they care about customers but they don’t. At all. If they did, they would make sure that technicians have enough hours to actually work. Having only 30 hours a week and STILL having to work 5 or 6 days a week leaves absolutely no work/life balance. Most days, my store is lucky I even show up. I probably actually work about 40 hours per week because I have to stay off the clock to get all the inventory stuff done each week. And that’s another thing.

861,CVS Health,"CVS is one of the lowest paying corporations and they recently gave everyone a raise due to the union demanding an increase in payment. That is astounding as they claim they are the 2nd largest store of its kind. Walgreens being their main competitor. A lot of my coworkers not in management were on food stamps and medicaid. Everyone not in a management position did not have full-time work. As full time work would allow the employees to apply for insurance etc. So not only are they screwed out of insurance, they are also screwed out of a decent pay. My store was high volume, and always understaffed. Which turns out to mean longer wait times for customers and impossible workloads for employees. Customers were always waiting in line. Which of course they will be on a skeleton crew. After the customer has been aggravated by standing in line, at checkout there is a bunch of questions. Do you have a CVS card, Would you like to update your email, would you like to receive text messages, are you interested in a care pass card etc?Of course the frustration is taken out on the employee instead of higher ups who make those rules for transactions. Please just let customers have a simple transaction and leave out the store without having to answer a billion questions. It's unfair to the customer. Theft was pretty high as well, as if you are short staffed, you do not have enough employees to watch for it. The main reason I quit and refuse to shop there is, their practices towards their employees. Not only is CVS one of the more expensive stores to get items from they pay their employees low, refuse to give medical insurance which in turns cost the tax payers more money as OUR taxes are impacted by the communities needing food and medical assistance from the government. Which could easily be remedied, by paying people a living wage. I refuse to support businesses like this as they screw you over in more ways than one The work/life balance is terrible. Instead of providing employees with full days of work, you would be expected to work 4hours here and 6 hours there. If you are going to schedule someone for a 20 hour shift 2.5 days should cover it. There is no reason someone should be working 4-6 days for that shift time.

I was hired on as a part time pharmacy technician. After a few months, everyone else at my store had either transferred or quit. That in itself should have been a red flag as nobody was satisfied enough to stay. Although we had help come in from nearby stores, I was the only technician that was actually employed there. You’d think that, given the fact that I’d given up the position I had elsewhere to be there for twelve hour days almost every single day for the better part of a year, they’d switch me over to full-time status so I could get some insurance, right? NOPE. I spent a lot of time begging higher ups to figure this out. It took several phone calls threatening legal action in order for me to get switched to full time, and by then not only was it too late for me to want to stay, but I wasn’t even informed about it until I received a paycheck with healthcare deducted from it— I never even signed up for healthcare and was not told what I was getting regarding benefits. Techs and pharmacists worked ourselves to the bone for little to no thanks from higher ups. Rarely got breaks, then got penalized for not taking breaks. Patients frequently threatened violence and made racist remarks; nothing was done about this. Emphasis on metrics over patient care leads to mistakes that could jeopardize the health of patients. And the phone saying “one pharmacy call!” instead of simply ringing is the worst invention in the entire universe.
