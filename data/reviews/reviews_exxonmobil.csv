10,worst company i have ever worked at,1.0,nothing good really a typical big and old company with last generation people. some good nice coworkers but would pretend they didnt know you after you leave.,wicked culture will tell youwe want you to stay and hire another coworker then lay you off. then you would finally connect the dots for all the things they had done. incredibly ignorant and think oil and gas will be in the lead forever. they think they are the best and different in design product and business. but the coal industry once thought they were different look at them now. and look at the speed of the ev industry. the world might still need the oil in the next 30 years but its still not the future.,Exxon Mobil
11,great company,4.0,great benefits great work life balance. great coworkers.,there are no cons in which im aware.,Exxon Mobil
12,racist company,1.0,pay is very good. lots of ot,they dont hire blacks or hispanics. good ole boy system,Exxon Mobil
13,great place to work,4.0,good people who mostly seem happy to work here high safety focus to make sure injuries are not a common occurrence plenty of mobility options and growth opportunity lots of paid training opportunities great pay and benefits,large company bureaucracy makes it difficult to complete work sometimes expect a lot of their engineers which can lead to over worked long hours somewhat randomundefined career paths most plant locations are in undesirable cities,Exxon Mobil
14,i wish someone had told me...,1.0,salary thats all i can say,micro management bullying you cant apply for the next job when you are ready they rank you and pit you against each other managements bad behaviors are not only tolerated but defended. its the worst decision i ever made to accept a job here. i wish someone had told me all of this before i relocated for this nightmare.,Exxon Mobil
15,i enjoyed my job there and was sad to leave.,4.0,i enjoyed this job. i had to leave because i moved.,i worked hard to organize things but it didnt seem like they wanted organization.,Exxon Mobil
16,i experienced a great work environment  varies across the entire company,5.0,great worklife balance highly intelligent and friendly coworkers great pay,somewhat oldfashioned as a company and obsessed with strict processes. i have had only great experiences but have heard of others having negative experiences. luckily you move around a lot from team to team so if you have issues with a given supervisor you will not work with himher for long,Exxon Mobil
17,exxonmobil,5.0,great people challenging work wonderful salary and benefits,internal politics can be disruptive,Exxon Mobil
18,good for learning but slow moving and stale,4.0,pay is great and management is flexible and understands families,work is stale and not very impactful.,Exxon Mobil
19,reflection of experience,2.0,stability pay company continues to expand retirement optionsui,work life balance is obsolete. trainingdevelopment for employees is lacking structure. work environment. lack of innovation in multiple departments.,Exxon Mobil
20,not for everyone aka only for risk adverse engineers,1.0,virtually unlimited ammo  to execute. resilient group of people during crisis. basically impossible to be fired. yearly salary increase. fat pension if you resist,to experienced hires dont apply. the rating system is built so that only who starts after college can advance in their career. the atmosphere is mostly passive aggressive with a sprinkle of backstabbing. the companys vision is fast follower basically if you have ideas go elsewhere. everything is a project and the bureaucracy is unbelievable it doesnt matter if you did something new you must follow the process. its a dinosaur stuck in a 70s80s way of doing things.,Exxon Mobil
21,3 years at mobile,4.0,meet new people enjoy regular customers,customers who dont fallow rules then get mad at you.,Exxon Mobil
22,crap,2.0,easy work people are usually nice no scheduled break so whenever you have time you can smoke or eat,management out of the 7 of us at my location 4 were arrested during their shift including my manager,Exxon Mobil
23,can you handle the politics,3.0,pay as a researcher is excellent. that is the only thing that keeps people here. you know where this is going... good flexible hours benefits etc. with some stigma attached. highly recommended for those who want a job where they can coast with high pay and little likelihood of being fired. lowstress job after a few years. good opportunities for shifting to management role if desired. plenty of rotationaltravel opportunities. lots of career paths to choose from. plenty of smart people to work with and around. plenty of interesting projects to work on.,the management at clinton nj has essentially commandeered the ranking system as a method of lining their own pockets and rewarding their political allies. your rank at the rampd headquarters is mostly just a measure of your political success. i had to see it for many years to finally believe it. the quality of the engineering work and innovation you do is irrelevant to your rank as long as it meets basic requirements. as a researcher with a phd this may cause depression after some number of years but you will get over it exxon is a topdown company with strong managerial control. the topdown approach to research prioritization produces awkward results. be prepared to work on programsprojects which appear totally pointless to you and your colleagues. micromanagement is very common as managers were once engineers themselves. no method of underlings to review supervisor performance. it is a oneway street.,Exxon Mobil
24,change is needed.... mostly in management,2.0,good pay great benefits some genius people work there. emit is a nightmare but in other departments i had friends have quite positive experiences.,i would never recommend any of my computer science minded friends to work here. the work received was fun and challenging but the management structure at xom is atrocious. i definitely left work unhappy more than i did happy and my friends in the company were basically the only reason i made it as long as i did. management is largely untechnical... yet hold a lot of your technical career in their hands. management is also full of extremely unfriendly and unmotivated individuals many just care about climbing the corporate ladder. the job roles you are given probably wont line up with your skill set or your desired skill set.,Exxon Mobil

28,toxic work culture zero worklife balance,1.0,great benefits pension plan insurance salary.,there are a lot of people willing to do whatever it takes to get ahead in the ranking system. this leads to a work culture that doesnt foster teamwork but rather a me first everything else second attitude. supervisors rarely care about how their employees are doing just another hassle to deal with.,Exxon Mobil
29,not ideal,2.0,good benefits dental plan allows cleaning 4 times a year.,people work less but complain more. managers only care about complaints to rate employees. too much politics... managers dont really spend time to develop employees only spend time to make themselves look good in front of senior managers.,Exxon Mobil

42,dog eat dog environment with everyone looking out for their own benefit.,3.0,great benefits great pay enough work to make your head spin,performance reviews need to focus more on actual quality work. rather than focusing on how well you keep everyone happy. upward movement in career is difficult if you are not on the management route. technical personals movements are primarily lateral moves.,Exxon Mobil

54,great opportunities to work on largescale efforts,4.0, very cool to be working on such largescale efforts billiondollar projects some of the largest downstream processing units in north america  smart friendly coworkers i personally havent seen any increased competitiveness due to ranking system even when i interned people were willing to set aside time to teach me  answer my questions  very willing to listen to  address safety concerns, very procedurebased without much emphasis on creative problemsolving and engineering innovation it seems like this may be starting to change but its definitely not there yet  poor worklife balance at sites. it seems like site folks are overworked while others at the houston campus dont have enough to do yet theyre mostly all engineers...  if you start at a site it seems very difficult to get a job either at another site or in an office. starting at refineries seems to give fewer career options than starting at the houston campus.,Exxon Mobil
55,good place to work,5.0,great people process tools and benefits,conservative culture and no telecommuting options,Exxon Mobil
56,management heavy and the micromanagement is off the charts,2.0,good paying job good benefits alot of other perks.,they have no respect for older people and i am not old so i am not writing this about me however they get rid of you if you know too much. they want young ignorant workers who barely can run the units and then upper management micromanages the heck out of you. people get hurt out there unnecessarily due to a fear based safety program that does not prepare you properly. if you do too much they view you as a rule breaker. the benefits are ok but they do not offer a bonus. yes they offer a pension but they place alot of rules around it and it will be lowered by the time you qualify to draw. they push a safety program that focuses on fear and what is the worst that can happen to you to push focus. instead they could help you learn what causes lack of focus and how to prevent it and why it happens along with sharings. they hide alarms because the operators are afraid to alarm due to management documentation of them not being on top of operations and the community reporting releases. very disfunctional group who will get more people hurt because of there programs and policies that are too numerous and too accusatory to let people get better at there jobs.,Exxon Mobil
57,fired while going through personal issues very unethical.,1.0,pay benefits vacation long lunch break,they use you to accomplish 1 goal to make money its all smoke and mirrors fired me when i was going through a rough patch in my personal life. very unethical after almost 8 years of service.,Exxon Mobil

59,it is not always valued,4.0,pay is great for the area benefits are really good solid work life balance,it is treated as a cost center rather than value creator underwhelming vacation package,Exxon Mobil
60,controllers financial analyst,1.0,discounted gas educational reimbursement name recognition job stability they dont lay people off,controllers is sold as rotational finance but you will be entering data into sap and doing accountingbookkeepingjournal entries. accounting and reporting systems are approximately 40 years old. the cool finance jobs business development treasury trading are given to engineers only which explains exxons subpar financial performance relative to peers like chevron and general distaste from wall streetinstitutional investors. very secretive and conservative company not very much diversity. the largest group in controllers appears to be white males from floridas mba program. low pay compared to peers finance function is paid 1015 lower than shell chevron bp.,Exxon Mobil

68,i am new and it is not worth it...,2.0,fantastic paybenefitsamenities especially for new hires... if put in the right section work can be challenging and highimpact at an early stage in ones career... frequent job rotations keep things interesting opportunity for exciting international assignments...if you get picked some coworkers are extremely competent and a lot of fun to work with... if youre the right person you will go very far...see cons, terrible onboarding amp training essentially thrown in the deep end and expected to keep yourself afloat.  a very obvious worklife balance problem that has gone unaddressed for quite some time a lot of lip service from management with very little results. working to neardeath is the norm and anything below that is considered poor performance despite what anyone will tell you. physicalemotionalmental health issues are pervasive and common among coworkers which they will keep secret so it will not be used against them. 95 of the meetings you will have here in your entire career are a complete waste of time and will consider ridiculous questions and considerations with hairsplitting levels of detail the ones from my experience tend to be poorly planned and facilitated leading to what was supposed to be a one hour meeting turning into a 2 hour lecture of the biggest windbags thinking out loud to everyone with no consensus or resolution...until two or three more iterations of these meetings take place. because there are so many of these meetings work can never get donethis is one of the main reasons why the worklife balance is poor. spend the morning amp afternoon surviving meetings spend the nights catching up with work repeat until inevitable burnout. just remember everyone likes the sound of their own voice here plan accordingly...and bring aspirin.  other coworkers are extremely incompetent and make work a nightmare in comparisonif you have a whiff of capability on you they will snuff it out with their toxic personalities and their ability to jockey you around on wild goose chases by offloading their work onto you with minimal guidanceand taking all the credit for anything that looks good of course.  your relationship with your manager is everything especially at the beginning. if your personalities conflict in any wayif heshe likes chocolate and you like vanillait will be used against you. it gets really nauseating seeing the great lengths some would take to get in with their managerespecially during ranking season...aspirin will not be enough...  a lot of backstabbingbootlickingoneuppingunethical practices among peers all in the name of ranking your colleagues are not family but competition to keep a watchful eye on...trust no one.  new hires are treated like idiots with next to no capability common phrase all the new hires know is where the coffee is... if you are one of them you cannot have an opinion in order to have one you will have to be hyperaggressive and outshout your coworkers rather than collaborate with them or wait a few extremely bitter years where competency is measured by something as arbitrary as the number of years had with the company. when that kicks in then take those years of frustration out on the new hires under you to perpetuate this stupid practice. a lot of lip service about being inclusive and empowered influence without authority remains to be a hilariously hypocritical motto commonly used but none of this is in practiceonly the opposite keep your head down shut up and take your beatings and work overnight because i said so. meanwhile experienced hires have issues with being pigeonholed into a position and being trapped there until retirement or they are rotated at a very slow rate relative to their peers who are or were newhiresbasically taking away one of the main reasons for working here frequent job rotations.  rotations are great but they are very rarely planned well most do not ever happen yet are mentioned as if they will and the ones that do give you too little time to prepare  also be ready to accept something that you do not want nor did you ask for in a location you were not too thrilled about. you cannot say no its an option...but it isnt. ranking is a taboo subject for a reason it is an insidious process in that the ones who can influencechangeremove it are those who benefited the most from it so it will never be influencedchangedremoved. its typical that incompetent brownnosers are rewarded in the top third those who keep the lights on are in the middle third and the bottom third are those who are being punished for political reasons looked at the wrong person the wrong way or cared too much about silly things such as the life part in a worklife balance. personal perspective but i feel like this company was designed for only one type of person in mind and those who happen to deviate in one or many ways from this mold will have significant challenges to face working here. if youre sensitive an introvert are polite are secure in yourself and feel no need to compete with others viciously are empathetic have a sense of humor and not afraid to show it are prone to anxietydepression are modest are informal etc. you will be fighting yourself in the name of your career you will need to compromise your identity and the wonderful things that make youwellyou and fit the aforementioned mold if you want to make it here...a fate worse than death if you ask me a walking corpse.  youngsters are typically looking elsewhere to springboard after a few years here and the old folks are basically counting their days until retirement...not a good sign. from personal experience the campusdespite being very pretty and full of amenitiesis basically a very uptight and pretentious country club dress code is strict personnel is tightlipped and formal and the conversations you will have with peers are abysmally shallow on purpose of course the walls have ears. while the sites have some of these tightlipped and formal folks the atmosphere is more intense yet loose with everyone fighting their own respective fire each site is very different some better than others so hope youre in one of the good ones if it applies so it becomes as informal as the dress code there as everyone is essentially in the trenches togetherthese different worlds clash often when they have to work together just another frustration to add to the laundry list. there are so many contractors here doing essentially most of the hard work...it makes you wonder if management trusts the competency of their own employees... bad managerial decisions are made frequently sadly the excrement flows downstream to the poor saps who will clean up the mess hoping it would reflect well in their rankings. generalized comment but a very common one among myself and those who i have had candid conversations with there is no trust in anyone none. micromanagement is the norm here find a study where that is not a terrible management style regardless of your level of competence. coupled with this micromanagement everything has a checklist to go through a process to follow a list of people who have to approve unanimously no decision is solely yours but the decision of a committee on your behalf. nothing is done by you just pending approval from others. and you cannot circumvent or skip these process without going through an even more cumbersome process to skip the aforementioned process. the bureaucracy is beyond perplexing and the fact that people have memorized and defend this is even more perplexing. its weird how what was an initiative to idiotproof everything has only lead to an inefficient weapon used by idiots to punish those who think outside of the box...its a work of art honestly. while there are new initiatives developed to cut down on this red tape they are still using their cumbersome and mindboggling processes to develop this process to cut down on their processes like some kind of ouroboros...again art high attrition rate from the 5year mark onwards due to these aforementioned cons who wants 535 years of this kind of abuse at this rate you would not survive long enough for retirement.,Exxon Mobil

79,if you arent ranked in top 2 year after year expect to find yourself severely underpaid and forgotten,1.0,benefits international work possible global travel,if you are in gsc and if you dont have an engineering degree expect to see very minimal salary adjustment the longer you stay. in gsc a service company you will be on the lowest salary curve c curve compared to a and b curves in money making companies within em. dont expect much recognition either since you are not considered as a business value driving organization. during the downturn management kept telling everyone that no one is getting raises but the executives and top performers were still being rewarded. now an influx of external hires are coming in at salaries 3040 higher than existing employees which leaves very little room for raises to those who put in the work over the years. the antiquated ranking system is very subjective and unless youve made sponsors very high up and very early in your career you will most likely fall into the middle and stay in the middle. also unless you say im a lifer and unless you were flagged as a hypo high potential in the first 5 years  you will be passed over. women are not promoted the same way men are  that is further evident by the embarrassingly low number of female executives are at the top. its still a very much a good ol boys club where men are groomed for leadership position. what iampd... give me a break.,Exxon Mobil

97,baton rouge professional engineering,4.0,if youre a dedicated hard worker good at relationship buildingmaintaining and perform well in the ranking this company will take you as far as youre willing to go. your promotions will occur quickly and raises to follow. the career  professional development you will receive will set you up well for a long career within exxonmobil or anywhere else. at the manufacturing level technical careers are not valued the same as management development so many people feel pressured to stay on the management path to get out of the site to hq before they express their true interest in other paths not related to management. folks that are placed into high visibility roles early receive an abundance of guidance and support to ensure success which leads to quick development and promotions. the company tries very hard and effectively to gain great diversity in its hiring classes. for engineering in the southern us i see more women and minority engineers than may other companies.,if youre not in the top 20 of the ranking and more specifically the top ranked individuals after 510 years your career slows down very quickly as do the raises and promotions. the ranking system is not perfect and management perception can carry more weight than performance even though management says thats not the case. folks have been held back from promotions that are ranked at the top due to lack of visibility visibility is position dependent and not due to lack of performance or capability and can not easily be factor into the ranking system. or a manager 12 levels above has no real direct experience with an individual yet discredits them for some small reason hurting raisepromotional opportunities. it is very hard to advance on a technical career path and many technical folks become frustrated when their management development peers quickly accelerate through promotions and raises without much differentiation in ability or contribution. work life balance is not encouraged or rewarded. its considered normal to work 1012 hour days. many employees feel that this leads to folks who can stay at work that many hours regular get promoted faster. folks who are not placed into high visibility roles can often be prioritized resources development and oversight from management leading to a sink or swim environment. leading to a lack of visibility and resources to accomplish work which is then unfairly reflected in the rankings. with the great diversity every year of the incoming hiring classes its interesting to see a serious lack of diversity in the site management team mostly white men a few women and slim to no minorities. no internal job postings. youre held responsible to drive career discussion with your supervisor. then job moves are generally communicated to employees less than 2 weeks in advance and if they arent align with the employees desires theres very little time time to work alternatives without a feeling of that potentially hurting your career.,Exxon Mobil

220,analyst and technician,3.0,many of the employees are great to work with and the company does offer good salaries and benefits.,horrible performance review system. you are ranked in groups. a few people are at the top a few at the bottom and the majority in the middle. it usually amounts to a popularity contest rather than based upon your actual performance. you end up being ranked by some supervisors who dont even know you and the jobs included in the ranking groups are often very different. this makes it very difficult to rank people correctly. i was in the top ranking group for most of my career but was transferred to a new group. in my first ranking session in the new group i fell down two ranking groups and was told that i was a poor performer. instead of helping me to improve they gave me more assignments so that i fell behind. no matter how hard i tried they kept putting obstacles in my way. i was told that i could separate or be put on a two month performance improvement plan and that if i didnt improve during this time period i would be terminated. i chose to retire early since i was planning to retire in a few years. for most of my 32 years of employment it was a good experience but it shouldnt be so easy for a new group to drop someone two levels in the ranking. the new group that i was transferred to had employees who would sabotage and lie about other employees so that they would remain in their current ranking group. it was ironic considering that the company wants employees to be team players and to have to have integrity. yet this ranking systems pits people against each other and employees who feel threatened often resort to sabotage so that they retain their ranking. also my group lead had 49 input into my ranking and was in the same ranking group that i was in.,Exxon Mobil

227,a decent first stop after undergrad no more,2.0,training opportunities. youll also get a good handle on processes and controls. if you are a campus hire and catch the eye of a cl 30 senior you can go very far and get paid more than you honestly should by market standards just by paying your dues.,upward mobility is hindered currently for the rest. exxon will give you three years of decent salary treatments to incentivize you to stay. after that the raises suddenly become nominal  mostly adjusted for inflation 12 every 14 months is typical. the salary bands and promotion scheme is heavily skewed to retain the top 15. the budget allocates around 75 of salary treatment to these individuals. this means even if you fall within the top 70  80th percentile you wont be getting those good raises. its a lifer company which sounds good at the onset but it encourages a mindset similar to complacency since many are not happy with their roles or understood trajectory yet know they can get away with doing very little without getting fired. this lack of productivity is then absorbed by new hires that are seeking to prove themselves during their first couple of years.,Exxon Mobil

233,good stepping stone for grads  only stay if youre deemed a high potential,1.0,training is valued the first few years and emphasized by supervisors. getting in with the right manager and getting labeled a high potential aka hipo can really set you up on the fast track. there are plenty of executives and managers that clearly got in based on the sponsors they had because they certainly dont have the experiencetalent to have gotten there based on merit alone. starting salary is way above market value  this can be a huge plus for engineers right out of undergrad but any midcareer person will tell you that the salary bumps end pretty quickly after the first 3 years. however this headstart can set you up for a higher salary than your peers at another company if you time it right. there are some great people who work here and genuinely want to make a positive change and set up others for success. getting the right manager seems to be the key to success.,mentality that theres no better place to be  breeds complacency in processes and culture. employees especially some baby boomers who are just waiting around at this point know they dont have to do much to just move along through assignments  anyone will tell you that the only 2 reasons you can be fired are 1 misusing your amex and 2 hr issues no 980s only major to not implement them  huge con for worklife balance micromanagement  people are not 1 given enough responsibility and 2 constantly double and triplechecked to make sure theyve followed the process there is next to no room for innovation because people are not trusted to make decisions without supervisory approval seriously have a little faith. i literally heard a manager say i doubt the new hires know much more than where the coffee is. and do not expect to be in any kind of supervisory role until you have at least 58 years with the company  they simply dont believe youre ready for it. managed moves  you do not own your career and there is no job posting system. any moves are handled by your supervisor who acts as your advocate. they will try and spin it different ways this is a great opportunity and say that people planning is a twoway street with your supervisor. the reality is that you can put in your interests and geographical constraints but at the end of the day if you are in the top 10 your career will be expedited through targeted assignments. if youre everyone else itll be highly dependent on your relationship with your supervisor and the extent of their network. if they dont know about a job you wont ever find out about it. mentorship is lacking  it is encouraged among prospective mentees but not much among potential mentors very few are willing to give their time to newer employees grandfathered medical benefits plan does not have to meet all aca requirements ladies your birth control is not covered 100 ranking system is tied to salary  only the top 10 really see the big bucks and the rest of the company will start to be paid below market value around midcareer  its no secret that during high oil prices em people around the 510 year mark will leave to chevronshelletc because the salaries are much more alluring and 980s  25 more vacation days,Exxon Mobil

404,great place to work,5.0,exxonmobil wants you to work there for your entire career so they try to provide a healthy worklife balance with a broad range of assignments in order to help you to grow and learn without burning out. the new campus is an incredible facility that provides a terrific work environment. i work with brilliant people on challenging assignments. they offer competitive pay with a pension and workplace flexibility to work from home when needed.,houston is not the prettiest place ive ever lived in originally from washington state. while having a broad range of assignments can have its advantages you can feel like you become a generalist thats good at a lot of things but not an expert in one particular field.,Exxon Mobil
405,it support,4.0,safe stable peaceful everything is planned for a long term although plans can change there is no rush everything must be safe and done by the book clear policies great management of technology although some novices may think that the company is old fashioned but they do know how to invest in technology and give to the users what they need not what they want because of their status quo al technology must be approved it folks hate this but they dont understand how it governance must be lead in global environment without killing the budget so xom is right in taking things slowly but reliable and feasible the new campus is outstanding not yet ready and work at home is a great choice.,is not easy to grow but the salary is good enough they wont allow you to be individualist and implement cool but not safe technology it really sucks to have a bad boss they will ignore you but you still stable because their hr systems work is hard to compete in a global environment dont expect huge salaries but quality life along time get used to follow the sun and work with people around the world.,Exxon Mobil

414,pretty satisfying workplace,4.0,good salary benefits interesting work,bureaucracy resistance to change abhors 9 80s.,Exxon Mobil
415,bad culture,2.0, you get paid very well  you can usually stay employed there for life if you want to and are competent in your job  the medial and 401k benefits are hard to beat., very hostile workplace culture. the ranking system for engineers makes everyone very competitive and unwilling to assist their coworkers.  your coworkers dont feel like family. people dont look out for each other.  you are expected to work ridiculous hours in most engineering positions. if you have endeavors outside of work that take up significant amounts of time this isnt the company for you.,Exxon Mobil
416,invoicing specialist,4.0,the knowledge you obtain you can take with you to your next job,its a project based company,Exxon Mobil
417,stable company with best benefits,5.0,very stable company that pays a high base salary. because of size of company its benefits are unmatched.,due to its high standards a initial recruiting of college students you work with high achieving individuals so its hard to differentiate yourself when youre as high achieving as everyone else. the forced ranking system can be very political and an hr numbers game.,Exxon Mobil
418,gas man,4.0,great aggressive organization focused on results with good performance pay.,lack of brand identity with the two brands exxon and mobil,Exxon Mobil
419,cashier,5.0,i loved and miss my job,wish i didnt quit my job,Exxon Mobil
420,most conservative corporation ive ever known,3.0, long term stability compared to rest of industry  highly educated peers  large enough to provide some diversity of roles  leadership recognition and training  longterm investment in employees with training and career development  international opportunities  multifunctional collaboration  true dedication to employee safety on and of the job, stifling hierarchical environment  lip service to diversity  tendency to appeal to the most conservative and lowest common denominator approach to recognition of the value of diversity improving slowly  favoritism to yesmen as opposed to creativity or truthtellers  far too many managers  micromanagement  meetings before meetings before meetings are expected and crucial and waste huge amounts of time so that everyone can constantly save face in front of bosses and appear to be in constant harmony  lags rest of industry in some aspects of technical innovation although company maintains uniform technical arrogance  increasing consolidation in houston with no options for employment anywhere else in the us,Exxon Mobil
421,great experience,4.0,the people here really demonstrate what it means to be high quality while also very humble. as an intern you get a project that you work on over the course of the summer and then present to a room of more than 50 managers who will question you regarding your findings. theres a great deal of autonomy in approaching the solution to your problem. your supervisor acts as a sounding board but wont hold your hand through it and thats great. at the end of the summer you know youve made an impact on an important business project. the new campus is amazing and probably one of the best environments that you could work in.,there is often times a not broke dont fix it attitude when it comes to improvements. you can definitely see the lack of agility within the company but thats to be expected with a company so large. the new campus is an example of how theyre trying to get out of that stuffy mindset but it will take time.,Exxon Mobil
422,stable job with good worklife balance.,4.0,the worklife balance has been really good. rarely do i need to work more than 40 hours and i have the flexibility to arrive late at times or leave early at other times. working remotely is also a plus. the people are great to work with. the company has moved away from not adopting new technology to leading change across the industry and getting more involved with major software developersit shops in influencing their software road maps. i have little concern of ever losing my job.,i dont know many people who actually like their ranking system. its awful and poisonous. annual salary increases are not very much and you have to work 25 years for the pension plan to be meaningful. if you want to be a fast high wage earner you should look elsewhere because here are many other companies that will boost your wage faster.,Exxon Mobil
423,big company slow to change,3.0,good benefits pension and company matching and job security tough to get fired. a lot of smart people work here. good support of industry technologies and technical groups maintain good work life balance.,23 managers have a poor work life balance and reward those who imitate it i.e. working long hours and weekends is rewarded vs efficiencyresults,Exxon Mobil
424,gas attendant,3.0,i just got paid and covered the bills,the power of the franchisee is so disgusting  harsh treatment to employees,Exxon Mobil
425,good company for career development,4.0,there are great career development opportunities. internal and external trainings at your fingertips. great flexible work hours. you work with some very competent people.,too much corporate bureaucracy. very conservative company. technology seems to be behind the industry standards most of the time. there are definitely gender and racial preferences for certain positions. you are ranked against your peers every year so your career advancement and raise partially depend on how well your manager represent you at ranking sessions.,Exxon Mobil
426,rs intern,3.0,pay relocation assistance flexible hours and benefits are phenomenal for an intern. very diverse workplace full of intelligent individuals. highcaliber work and trust level. interdisciplinary approach to problemsolving.,slow pace bureaucratic questionable decision making conservative business strategy low employee morale very clear pecking order horribly convoluted databases dangerous work environment outdated equipment outdated management strategies.,Exxon Mobil
427,reality of working for clarks,3.0,loved my manager  co workers...we were like family...props to mrs. tammy edmond,new manager...entire new crew...managers are supposed to set the example to all employees not let ur manager title go to your head,Exxon Mobil
428,politics draconian ranking system zero worklife balance good opportunities,1.0,great opportunities to travel the world and make an impact abroad. coworkers are very smart and capable. lots of training opportunities.,the ranking system is completely based on politics. people are force ranked in a straight line and the ranking is based on your perceived relative performance as compared with your peer group. you can get ranked very low for doing an excellent job because a manager perceives that you didnt do your own job as well as someone else or they just like this person more with a similar or even unrelated job. getting ranked low once is almost impossible to come back from as the ranking is cumulative instead of different year to year. managers and supervisors dont have your back either though there are exceptions. all of this fosters a hypercompetitive and stressful environment that is counterproductive to teamwork and collaboration. new positions or opportunities are usually forced on you as there are no internal postings. saying no to a position is essentially a death knell for your career despite the circumstances of your decline. worklife balance is nonexistent. people work from early in the morning to late at night 5 days a week and people come in on the weekend.,Exxon Mobil
429,good but not perfect,4.0,they pay well especially considering the cost of living in houston. some people will tell you exxonmobil is safety crazy its true but it has benefits. they have a high emphasis on ergonomics everyone has great equipment for coding 8 hrs per day sitstand desk ergo friendly mouse and keyboard. fairly low stress no strict deadline no forced 80 hour weeks etc.. you can work a regular 40 hrs and be totally fine but probably wont standout. surrounded by very smart people problems are generally challenginginteresting. youll change jobs every 25 years so you shouldnt get bored and are constantly learning. very stable basically 0 layoffs during these tough times were other large companies i.e. chevron are firing lots of people.,not really a software shop the organization of software development is nothing like youd see at a company like microsoft or google. sometime a lot of red tape to step through road blocks that prevent you from using the latest and great technology. ranking system isnt that great lots of competition you have to play the game right to get ahead. you have to do lots of extra initiatives to be noticed being good at your job isnt enough. working at the upstream research company you arent valued as much as an engineer or geoscientist exxonmobil it doesnt garner the same respect.,Exxon Mobil
430,great company with traditional corporate values,5.0,excellent salary very knowledgable and experienced coworkers and subject matter experts. rarely did i feel an answer to a question was more than a phone call away. great opportunity to see the world. conservative approach as compared to others ep operators allows it be profitable and stable during downturns.,rating and ranking systems dont always capture value individual employees bring to the organization. bureaucracy of management systems can be frustrating and requires employees to understand intent of the systems rather than the letter of the law to be effective for managing the business.,Exxon Mobil
431,petroleum geologist,5.0,traveling all over the world,many places that i worked at were far off and long hours,Exxon Mobil

435,long term career,4.0,challenging work environment job opportunities salary benefits people training,your career is owned by your direct supervisormanager not you so if you have a bad relationship with your boss or they simply have their interests above yours then you can be stuck in an assignment or not in control of the next job you get. no 980s.,Exxon Mobil
436,amazing opportunities and longterm investment in your career,5.0,commitment to operational integrity and ethical execution of business practices. strong emphasis on safety and operational excellence across all lines of business from the top to the bottom. exxonmobil is a company that invests in an individual over their entire career and offers amazing benefits while engaging employees in challenging and rewarding projects. flexible work arrangements are very useful and have helped me tremendously.,exxonmobil is a large company and executing the various work processes can take time. complexity of various systems is often unnecessary or poorly communicated down the line. it resources are somewhat outdated in some business units.,Exxon Mobil
437,great company but with very conservative team environment,4.0, great compensation  lots of opportunity to grow, lots of office politics which often drives the annual performance review  very conservative working environment you have to respect the seniority otherwise you would get a very adverse effect on the performance evaluation,Exxon Mobil
438,excellent company to work for,5.0,strong career focused company that affords its employees many opportunities to travel and work in all aspects of the company. they have an extremely strong executive leadership development program with many great people that work for the company. additionally the benefits including pension plan and workplace flexibility policy help the make exxonmobil one of the best companies you could work for in this day in age. also appreciate the ranking system at the company the great rewards hard work but is still fair to folks who are not top performers.,limited cons but at the moment the one thing that sticks out is that the stock is flat over the last 10 years,Exxon Mobil
439,worked in technology business and manufacturing within chemicals,4.0,people are great and fun to work with. company is strong and good morals. new campus is awesome. disciplined approach to everything.,no 980s. very demanding and competitive within work groups. facilities are old and need of a revamp like the new campus.,Exxon Mobil
440,ok,3.0,smart people high salaries beautiful campus,houston bureaucracy large company good ol boys,Exxon Mobil
441,average oil and gas company,3.0,the best reasons to work for them are the world class assets they have in their portfolio and the financial might they wield. pay and benefits is competitive and pension is first class. the new houston campus is amazing but it is 25 mikes north of the city.,downsides of working for this company are that no matter what they say financial results are more important than anything. people are not their most important asset even if they say that. in the current market environment 3q 2015 they are taking the scalpel to staff. you will not hear about mass layoffs but the bottom 10 and those who have suggested near term retirement are being showed the door. most contract staff has or will be let go as well. forced ranking is an archaic method to evaluate people and unfairly allows the coasters at the top to keep coasting and the workers everywhere else to suffer. pay is pegged to rank. it is still an old boys network and a new girls network is being started.,Exxon Mobil
442,stay as long as you want,5.0,career minded many stay 35 years. clean safe family friendly work environment.,rapidly losing opportunities for travel and expat assignments us converging in houston business support centers opening with local talent s.america malaysia india. since the oil industry is cyclical software engineers can get stuck with salary freezes even though the tech industry may be booming.,Exxon Mobil

567,individual contributor model vs. team model,3.0,central management is the norm at exxonmobil not a federated model. this can help in pushing management initiatives downward. however this can be difficult in getting things accomplished without a number of stakeholders approvals.,although there are a number of job opportunities for advancement this is a very individual contributor mentality driven company. there is very little team development and only those who are aggressive at the expense of others they are ranked against on the same team will move forward. if you are good at selling your own agendas at the expense of others and sacrificing your work life balance you will be rewarded monetarily.,Exxon Mobil

621,a great place to start a career,4.0,exxon mobil is the industry leader. they have the money and the resources to research develop and produce top notch solutions to technological challenges. they pay excellent salaries provide ample training to maintain expertise and offer opportunities in many different fields. the safety culture is among the best.,the company is very conservative and can miss out on first mover opportunities. the employee appraisal rating and ranking system is antiquated and widely disliked.,Exxon Mobil
622,poor working environment,1.0,good starting pay stable job environment plenty of career opportunities if your willing to travel strong culture of safety gas discount at the pump interesting and varied work,low workforce moral. the culture is toxic. although this is highly dependent on where you work as the culture of each siteoffice can vary widely. the low moral is everywhere  from entry level to managers. nearly everyone is either openly bitter or discontent. people stay primarily to receive a paycheck in order to pay their bills. very few workers are actually happy to be there and come to work because they enjoy it. negativity is quite pervasive. i can literally count on one hand how many times ive heard someone make positive comments in all my years here. on the other hand i can fill a book with the number of negative comments. very high attrition rate. younger folks are leaving all the time. those who have been around longer seem to be imprisoned with golden handcuffs and are literally waiting around to hit that magic age when they can finally retire and collect their pension. management seems to care less that people are constantly leaving before their prime. clandestine ranking system. highly subjective and not a true meritocracy as its very dependent on what managers think about you and not so much on actual work output. perception is everything. if youre not willing to puckerup your lips and schmooze or you dont get along with your manager you can kiss your career goodbye. pay is good for new hires and drops off sharply thereafter. the pay eventually plateaus unless you are continuously promoted. no bonus of any kind of profit sharing unless you are a higher level manager. lack of accountability or expectations. people are rarely held accountable for their actions  especially managers. roles and responsibilities are written down but not consistently followed or enforced. positions are literally reinvented as new people rotate into them. poor management. too many new managers who have no idea how to manage and older managers who would rather be individual contributors or simply dont care anymore and are just waiting to retire. the good managers are few and far inbetween. unfortunately they tend to rotate away and never comeback. management provides little vision or direction. most of them are just checking the box and trying to survive to their next rotation. managers keep implementing new initiatives and reorganizations when they are absolutely clueless as to their chances for success. there is no acknowledgement as to why past initiatives failed and why these new ones will work. the managers like to point fingers and rarely take ownership and blame for their shortcomings. heaven forbid its ever managements fault for something as that would damage their careers which seems to be their only concern. there is a so much rotational movement in management that there is an endless cycle of initiatives agendas and policies. refining business has been tough since the economic downturn. exxonmobil treats production sites and the workers there like a commodity that can be bought or sold at anytime. unless youre a high level manager you will be sold to the highest bidder at the right price. lazy workforce that is extremely contractor dependent. the contractors tend to do most of the real work. tons of procedures and guidelines on almost everything. the problem is not everyone follows them or even know they exist. as a result the vast majority of guidelines and procedures are not accurately followed and simply ignored. very little training. all the training is focused on safety and you are rarely trained on actually how to do your job. only operationsmaintenance workers tend to have some type of set training plan. otherwise its a free for all and you are left on your own to figure out how to do your job if your manager isnt proactive in developing you. safety culture is a bit too strong even in comparison to other exxonmobil sites. all everyone talks about is safety and its been taken to an almost painful extreme. everyone is forced to do field observations each month. most people think its a joke exercise  something forced upon them by management. very few people actually believe in it but its taboo to say that openly.,Exxon Mobil
623,exxonmobil pipeline is one of the best companies to work for.,5.0,excellent benefits good salaries and overall good working environment. good performance is recognized and rewarded.,work load sometimes requires long hours and there were times when you felt long hours were expected.,Exxon Mobil

637,rewarding experience with lots of handson work.,4.0,if youre interested in chemical engineering em is the ideal place for you. the whole industry focuses around chemical engineering with lots of support groups to help you accomplish your job. as another engineer you play primarily a support role. while the compensation is great the role changes little when advancing outside of chemical engineering. in essence you always support chemical engineers but some people like this aspect of the job because youre always working with people. again great benefits and competitive pay.,not the greatest location. beaumont is a big city with enough activity to keep you entertained however you shouldnt expect the grandeur of a stereotypical big city.,Exxon Mobil
638,the best of companies the worst of companies,3.0,research freedom relatively high compared to other industries  competitors high caliber colleagues technically and morally safest place on earth very stable,ranking process is highly political not based on performance or impact pay is just enough to keep you according to senior management employees not valued by management no good locations e.g. houston houston houston,Exxon Mobil
639,the chosen ones vs everyone else,1.0,financial stability of company good culture of working together industry leader in technology strong safety culture,exxonmobils entire corporate culture is a function of its ranking system. in a nutshell everyone in an range of jobs is forceranked. so you are either listed as the 1 employee the 27 or the 100 or anywhere in between. in theory it is an objective way to move the best people to the top and show the worst people the door. its extremely political and is more of a popularity contest for everyone except maybe your own manager. what is messed up is that if you are not in the top 10 then exxon basically treats you like your career is completely worthless and you are lucky just to be there. i have worked at exxon for about 10 years i have only been in the top 13 and was basically told were moving you to a job that you dont want and wont be good at but we dont really care about you. someone else needs to check a box and you are in the job that they need to check it. unfortunately the whole system is run by the people that did well in it so as far as they know the system works well. it promotes people that think act and talk like them. they keep getting more and more money and better and more interesting jobs. as far as theyre concerned all the other people in the company should count themselves lucky just to have jobs.,Exxon Mobil
640,good for a few years but quickly grows stagnant.,1.0,good experience with a well known company. if you put a lot of work into it you can build a very nice resume after a few years.,there are little to not growth opportunities no matter how competent you are. it feels very stagnant and the environment is extremely negative. management gives the impression that they couldnt care less about your career or goals.,Exxon Mobil

644,positive experience overall but with a lot of stress placed on you daily to preform or leave,3.0,professional work atmosphere. amount of team support given on a project is pretty good. if you are in the club you could get to work all over the world.,so far the employees are professional and overall intelligent. however the expectations are very high and often times unrealistic leading to large amounts of stressful situations. advancement for younger employees is often times controlled by managers with not much experience in managing people. when you first start working they will start determining the highest you will ever move up in the company which makes it hard to break some preconceived mold they put you in.,Exxon Mobil

654,lots of talk little action.,3.0,focus on safety. very process driven. many controls. training is encouraged and supported. small work groups. many opportunities to work on global teams and make many overseas friendships. upper management has a very high level of integrity and permeates this attitude throughout all the business processes. most people that i interacted with were some of the most honest people ive ever met.,the technology is there we just cant use all of it. the technology in use today is what other companies were using 810 years ago. lots of very smart people but very few smes subject matter experts due to frequent change of assignments. i originally viewed this to be very appealing however many employees typically have the attitude of lets just do it this way...because in 3 years from now we wont be in this group anymore and itll be someone elses problem. this results in only the very motivated people to become smes. there is almost zero automation....almost all processes must be done manually. recurring meetings continually just talk about things and changes take forever to implement. and....why wont upper management hurry up and own up to the consolidated campus in spring tx rather than let employees hear about it in the houston chronicle.,Exxon Mobil
655,enslaved,2.0,good retirement at age 55 job security good pay,overtime is all the time and mandatory they do not assist you when you need time off contract is up every 3 years risking potential strike or lockout you are treated horribly you work nightsweekendsholidaysdays  1216 hour rotating shifts you are put in catch 22 scenarios on a daily basis and with 10 supervisors telling you to do different things it makes work harder than it should be the job is dangerous and if something happens to you they find a way to make it your fault good luck,Exxon Mobil
656,difficult to move around. little feedback in possibilities for either lateral movement or responsibility increase.,3.0,management generally respectful to employees although contractors still can find it difficult to integrate with coworkers. flex time is one of the best things they have done ability to be flexible with work hours. work environment is very relaxed it network. most employee environment is generally welcoming and interesting to be around. teamwork good.,it personnel network admins not having admin rights to their own laptops as a given. imagine being unable to do a job because you dont have the drivers installed for a usb cable to console cable laptop didnt have db9 serial port... biggest problem was overbearing restriction in work duties. read only access is given to network techs who support the customers. no port vlan changes etc.. very inefficient and demoralizing to employees especially those who had their rights taken away when the change first happened. also greatly increased downtime of customers by making techs unable to make port config changes instantly must submit request up. contractors have been treated better recently but lack of ease to become permanent hired was not what i expected from the contracttohire description on contract.,Exxon Mobil
657,well run company but only favorable to a few employees,2.0,the pay is above average he management is honest for the most part good business ethethis but not straightforward with emloyees. good office environment private offices not cubicles,computer science people just carry water for the engineers. all decision making is the engineers they are better paied as well. maganement line supervisors are rewarded for building the career of one or two people the rest be damed no oppertunity at all.,Exxon Mobil

661,great compensation weak career development.,4.0,compensation is amazing. you will not be able to find another job in any other field given commensurate experience that will compensate you as well as xom will. their 401k match is unheard of and in an uncertain economic environment offering a pension is unthought of. however xom proudly offers a pension program for its employees. whenever a relocation is involved xom will provide more than adequate funds to do so. if a relocation is required while within in the company it is absolutely impossible to take a loss on selling your home.,exxonmobils company culture is the more conservative than anything i had imagined. while management advertises a good balance between work and personal life the successful employees at the company do not have a personal life. career development is too oldschool. youre ranked among peers and promotions are decided by a closed door committee. job openings are not announced within in the company until they have been filled. working for the company requires you to move every 35 years to take a new position. while its possible to stay in the same position and location doing so will hinder your ability for increased compensation.,Exxon Mobil

682,get away from xom as soon as you get 35 years of experience.,2.0,the only good thing at xom is reputation and to enlight your resume. yes you will learn a lot. people are smart and good at what they do but they are brainwashed and like robots. amazing how they obey the rules and how scared employees are. young people please leave them after 35 years otherwise they will destroy your life and career.,the worst compensation among operators. maybe a little bit higher salary but thats it. no bonuses at all no stock options no anything else. an average 401k vacation etc worse than other majors. even the worst holiday plan 8 paid public holidays. the only operator in houston that does not have flex schedule and does not have bonus. you will work overtime. they use and abuse employees. they torture you psychologically. they want to scare you to do what you are told to do. they tell you if you dont do what i tell you you will be the bottom one. no innovation at all. no creativity. an old technology. they are scared that someone will steal technology that they dont have. it is like a military and even worse. very sensitive people. i dont understand is why people stay. you can go anywhere else work less be more respected and make more money,Exxon Mobil
683,a good job but not a career.,2.0,good pay prestige. the best part of working for exxonmobil was that other employees trusted that you were an expert in your area and took you at your word. the company generally smart capable people and there are very few incompetents.,rating and ranking of employees eads was based less on your abilities and more on how good your manager was and whether or not they would go to bat for you as a good employee. employees are overworked and expected to put in 50 hours a week. taking vacation is officially encouraged but in practice discouraged except for the last two weeks of the year. us employees have to pick up the slack for international employees. the company is too restrictive in its practices and is entirely too risk adverse. that means that you will have to fill out a risk assessment for all projects regardless of their value. expect to carry your blackberry 247 and expect to get in trouble if you dont answer an email on a sunday morning within 10 minutes of getting it.,Exxon Mobil

686,dont walk run away if you actually want to do science.,2.0,decent compensation convenient work hours  flexibly with worklife balance  can work from home on occasion if needed nice people smart people nice benefits 401k pension etc. chance to travel,scientists do very little science. most of the scientists are mired in tons and tons of bureaucratic nonsense. it is very frustrating brilliant people with ph.d.s are spending the bulk of their time filling out forms in a database jockeying samples and working the financials with vendors. most research isnt research at all. its mixology and filling out forms. nothing is very new certainly not cutting edge. bureaucracy is debilitating. 95 of the work comprises filling out forms getting approvals and fighting with a database in order to actually get something fairly simple accomplished. performance expectations are vague the rating system is not fair and pits peers against each other. people on wildly different assignments doing wildly different jobs are ranked against each other. forget doing any kind of team research. researchers pretty much work alone which means theres no constant banter and exchange of ideas with respect to what research actually is going on. sections need to be broken down into smaller teams so people dont end up working in a vacuum. technical expertise is not rewarded. very political. corporate clonehood rewarded as opposed to fresh ideas and innovative thinking. culture is extremely dominated by white guys. females are subtlely marginalized given projects which are less technical given more administrative tasks etc.,Exxon Mobil
687,great pay and benefits but unenjoyable cultureworkplace,2.0,exxon is a formal and very conservative company with incredible pay and benefits. there is a big emphasis on worklife balance and from that respect they treat their employees very well. if you are in the right area the hours are very reasonable and many managers are accommodating to the needs of employees as long as their work is done. the company is solid financial footing and is very good at what they do. if you are selected as a high potential individual early in your career you will do very well and have many opportunities but if you arent then you will do the same basic job for the rest of your life.,the culture leaves a lot to be desired. there is a lot of arrogance about how great the company is few people will admit how much the profitability relies on the price of oil which is very much out of their control. it is as far from an entrepreneurial environment as company could be many people there believe that if there was a better way to do things someone would have thought of it years before...not the place for someone who isnt willing to conform to a very rigid company. the another concern is that there is a great deal of offshoring if you arent an engineer or a manager job security seems pretty poor compared to years ago with lots of positions going to lower cost locations overseas.,Exxon Mobil

690,dissatisfied,2.0,big company to work for,no recognition to new employees,Exxon Mobil
691,good place to start,4.0,really great people to work with who are highly motivated and very helpful. company invests a lot of time and money to train you for the job and doesnt assign you an actual area of responsibility until after several months of training and shadowing another field engineer. pay and benefits are good as is workplace and work time flexibility.,company does not readily embrace new technology and exxonmobil it makes it difficult to get things done. computers that are provided are slow and cumbersome to use as they are heavily restricted and controlled by it. there is a process for everything and lots and lots of paperwork. often it feels as if they dont really care if the job gets done as long as the paperwork is in order.,Exxon Mobil
692,a great place to be from,3.0,a great to place to get your first 2510 years of experience stellar quality of people ethical knowledgeable superviosrs abundance of inhouse knowledge and expertise in every area of the law and great willingness to mentor. in all a perfect environement to learn proper client interaction etiquette and hone legal skills. a very professional atmosphere and a lot of autonomy early on in your career.,plan on working 60 hour weeks with work days stretching across global time zones. lots of lateral movement and crosstraining with few opportunities for upward movement. couple that with zero bonuses and modest mostly inflationbased raises.,Exxon Mobil

694,great place to work,4.0,this company has a very competitive work environment which helps contribute to the overall success of the company. i would highly recommend it as a place to start a career.,it is a large corporation and therefore it can be difficult to advance easily. it also governed by many procedures and processes.,Exxon Mobil
695,solid company with decent work opportunities but conforming management that only like to do things a certain way,3.0,exxonmobil was a great place to start your career. i spent 4 years at the refinery and for the most part i was pretty satisfied. however i knew i was not a lifer as with most of the younger engineers no one really seems to want to stay and work for the company beyond 5 to 10 years. working for exxon is kind of a catch 22 you are well compensated work conditions are good but everyone always talks about leaving. some of the pros well compensated big raises year in and year out great benefits7 401k match full tuition reimbursement except they changed the rules for mba recently plenty of formal training opportunities to travel work on exciting and new problems every day never the same in a refinery amazing pension if you can make that long on site gym full basketball court,i think the biggest problem facing this company is dealing with gen x and y work force who want the social comforts such as flexible work schedule snacks freedom creativity etc. the company is so old school in that it believes that compensation is every when it comes to a workplace and so in my opinion you will see a lot of people especially younger employees exiting for jobs. it amazed me how so many people from 30 year vets to new hires complained so much about working for the company. several managers would often joke with younger engineers to get out now. the other older work force seemed trapped by the compensation and promise of a pension or else they might leave too. additionally the management at the refinery was for the most part awful. yes they were smart and understood all the risks to their decision making but were often overly conservative afraid to spend money and conformed to what every other manager and person did. i wont go on too much but here are the cons which i believe outweigh the pros. conforming managementto move up you have to be just like the last guy no creativity or innovative approach management is completely out of tune with the plant top down approach to management decisions  poor company morale a very secretive and political ranking system that determines promotion and raises terrible about communicating your future moves and growth,Exxon Mobil
696,good company with excellent benefits. most employees are engineers or scientests with advanced degrees.,4.0,pretty good respect for the controllers organization. strong business controls over daily operations.,top down command control  communications type management. need to be able to follow instructions.,Exxon Mobil

701,fair,3.0,lots of opportunities ive learned a ton sometimes you have to offer your assistance to get the good projects however.,too many people sometimes i feel like im part of a zoo several colleagues have been there for 10 years and not advanced.,Exxon Mobil
702,one has to be very aggressive to survive in exxon,1.0,interesting research state of the art equipment and facilities stable company good books accounting competent pay and benefits emphasis on safety,relative grading for deciding compensation...serial not coarse grading highly aggressive and extrovert people rewarded lot of politics competition managerial skills rewarded more than technical competence,Exxon Mobil
703,exxonmobil production company pros and cons,5.0,exxonmobil seems to be a highly ethical company regardless of what the media tend to report. my experience there was very good and i felt like the management listened to the needs of the employees. the compensation and benefits package was above average for the industry and raises were meritbased which provided a great opportunity for new employees to prove themselves and be rewarded for it. there was also a general sense of teamwork among most of the people in my department although i heard that was not the case in all departments.,the oil and gas industry is still very much an old boys club and exxonmobil is no exception. since the company has been around for over 100 years there is a tendency to do things the way theyve always been done even if its outdated or inefficient. this stifles employees creativity and makes them robots. management likes to use a lot of buzzwords and talk about worklife balance but its apparent that asking for a flexible schedule or taking too much maternity leave are still frowned upon and as a result have a negative impact on merit raises and promotion.,Exxon Mobil
704,great compensation and opportunities,4.0,the compensation is great. my salary has grew 33 in 18 months with the company and continues to be trending upward even in the current economic downturn. the work is challenging and the opportunities are amazing. i mentioned i like to travel and they have sent me all over the world. i have been to 5 different countries since i have started and seem to find more and more reasons to travel. working on world class projects that you can read about in the papers gives me a sense of accomplishment. the people i work with are very intelligent which makes the my day and work week more enjoyable.,the politics can be overwhelming but if you can play the game it can help your career.,Exxon Mobil
705,good stable jobs,4.0,exxon jobs are very stable. if you do well there are lots of opportunities for you to develop both technically and if you so desire from the management perspective.,if you are an average performer and this in exxons mind is essentially 33 of the population 33 is below average the remainder top then you should be satisfied just doing what youre doing and your salary will still be very good. if you want to make the really big bucks and youre average its not going to happen. perhaps if you live in a low cost area such as houston or baton rouge the average salary is going to take you very far but in the dc area this is not the case.,Exxon Mobil
706,young engineer with mixed feelings,2.0,pay of course. the name means something means you are successful. but thats it,lacks diversity big time not just color personality and just flat out differences very cold environment and not people friendly. has few support networks for minorities and younger people most of which are poorly organized and lacks leadership. needs some revamp to the ranking system i think everyone agrees to this one training  well there is none in my opinion ur just winging it young engineers are expected to be politicians and you know what funny money is early on i like to be the innovator so you can play monopoly in the corner by yourself. realized that most people die two years after retiring if you work at a plant like i do...uhh not a happy thought,Exxon Mobil
707,large bureaucracy no room for any creativity,1.0,the compensation is decent. thats about it.,does not inspire any creativity huge bureaucracy no fairness to the ranking system. performance review will be based on how much you kiss up to your boss.,Exxon Mobil
708,i like my job.,4.0,exxon is a great company to work for in terms of available experiances. they have operations worldwide and in most cases you get to go to the location you work on. i also feel like my work is meaningful. i get to directly track how it affects the bottom line.,the downside of exxon is their annual employee assesment process. they rank all of their employees and assign you to a bucket middle low or upper. while this is a benfit in my mind because it give direct feedback on your performance the process acts like more of black box because you are unaware of who the individuals are that are number 1 and what they do differtent to get there. i feel like a lot of politics play in to it at some point.,Exxon Mobil
709,still at the top but for how long,4.0,competitive salary and excellent benifets pride for working for the leader in its industry,you have to have connections within some may be most supervisor have no degrees and don.t have much respect to degreed employees. company spends too much money for less outcome sometimes,Exxon Mobil
710,great place to work has its downsides but everywhere does,4.0,great compensation and benefits package great place for longterm career especially because their retirement benefits are out of this world its such a big corporation that you could start your career doing one thing and end up doing something totally different you move jobs every couple of years so if you end up in a position you dont realy like you know that it will only be for a few years at most,not all managers are sold on the corporate policies that they use to recruit i.e. worklife balance service opportunities safety but some really are  its kind of the luck of the draw. upside is you can move around a lot.,Exxon Mobil
711,great place to work long term,4.0,one of the best reasons is that i never have to worry about being laid off. they have a fantastic benefits package. it blows everyone elses benefits out of the water. and their retirement package is amazing. its easy to retire a millionaire from here...even the little guys.,managers are not all on the same page. some people have a fantastic manager open to new ideas but others have an old set in their ways manager.,Exxon Mobil
712,the benefits outweigh the minor annoyances.,4.0,as most profitable public company in the world it is an extremely stable company. if you do your job well you dont have to worry about losing it. this company is not going to go out of business. the compensation is very fair starting out and raises typically are greater than inflation and the market. the full benefits package is excellent as exxonmobil is one of the few companies still giving a pension. as a huge company you can do many different jobs in many different places in the world without changing employers i.e. maintain your seniority vesting vacation etc..,there is no job posting system. you have some input into what kind of job you would like to do next however management frequently decides for you what your next assignment will be.,Exxon Mobil
713,if you fit youre it,3.0,stability stability stability. great place to be in this economy. were a dinosaur and move slowly but steadily. these days that is a real bonus great coworkers  cohesive group of bright people. makes for a good workday.,only place that can hire 10 nobel laureates and fire 2 by the end of 10 years or so the story goes . . . it is tough to compete and deal with the rating and ranking system in some regards. most employees have never been average before and that can be quite tough. also xom is one size fits all  if you dont fit in leave quickly.,Exxon Mobil
714,decent company,4.0,compensation and benefits are probably the best reasons to work for exxon. it is a company that takes things in a very processoriented fashion slow and steady and you are encouraged to do your homework before pursuing an idea.,beauracracy  too much paperwork hoops etc. maybe this is expected from most big companies but sometimes it seems that it impedes your ability to work.,Exxon Mobil
715,solid company with excellent opportunity and compensation needs longer assignments for managers.,4.0,career advancement opportunities are everywhere. total compensation is outstanding. in my specialty work is usually valued and sometimes even interesting.,people are moved through different positions too quickly in many cases which leads to a lack of depth when dealing with others in the company. however the people in the company seem to be better than average so that is not always as bad as it would be at some companies. because of the rapid moves in management people are not in a position long enough to be held responsible for bad longterm decisions which has led to shortterm management thinking.,Exxon Mobil
716,best place to work period.,5.0,great career opportunties and benefits package has company paid pension and great 401k match100. very bright co workers who push you hard with their high achievcement and performance levels. senior mangement is outstanding. has consistently held long term values ethics career orientation etc that do not change over time. does not blow in the wind or chase the lastest fads as many companies do. stands by its principles when others adjust to political pressures or the fad of the month. bases investment decisions on long term not short term radical ups and downs in price of crude or product. over my career had work in engineering finance real estate it hr procurment so they move you to different areas like no one else. outstanding ethics and process orientation and conservative values like little debt that keep this company on top of decades not merely years as most manage to stay on top. high technology work despite what some assume about this industry. great pride in having a career here.,lean staffing means all work hard and somewhat long hours but that is why they can afford the benefits they pay lean staffing in good times and bad. hard charging leaders with high expectations along with high achieving employees means you work hard to get on top but the satisfaction is there. even lower performers work hard out of pride in their work and a carry over from top grades in school. so they are able to get critical jobs done with lean staff. key challenge is demographics as for all oil companies limited hirin in the 80s when oil did not offer good career prospects as now.,Exxon Mobil
717,good company,4.0,this is a good stable company that takes time to make the decisions count. hear so much criticism about oil companies but i see other companies that are far worse and so much less progressive yes even compared to exxonmobil. i can say that i am not proud of the past reputation of the company but the strategy looking forward is what truly counts now. the community partnerships are valuable and get so little recognition. i have to say that there are some truly great things that exxon is involved in that do not get the recognition it deserves.,very easy to get lost in the shuffle of such a large company and you really have to prove your mettle to get advances and promotions due to the competition.,Exxon Mobil
718,slow and steady.,4.0,stable well compensated career. high caliber of coworkers. incredible training and profesional development opportunities. size of the investments  decisions even new employees are involved in shaping.,too many levels of management approval needed to move forward. very slow paced decision making. checklist for everything. not inovative.,Exxon Mobil
719,the best company to work for.....come stay and retire here.,4.0,pay and benefit are one of the best 401k andplus pension plan. work is not back breaking very relax no pressure. fun to work. lots of overtime. management care for everyones safety safety being their first priority then our environment. no slowdown or employee layoff. layoff is a word that is not in their vocabulary. a lot of employee give aways gifts and rewards for being safe quarterly luncheons and offsite team building get together. they provide yearly supply of work uniforms. i dont need to buy my own work clothes yearly supply of work boots. i can order any hand tools power tools measuring tools and equipment that i need for the job. regular supplies of coffee creamer drinking bottled water refreshing gatorade soda cans all year round especcially during the summer.,i started working when i was 15 years old for a lot of small and big companies and i can not think of any downsides of working for exxonmobil. like any other companies they are not perfect and these are not considered downside of working at exxonmobil,Exxon Mobil
720,great opportunities high expectations,4.0,great opportunities both international and domestic. it is truly a global organization no matter what your interests or abilities there will be some place in the organization that is a fit. because of the global scope of activities there is an opportunity to gain exposure to an incredibly wide range of technologies and operations. oh and the compensation and benefits are outstanding.,the internal processes and controls can sometimes become overwhelmingfrustrating however there are usually good reasons for most of them. because the organization is so very large it can be difficult to identify who the right individuals are to address an issue or problem. and there is no internal job postings board moves are worked between the employee and their supervisor.,Exxon Mobil
721,work because moneyneeds not passion,4.0,great benefits package. cost of living in houston is low but exxon pay is quite competitive compare to other major cities. some opportunities for international assigment as exxon is truely a global company unlike cisco att ...who merly subcontraced the local vendor to perform the work on the behalf of the companies. top 10 performerrank groups raises are quite significant compare to the rest of the rank group. flexible with worklife balance ... not as flexible as other tech companies with programs like telecomuting friday earned day off flex schedule. take good care of employees during disaster before ike ... released employees early wednesday morning so they can attend to emergency preparationneeds... then after ike ....interest free loan excused time with pay to deal with insurance companies offer limited use of companys car ...etc....,very conservative company. lots and lots of politics. process oriented. no innovation  little creativity. technology adapters not inventors. forced ranking. no bonus rarely  very insignificant in it organization. heavy on security and control.,Exxon Mobil
722,welcome to the good life,5.0,the long term strategy for exxon has provided continual growth opportunities for employees. the benefits package is the best i have ever seen and the pay is incredible. this is a company that has posted record profit and has taken care of its employees accordingly. the cost of living in texas is very cheap. there are international opportunities to work abroad and they even give you a massive bonus sometimes if youre going to a remote region in the world.,very conservative company that lacks innovation. the company is very top heavy with many employees being there 25 years already.,Exxon Mobil
723,its okay for business,4.0,benefits experience great opportunities to learn business negotiations and problem solving techniques. sales allow for lots of travel with good expense support. if one does not mind regimantaton this is a great place to be. it pernits access to businesses of all shapes and sizes especially when in a psn of sales solicitation,large bureacracy w relatively little flexibility and large amount of conytol processes. the company is great for assigning the first two entry positions but then after that its extremely difficult to move on even when rated especially high. its a great place to work for 56 years then its importsnt to consider other companies.,Exxon Mobil
724,the company will continue to be profitable under rex tillerson.,1.0,the company is well known  its the largest publicly traded company in the world. the name carries a lot of weight to other potential employers.,company culture is very rigid its a good ol boys network. it never was about what you know its about who you know...company is lacking in diversity.,Exxon Mobil
725,exxon is a great place to work if you can manage your expectations.,4.0,corporate training center is on our campus which presents the opportunity to learn as much as you want to. the work environment is very universitylike taking time to think read research is encouraged.,the corporate culture is stiff not very warm and fuzzy. exxon prides itself on being very methodical with a long time frame for success. this can be frustrating for those who like a more dynamic environment. technical staff the lab workers do the heavy lifting but are not on the radar screen as far as management is concerned.,Exxon Mobil
726,inside perspective on exxonmobil,5.0,good compensation excellent leadership opportunities and excellent opportunities for international travel. i have found my work very interesting and worthwhile. additionally the current demographics of the company give alot of future opportunities for advancement. i am excited to working at exxonmobil and the career possibilities it will give me.,work life balance isnt the best but exxonmobil is full of smart people who keep pushing the limits on how much they can they can achieve. compared to my peers i work more hours then them but i am also paid quite a bit more then them. exxonmobil is a conservative risk adverse company that doesnt move very quickly but also wont be laying anyone off any time soon either. down or up this company will be constant and look long term.,Exxon Mobil
727,sound business philosophy,5.0,good pay with great opportunities for advancement. many high levels positions will be left vacant in the coming years as the baby boomer generation retires making them available for those of us moving up in the company. supervisors have always been great about allowing leave to take care of personal matters.,travel requirements for high level advancement although undertsandable can put a strain on family life. this is especially hard if your spouse has a good career in a different industry. depending on where you are located and the assignment you are in it can be tough to be noticed by people higher up in the company because it is so large. this really forces you to try and come up with new innnovative ways to accomplish things and get that recignition most people are looking for.,Exxon Mobil
728,an apprentices perspective of exxonmobil.,5.0,great people fantastic compensation. the group i worked with were very helpful intelligent and fun. overall i spent a great deal of time learning the corporate culture and studying the oil and gas field. after i had completed this startup phase i found the work very rewarding. i enjoyed my team very much as they were competent and reliable.,large company means a great deal of corporate structure to work with. takes some time to get up to speed and this may be disconcerting at first but over time your production will normalize and the experience becomes much more pleasurable. the company is committed to employee development and they offer tuition reimbursement and extensive training throughout your career.,Exxon Mobil
729,plan to work 70 hours a week as a manger and get no appreciation for your contribution.,2.0,the pay is competitive within the marketplace.,they look at every employee including long term employees as replaceable. all they care about is how much work they can get out of you for the least amount of compensation.,Exxon Mobil
730,good place to work if you are ranked well and dont mind a lack of a worklife balance.,2.0,excellent salaries able to work with very intelligent coworkers opportunities for travel and multiple career paths great opportunities and compensation if you rank highly compared to your peers.,personnel system is abysmal. the company uses a very archaic method of evaluating employee performance based upon intangible parameters. too much responsibility and power for shaping employees career paths is given to management with too little communication with employees as to where they see themselves moving in the company. an hr representative told me that 50 of new hires in the company leave within their first 5 years. also management is often more concerned with shortterm goals and their own performance rankings rather than providing leadership and support to their subordinates or thinking about the future of the company.,Exxon Mobil
731,outstanding opportunities,5.0,you work with brilliant people and you have incredible opportunities to develop. you are rotated around to ensure full development.,there are huge bureaucratic procedures that you must put up with as any large company has.,Exxon Mobil
732,great people to work with okay people to work for.,4.0,you are surrounded by incredible people every day.,very few managers are leaders. the rating and ranking system is hopelessly broken and noone in management wants to admit it. the it department is much more of a hindrance than a help.,Exxon Mobil
733,exxonmobil doesnt have a clue because it only listens and promotes people that drink the koolaid.,2.0,well paid flexibility in workplace which means you can go to the doctor when you need to but you have to get extra special permission to work from home even when fuel prices are over 4 per gallon solid security and control measures. global work and workplace opportunities.,clandestine management decisions including career choices command and controlstyle management inconsistency we need new ideas but cant get beyond year2000 thinking lowlevel leadership panics due to overbearing and outoftouch senior management lack of vision lack of stated goals lack of communication management immune from hearing feedback from employees due to forced ranking conducted by supervisors needing the feedback that determines ones employment status from year to year  because retribution is always a possibility despite the controlled nature of the process.,Exxon Mobil
734,the very best company.,1.0,if you want to die at early age xom will be your top choice. good benefits and salary without bonus. you can get some safety bucks and some free lunch if you are in research and development department.,none if you like to work harder than others. the company has force ranking system. feedbacks from high level engineers are very subjective. in the ranking season everyone is trying to show off in meeting. it is always the best strategy that you brining up very simple data and draw a straight line that can easily understood by the management and most of the audience. there is no 980 schedule and everyone works at least nine hours to impress their boss.,Exxon Mobil
735,a good solid place to work.,4.0,strong ethics good people and opportunities for growth. no matter what you do if you feel that a situation is wrong management is good about making sure that everything conducted is done with high ethics.,not much fun. you may feel like you dont contribute a lot due to the size of the company. there may be several people on your team but sometimes the problems you face seem so minor. since its a huge company change takes forever as well.,Exxon Mobil
736,exxon review,3.0,i felt i got the most incredible education at exxonmobil. i feel like i have a better businessmanagement education than i could have ever received at harvard and i was paid for it,a lot of work gets done at exxon based on who you know. in my evaluations i competed against people who worked 2025 years at exxon. i didnt know a soul who had a position of responsibility under the age of 45. dont expect a promotion for 5 years. i am not talking about the lateral moves or a move to team lead. expect a lot of them.,Exxon Mobil
737,great place to launch your career but dont stay too long,3.0,lots of different job experiences and opportunities for personal development. they have good training programs and you can move into areas of great responsibility without a lot of prior work experience. very good pay work life balance in most positions and great benefits.,company is very regimented but not as stuffy as its reputation. there is a company process for everything and not open to variance. management holds all the cards a lot of things are done in secrecy and you depend on your manager to be your advocate. opportunities are created for those deemed to be stars. everybody else has to make their own way.,Exxon Mobil
738,no real complaints here...,4.0,the security of working for a big company is pretty nice. i dont worry that exxonmobil wont be around tomorrow. there is an emphasis on worklife balance at least in my division  others may not be as lucky.,its easy to get lost in the huge corporate jungle in such a large company. there is a lot of red tape associated with working there. a simple request takes daysweeks to get approval up and down the line. there are two reactions when you tell someone you work for evil big oil  they hate it or love it  there is no in between.,Exxon Mobil
739,exxon is exxon the best,4.0,exxon is exxon the best. want to work for the best and be scene as the best join exxon. exxon has a large it organization and plenty of defferent challegs to tackle. with above average pay and long term mindset exxon will make a great employer.,exxon has a very strong culture. if you cant figure it out you can not maneuver. a lot of people will complain about exxon but you will find the same thing at other companies. exxon has a tough system but it works. our success over the years shows this.,Exxon Mobil
740,good people good company but how many oil company jokes do you know,4.0,i found the people to very competent and kind but the workforce is older and there is less social interaction than i have found elsewhere. pay and benefits are good and the near term looks good 100 barrels of oil sure help keep profits over 10b a quarter. the opportunities to work international are available albeit in some less desirable places far eastern russia or nigeria being two examples. the small perks of the job were nice  great meals when the company took employees out car service good hotels etc etc  all the things that make business travel more enjoyable.,the workforce is older and thus younger employees might less people to mix with on a casual basis. additionally exxon is very traditional company in terms of structure and management style. very clear organizational chart lines let you know where you stand. promotions seem to be based less on employee formally expressing an interest or applying to internal positions and more about the senior leadership deciding when you are ready and where you should go  whether you initiate or desire that move is not a high priority. finally those that want to enter upper management will probably have a rotation at a refinery which is not the most desirable place to spend two years.,Exxon Mobil
741,solid workplace  great compensation,5.0,stability and great experience. with such a large company there are vast opportunities to work in a variety of places around the world. also communication and collaboration is very impressive with such a large company.,it is a very slim and trim operation. theres a reason why it consistantly makes a great profit than similar comapnies because of disciplined management. so the perks and fringe benefits you might see at smaller companies are not here. also because it is the biggest and most profitable it is also the most hated and everyone likes to put its sights on the company. there are no official 980s but the flex schedule program is a good if not better surrogate which allows for very very flexible work hours. the flex schedule is probably a greater advantage to employees with families and children but is still very useful to single employees.,Exxon Mobil
742,strong financials horrible culture for employees,2.0,exxon provides a very disciplined approach to managing corporate direction and thus is relatively stable. in general the pension and 401k are hard to beat benefits. you have an opportunity to work on some of the largest projects in the world.,exxon is not an innovator and requires its engineers be bureaucrats rather than solve problems. work and culture are abysmal environments based on fear and punishment. security and controls drive every aspect of daily business and money is wasted for this purpose. its approach to diversity and inclusion is an embarrassment. exxonmobil does not branch out in the way it approaches todays energy challenges  the only card they are willing to play is oil. no investigation in solar wind biofuels etc.,Exxon Mobil
743,dont expect fun but do expect a good place to work hard.,4.0,great pay great benefits combined with some of the best training in the industry makes this a great place for people who are looking for a good stepping stone into the industry or a very serious very competitive environment. opportunities are always available at exxonmobil but you must take the initiative do not expect someone else to promote yourself.,this is work not fun and you know it at exxonmobil. do not think that you will work here and find a social haven. also exxonmobil does not offer many of the more youth oriented perks that competitors do like the 980 work week or a large amount of base vacation time.,Exxon Mobil
744,if you are results oriented disciplined and highly motivated you can make a great career at exxonmobil.,5.0,highly ethical company results oriented great benefits working with worldclass colleagues worklife balance is emphasized.,having to work in houston,Exxon Mobil
745,good disciplined company,4.0,exxon mobil provides global career and development opportunities that small companies cannot compete with. global travel opportunities are tremendous. the company operates efficiently and effectively in a responsible manner. exxon mobil also treats its employees with respect and encourages volunteerism and community involvement. over the past several years exxon mobil has also improved its focus on promoting a positive work life balance. in general exxon mobil is a good company to work for.,exxon mobils disciplined environment while often an advantage can sometimes stifle creativity and new ideas. the employee ranking system has some benefits but can make the workplace overly competitive and political this sometimes results in losing or disenfranchising talented employees.,Exxon Mobil
746,not a very people friendly company,3.0,the best reason to work for exxon is stability. for the permanent employees there is not a significant risk of being laid off even in an economic downturn. if you are picked as one of the golden children which not many are there is a monetary reward in that your salary will far out pace your peers. there are opprotunites to work outside of the us for someone who wants to see the world. there is an advantage a good support structure for young employees to learn quickly from many mentors but in about five years almost all those mentors are going to retire.,there are downsides to working for any large corporation but they are blatantly clear in exxon. the corporation is very slow change to meet the changing priorities of the younger employees. a forced ranking system is in effect for all professional employees which breeds discontent as even if an employee is performing at a very high level the employee can still be ranked at the very bottom....and being ranked at the very bottom means that salary increases are less and less frequent. as far as i can tell people in the bottom 20 get raises about every 20  22 months at the rate of of inflation if not less. the company does not offer an alternate work schedule and management will not even entertain the idea for their professional employees. the overall culture of exxon breeds managers who place morale very low on the priority list and treats the employees as if they were interchangable with anyone off the street. there also does not seem to be any clue about family and work balance. if by chance a people friendly manager does come about that person typically ends up in low middle management and does not go farther than that.,Exxon Mobil
747,the grass is always greener.,4.0,career advancement is key young engineers are given a lot of opportunity to advance. global presence is obvious but the technical teams tend to form small families so you really get to know the experts in the entire world. job security is high and salary is ok. morale can swing but most times they are good. safety is always something to keep in mind but the industry understands how to run the business. in the end a good place to work for young folks worse case you can always good to another company after exxon has trained you up. thanks.,red tape public perception of the company.,Exxon Mobil
748,why work harder for less,2.0,decent opportunity for international work. especially great if your life long desire is to live in nigeria.,40 billion profityear is apparently not enough to pay bonuses. on top of that the salaries are not competitive with other oil companies. its an embarassment. people that work at exxon are sheep. i cant wait to leave.,Exxon Mobil
749,still young but this is my opinion.,3.0,pay seems to be the best for chemical industry. seems to have a high level of investment performance when compared to most competitors. if you are ranked highly you will be well taken care of.,seems to be the red headed step child of exxonmobil. upstream is clealry where the money is mostly made and where everyone wants to be. seeems difficult to make a move from chemicals to upstream. refining even seems more respected than chemicals. ranking system is very subjective and tends to not be based on anything quantifiable. career development is handled totally by management and not by the individual. there are no posting of jobs for professionals. all job moves are handled internally through your supervisor so relationship with himher is very important.,Exxon Mobil
750,as quoted in fortune not a fun place to work,2.0,the benefits and stability of the company give a feeling of security. salaries tend to be on par with similar jobs in the industry. depending on the job function and the individual opportunities are available to take numerous assignments in a relatively short period of time. i have been impressed by the quality of my peers and a general willingness to help  more experienced employees are happy to share their knowledge and often serve as informal mentors. certain areas of the company seem to genuinely encourage a healthy work  life balance while others are making an effort to move toward a more flexible and employeefriendly workplace.,employee morale is generally low. formal feedback tends to be vague and lags behind by over a year making it difficult to improve in rankings. career development is often dependent upon the direct supervisor who may or may not make an effort to provide growth opportunities such as training or special assignments. senior management is far removed from the entry or midlevel employee and communication regarding goals and objectives are often contradicted as it moves down through the layers of management. younger employees feel unheard not respected and often taken for granted. in recent years a number of employees have left the company for a competitor  not for a new position or even better pay  benefits. they simply found that they were treated better.,Exxon Mobil
751,secure and predictable,2.0,exxon is at present a stable company with solid benefits. there are locations in many different areas and if you are willing to move you will likely get the opportunity to do so. there are opportunities to move between the different business divisions chemicals refining lubes pipeline ep in order to develop a well rounded employee however unless you are tagged early as a rising star or top performer opportunities may be limited. the stock match of 7 for our 6 is a nice perk. if you are extremely aggressive in self marketing or like sucking up its a great place to advance.,forced rankings mean the suckups usually out perform the competent hard workers. much of the culture is the holdover from exxon more so than mobil. exxon is a very engineering lead company and therefore views people as resources rather than assets to be invested in. supervisors are asked to evaluate their employees potential when they are first hired in. depending on your supervisors first impression your 30 year career growth potential can be severely stifled by one bad review. there are many supervisors and managers that are victims of the peter principle and are now in the level of their incompetence with no opportunity to move any further until they retire.,Exxon Mobil
752,mixed feelings but lots of opportunity for different experiences if you can put up with the red tape,2.0,global company with lots of opportunity to learn. excellent pay and benefits especially for those who perform and are ranked well. depending on where you work great opportunity for international experience. name looks good on a resume.,oppressive culture. ranking system is skewed towards those who are younger and isnt truly relflective of performance and contribution. senior managers are just that managers not leaders. information is shared on a need to know basis. little regard for employee engagement. worklife balance issues are pervasive due to global structure of the company. hr function should be role model for the company but yet isnt.,Exxon Mobil
753,with big opportunities come big bureaucracies.,4.0,the size and scope of exxons operations make the opportunities to work on leading edge technologies unparallelled. compensation is generally very competitive with the aim for salaries to fall into the top 25 of comparable jobs in industry. with the strong financial performance in the past couple of years most projects will move forward with cost not being a big obstacle. the international aspects of the work can often be very fascinating. many projects involve bringing together employees from around the world to accomplish global technology deployments.,the size of the company and the obscene number of levels of management often make it incredibly difficult to get even seemingly simple tasks accomplished. the ranking system where all employees in a group are ranked from best to worst can often be very political and in a group where all of the members are strong performers inevitably there are staff who,Exxon Mobil
754,exxon abuses the capability of employees,2.0,it is a wellrun company and very stable. assuming your skills remain in demand a job with this compan should be verrrrry long term.,the companys philosophy regarding talent is to hire the most exceptional folks and to ask them to do the work of two or three people. be prepared to work long and thankless hours.,Exxon Mobil
755,if you are dynamic intelligent and results oriented dont go to exxonmobil.,1.0,hr does a great job in providing golden handcuffs to experienced employees. benefits pension plan 401k are pretty good and the job seems safe right now.,career path is predetermined before you start working there. excellent work performance does not give you any recognition. only if management really likes somebody because of a nice smile or the ability to endlessly talk smoothly that person will get a series of easy tasks to accomplish and that leads to promotions and recognition.,Exxon Mobil

972,not what it is portrayed,2.0,relatively good pay thats all about it,working as a contractor or as they called it hat contractor for exxonmobil esso australia is like working in the us during the slavery period. you are an outsider they dont say hello to you they dont share any data with you. you are a paid labourer and just a number. no plan or vision they just make things up as they go. they hire you and dont listen. technically poor people only waste money.,Exxon Mobil

978,credit analyst,1.0,next to none if you hold an above average degree and are not looking for a dead end job.,salary salary is below market average and will not allow you to live comfortably. you will have two choices get a room along with other random people kinda like college or get a very very small apartment on the outskirts of prague btw once you leave the two blocks center of prague the city turns into a soviet wasteland made of popular housing grey buildings tagging along with neighbours and store clerks that do not speak a word of english. progression career progression is a dead slow bureaucratic process that is gonna lead you to a capped salary raise at less than 5 of your monthly earnings. so get ready to settle in with your czech roommates btw most roommates will require you to pay extra for guests that stay 3 days in your room  something to do with amortising the furniture and floor or just them not getting laid. benefits recruiters and line managers love to talk you about the great company benefits but i believe thats is just to convince themselves that they are actually not that bad. they are. discounts are low 510 gym is subpar not actually a gym just cardio massages and health benefits are available just twice a month. language classes for russian or croatian are a joke you actually need to be relatively conformable speaking either one to qualify  prior to admission you got to take a test. culture well if you are still reading i will let you know that i saved the best for last. since day one of your new job at exxonmobil you will be reminded at least 20 times a day about safety  of you see a puddle on the floor report it if you see someone opening a door to quickly let them know if someone walks too quickly in the hallway let them know it is not safe and so on. you will have realised this is just an interesting take on corporate bs only thing special is that most of the employees will actually believe what they are telling you is smart and not something you could have realised with the common sense of a 5yo. this should give you an idea on the type of people you will actually be working with. these leads me to the most important part of the review. the company treats this local office as a business support center as the name states a.k.a. a glorified callcenter. the people you will be working with and the career you will have here are the same you should expect if you were working in an actual call center. there is absolutely no connection in terms of career opportunities with the american headquarter so if you applied to this job with the intention of climbing exxonmobil corporate ladder give up and run away as fast as you can.,Exxon Mobil
