13,"""Decent retail environment, could stand improvement like most others.""",4.0,"The pay is on par with much of the retail world for the majority of staff. Management pay scales graduate nicely as one moves up in positions and responsibility. Depending on the management team at the store level, working can be reasonable and sometimes fun -- this is largely personality-driven. As most positions are public-facing, how one treats the customers will largely be reflected in how one receives treatment back. And while it is easier to post the negatives (see below), the positives certainly exist and make this retail environment better than some. Lowes does largely offer a wide variety of opportunities to the sufficiently self-motivated. It does take a self-motivated individual to excel, though. Retirement (401k), healthcare options (HDHP/HSA and traditional), dental, optical, long-term disability, life insurance, employee stock purchase programs, 10% employee purchase discount, paid sick leave, vacation and paid holiday (5) are all above-average extras for retail. Depending on one's schedule, an hour unpaid lunch and two 15 min paid breaks to a day. Most managers and supervisors work hard to accommodate unexpected life events and quality-of-life calendars with scheduling, 'though it is a retail hour rotation for many floor staff. And Lowes remains excellent in respecting both Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day by being closed. Finally, Lowes is a leader is respecting our military with 10% off for service members (abuse of this program has lead to ID checks to keep the dishonorable from cheating legit military). To be fair -- there is a LOT of criticism and shade thrown below. Marvin has only had 1.5 years to fix things, and some have been excellent. The mess his predecessor left is now his to resolve. So while he's not to blame for the past, he and his will be full on owners of what the future brings.","Staffing and 'raises' for the non-management population seems to follow the tired 1980s business management school mindset. There are no merit raises; store management will claim it is out of their hands. Everyone gets the same COLA until they cap out after x number of years. If store traffic is light, rather than use the staff to stock/clean/improve the store, management is encourages to 'cut hours' and send staff home as a meager cost savings. Customers will feel this effect immediately, with insufficient floor coverage and assistance. Not to mention most staff actually rely upon the paycheck to cover living expenses, and being forced off the clock immediately impacts their ability to live. This generates a negative feedback where the employee will be less motivated to support the store and customers -- such resentment is a logical result job being treated so marginally. A great example is during the holidays when, after annual attrition, permanent full or part-time positions are filled. The new staff enjoy some days or weeks on the floor, but find their hours drastically cut when toward the end of the holiday season, customer traffic meters down. Why would someone wish to take a part-time job for 20 hrs a week, and want to stay with a company when they say 'sorry, we only have 8 hours to offer you this week (or less)? How is it efficient or cost-effective to hire, then train, floor personnel, only to drive them away by shorting the hours. These individuals are being paid the lowest of their class (being new), and still require many hours of floor time to become competent in their assignments, tasks, and customer/staff support skills. They could be put to work in a hundred different ways that would support and improve the store and the customer experience. Seems the only lever corporate gives facilities managers is the 'cut hours' tool. All this really does is disappoint the 'fewer' customers that do shop with us. The dissatisfied customer leaves the store empty-handed and convinced they should have shopped somewhere else first. That's a lasting lost far more costly to the store than paying part-time staff some extra hours/wk. This is American retail -- not just Lowes. Dear Consumer -- is this what you want for your dirt-cheap products? Dear Stock Holder -- is this worth your quarterly numbers, or do you seek long-term success?",Lowe's

Rediculously too many required meetings and other work related training videos/apps to do which do nothing to improve efficiency or worker morale and waste a good 100-110 hours of time each week per store when you add all of the hours per employee that they waste on that nonsense. Not being harder on dealing with fraud type customers who come in only to create a scene for a lawsuit, bringing back returns years later and still accepting them, or allowing customers to publicly humiliate associates without defending them. Insurance costs a good 30%-40% more vs other corporations, despite having BCBS. Providing employees with garbage equipment from broken down ballymores, ladders, reach forklifts, and the new piece of junk box cutter which slows down productivity. Archaic computer system that is 20 years pasty its prime. and prevents communication between departments, receiving, front end, and management. No opportunity for advancement contrary to how much management says otherwise. Inventory is in total disaray and not organized at all, not to mention, top stock items (reserve or overflow items) have NO locations entered into any system so you are constantly having to hunt down items.

You are granted one weekend off every 8 weeks unless your needed or you have a medical schedule accommodation the you might never have a weekend off. (That’s what a manager told me when I asked about getting time for therapy and TMS). You are not guaranteed two day off in a row other than your weekend. We have no consistency in direction from mangers or on how things work. We will be told to put out the clearance product on a palate with a discount sign and then another manager will come over and make us put it back. They refuse to work it out between them. My ASM constantly gives us the wrong info about sales and promotions. He won’t listen to corrections from us. We need more staff to work safe and get things done. With all the layoffs and not replacing the people who have quit we are expected to just pick up the slack. Managers just tell us to work on our time management. If you need help in flooring with lifting, another associate, or managers most of the time customers just walk because no one came. We were having issues with a forklift; the load was up in the air and the back drive wheel stoped working. It took 20 minutes for the ASM to respond to our desperate calls for help. When he got to us the first thing he said was he was with a customer. Because the sale is worth more than our lives. Two weeks ago I was helping cut carpet. I was against the support as the carpet was coming down because the installer kept trying to do it himself. Right above me a roll of carpet came off and fell stopping just above my head. Managers responded quicker about 10 minutes after frantic repeated pages about the roller collapse. The ASM came over and right away started doing the spotlight meeting about my numbers. Making me do a roll play and asking me about credit apps. I almost died and that dose not matter. The only thing was how many credit apps I was going to put in. When ever we tell management about problems we’re having they tell us we are wrong or that we are not being positive. He told me I needed to find my own happiness when I talked about needing time for therapy. So I found my own happiness by leaving this company. We received almost no training. The company has a training program but due to lack of coverage I just ended up working. It’s learning threw trial and error and it’s so many people yelling at you until you get good at the job.

Lowe's consistently hires asms with no Lowe's experience to manage employees with 10+ years of it. When you apply for an asm position you get told that you don't have enough Lowe's experience, which brings me to my next point and that is that Lowe's will not promote from within unless you move to another store. They will never promote an hourly manager to salaried in the same store, so if you're looking to move up you better not have a family and you better be willing to move anywhere. The salaried managers are a joke in some stores and unlike Marvins claims, they are still hired because of who they know and it's clearly not based on experience or accomplishment.

Having worked for this company for the past 15 years, I can honestly say that Lowe's has fallen so far that it's pathetic. Compensation is terrible, not competitive with other companies. Work load is unrealistic and staffing is purposely kept low to achieve a budget that stays in the black. No regard is given to employees and what they have to face on a daily basis. Night work is not paid a night differential, even though it is the industry standard to pay an additional amount hourly for working overnight. Along with being locked in the building overnight and still having to clock out during our lunches, which is also irregular and to my mind... a future lawsuit waiting to happen. The new HR system that Lowe's has put into place is deplorable and run by people that are uninterested in answering any questions or doing their jobs to even research the specifics of the cases brought before them. There is no voice for the employees within the store anymore. This alone makes them prime for Unionization in the near future. Lowe's used to be a decent company to work for, but...today it is a dismal place to be used and taken advantage of. My time at this company is drawing to a close I feel, after giving them 15 years of my life I can honestly say I feel extremely used and taken for granted. All of the changes within the company over the past year and a half are only speeding up the deplorable work conditions and ultimately the bankruptcy of the company. The new management team of the company care nothing to pay their employees living wages and in fact go to some efforts to keep our wages as low as possible. Don't work here. Do yourself a huge favor and find a place to work that actually takes care of it's employees and pays them a wage they can actually survive on. Lowe's will most likely not be around within the next 5 years, they are so far behind the competition in regards to systems and management that when it happens it will be very fast. I for one won't feel sad about it, karma has a way of coming back... and in this case ... it's well deserved. Good riddance.",Lowe's

That guy is hands-down one of the hardest working individuals I have ever seen (I'm a Marine Corps Sgt. veteran).

They will want you to work for 9+ hours (usually more than 10) every day without taking a lunch break because you WILL be driving a box truck every day. You CAN take a lunch break, but this will ensure you spend even more time at work. Deliveries get over-booked and management will expect them all to be completed. Upper management will then get attitudes when you spend 12 hours on delivery with a ride-along from (insert random department here) who knows nothing about tools nor appliances, AND you don't finish all 13 stops.

There is a 4 step write up process that they completely ignore. One day you are getting recognized publicly for a fantastic job. 3 weeks later they quadruple step you and you are fired. Another coach was triple stepped. After being a nervous wreck for 51 weeks carrying the write-up, 1 week away from it being cleared they wrote him up for a minor paperwork issue that completely revolved around the outdated computer system crashing the last 2 hours of the shift. They are in a process now of eliminating the higher paid Coaches. If you are an older, higher paid coach they are targeting you. I showed up faithful and devoted each day, never called off, and gave my all everyday. Other coaches call off repeatedly, leave early all repeatedly without using their PTO time, don’t do their paperwork but yet are favored and never written up. Work life balance is incredible. This has the potential of being an incredible job. I have never been even close to being fired, never been written up but yet this last year has been the worst year of my life trying to hang onto a job that I loved. If you like having a 3-4 day weekend this is a great place to work but there is a price. The price is living on the edge and being targeted. You can and will be fired without warning. You could be setup for failure, trapped and then fired without warning. My advice is to act like you don’t care about your job, take long breaks, call off on your overtime days (that you don’t get paid for), come in late and don’t take the job if they offer you more than 55k a year cause you will be targeted.
