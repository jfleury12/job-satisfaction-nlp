Multiple potential career paths within the same company and usually supportive management that supports trying something new or different in the interest of your career. When market cycles are good, there is lots of positives with STIP (bonuses), more travel opportunities, training opportunities and more flexibility in R&D investments. Initially work/life balance was really a focus and felt valued by management.","Work environments were seen purely as a cost and so many facilities are outdated with dated equipment and no desire to shift any resources at addressing this. When market cycles are down, there is a massive negative shift in the work environment as STIP (bonuses) are all but cut which for most employees is a large contribution of their total compensation. Market down cycles result in business cases to justify everything from business trips, to simple equipment acquisitions and a lot of redundant budget churn multiple times a year in a large wasted effort of human capital to try and justify each line item. There has been a large shift in the view of the workforce over the 10+ year tenure with the company and employees are really viewed as a number and a cost to the bottom line. In downturns, workforce cuts are much more common and a lot more impersonal and quite devastating in the way they are executed. The shared 2 way street of loyalty between employee and the company feels a lot more like a one way street and as people were cut, the work/life balance was valued a lot less as the same output was expected from the remaining fewer employees. Top level management shifts have moved away from the life long, employee to a lot more external focused trying to find external leaders and lots of number crunchers who know less about the markets, dealers and customers and simply try and run the company by the numbers. This focus on external talent for top level leadership is causing a log jam as talent internally can't move up and the value of internally diverse, company built careers is lowering. Additionally, the increased focus on outsourcing jobs and contract work out was an alarming trend that was a short term P&L benefit but will have serious long term negatives.",Caterpillar

Has an open office culture and people are pretty friendly with one another. Opportunities for mentoring younger workers. Also can receive mentorship from more experienced workers. You can probably make an adequate paycheck. If living in a calm, family-oriented area is important to you, this would not be a horrible place to work. Understand though that it will take you your entire career to *possibly* make a healthy paycheck. The Champaign Simulation Center is a good place to work. I have a positive outlook for it. The company as a whole is wandering right now. Very cyclic. But the CSC is a decent place of employment. This is where it's at.

Structure of the upper leadership of the company is very bloated and superfluous. It was impossible to keep track of who all of the supervisors were. It was not entirely clear what half of them even did. They were just ""chief directing supervisor of supervising the undersecretary to the assistant manager of analytics."" EVERYTHING had an acronym, and the acronyms changed every month. Main hub of the company seems to be a swiftly tilting ship. Absolutely no stability. I think I worked for three different divisions in the course of three or so months. ""Diversity"" was valued over competence. I come from a pretty diverse family (father born in Polynesia, have black, Japanese, Filipino, Cherokee relatives). I have lived in a number of places in the US and Asia. I would consider myself somewhat liberal in social matters. But I still expect higher leadership to actually know what is going on, not just be a good face to look at. I'm not sure I saw that here. Very little motivation to work for the cause of the company as a whole. You have a 50-50 chance of being laid off no matter what happens, so it's not like the employees actually feel Caterpillar has their back. Pay is not amazing. It's okay. You will not be poor. But you will have to value location over paycheck. I know of a good number of people who leave Caterpillar just because the pay does not overcome the deep bureaucracy and tumultuous position of the company.

It took some looking, but I was able to find great leaders (usually lower level) and work with them as much as possible because they cared, championed, and enabled the people around them. For an entry level graduate engineer, the compensation and broad experiences were great. Finally due to the nature of the age of the corporation their is ripe opportunity to bring new perspectives and technologies to the production and equipment technology in use. If you can bring a new technique to the corporation, you can easily make a name for yourself and become an expert.","The more I was exposed to higher leadership (primarily in research and production), the more I was surprised and somewhat disheartened by a lack of cohesive vision for the company. The corporation acts more like a loosely connected coalition of business units and divisions, rather than a singular brand. This seemed to have the effect of: a diluted vision, decoupled responsibilities, a variety of confusing and thick middle management layers, slow responses to change, duplicated efforts, and a lack of focus on internal and external customers. It feels like programs and changes intended to engage and empower employees (like innovation, strategy, and customer advocacy and experience) end up being fads rather than deep cultural investments. Finally, I will say that the corporate culture has the, I believe unintended effect, of making the definition of 'leadership' equal to one who takes great political and career affecting risk to see some goal accomplished. Whereas I believe the best leaders I've experienced have 1) a strong vision that invigorates and invites people with a variety of skills, 2) the courage to enable those motivated workers to execute their talents to the quality they wish to reflect their reputation and integrity, and 3) the strength to defend their teams when budgets get tight or development gets challenging.",Caterpillar

Financially well-managed and conservative approach.,"Work/life balance was a myth. Management-level employees were compensated well but expected to live for the company. Culture is stodgy, resistant to change and slow to adopt new ways of thinking, collaborating, and communicating. Post 2008 crash, experience was costly and cut from the company, resulting in great disservice to its future. Benefits not what they used to be, but that's typical of corporations everywhere. A bit Big-Brotherish.",Caterpillar

You will be surrounded by men everywhere you go, most of them with large egos and lazy work ethics. Bright, intelligent women are looked over for those who either look nice or don't truly speak their mind. You have to play ""the game"" to get anywhere you can make a difference, and nobody really makes a personal difference in their employee's lives because it is all about the bottom line.

Been through multiple ""economic downturns"" with this company, and every single time, the shareholder's made profit. While the employees were terminated, laid off, had perks removed, had promotions and raises denied, work load increased, and all while creating wealth for the shareholders. It takes having the job market put pressure on finding available employees and current employees begin leaving for better before CAT eventually begins to notice. Promotions are rare, relatively speaking, and raises are mostly minimal.",Caterpillar
