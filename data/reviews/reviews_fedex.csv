If someone is ever so privileged to have the title ""manager"" they get to do even less. Zero communication, which leads to constant chaos and stress. No dress code, people often dress like it is a Friday night club. Zero professionalism all around. When corporate comes to visit, they send emails (to about half of the company) telling them to dress up and show up to work. The company was started by some frat brothers so you can imagine the atmosphere. People walk around the office with their speakerphones on, other times they yell at each other (carry conversations) across the room rather than get up and talk or email.

They take vehicles from station that some coffee dog in Memphis says the station doesn't need even though he/she doesn't have a friggin clue what the stations vehicle needs are. They put 2 wheel drive vehicles in parts of the country that need 4 wheel drive. Having 4 wheel drive vehicles is what separates us from the competition but upper management is too stupid to figure it out. The give us a raise and then raise our rates. They have a spending freeze so it's hard to get new uniforms. I've had the same shirts for a decade. If you are young and a hard worker and don't mind being stressed all the time Fedex is for you. You will learn to hate driving. I mean despise driving. Remember those weekend drives you took with your significant other? Say goodbye to them. You will not want to leave your home your days off. Christmas? Don't even get me started. You will come to hate your favorite holiday and will only put up with it for the sake of your kids. 20 years of my life wasted but they paid for my kids and my wife was able to be a stay home mom.

1884,"""Good Employer/depends on your management""",4.0,"Professional atmosphere. Depending on the management, you are not micro-managed; however you do have to communicate well and often the status of your projects as you would expect. If you have a capable manager you will thrive. Somewhat flexible on start and end times and lunch break if your circumstances need some flexibility. Some allow you to come in a little earlier than others and leave a little early or come in a little later and leave a little later as long as it overlaps what most consider a normal day. Pay and benefits are good though maybe not excellent. Still have an opportunity to move up or around in the company (though not as easy as it was at one time). If you get on a good team (good managers and co-workers) it is still a good place to work and I would recommend it.","True to most jobs, your manager and management team determines your success, or lack thereof, so pray for a good one! it is not as easy to move around in the company as it once was. Reorgs happen from time to time and can be ok or not depending on who you end up working for. Need to be good at office politics. Benefits are not as good as they once were but not sure how they compare with other companies. Out of pocket expenses can be high initially and for medical procedures. Pay is usually not as high because benefits were ONCE good enough to balance it out. Now that FedEx is so big and has been around so long the people philosophy it was founded on is not shown like it once was but it is still a good working environment for the most part. Incompetent managers look for scape goats but that's not something that just happens here....it can happen anywhere.",Fedex

(They have been hiring many people so they won't have to pay overtime). If you get $14/hr and you work 4 hours overtime everyday for a year, you can make 50k. Might be worth it for some people, definitely not for everyone.","It's basically a data entry job, don't let the title fool you. The pay is low, not a job for college graduates. There are around 30 other people doing the same thing as you so seniority is going to play a big role in promotions. They start you at around $14 or $15 per hour. And you get like 2% raise each year, so you do the math. You will have to put in 4+ years just to get $1 raise. There are other reviews here that proves it could be worse than the example i gave you. At these kind of pay, a single person cannot survive since rent alone is around $1,000 + utilities for a studio. This job is for kids living with parents or for people with a significant other that is making the big money. How does the company get away with paying so low? They hire minorities(some can't even speak proper English) who would otherwise have a hard time finding a job. If you are a white person, don't bother applying to Sr. Entry coordinator positions at the LA/Torrance (soon to move to Gardena) location because they have filled these low level jobs with minorities. Great move by the senior management at the HQ in Memphis. They can claim to be a equal opportunity employer saying they have this many minorities in the company and this many minorities in management. But if you look deeper into the company, you will see the minorities are at the very bottom in job level and pay. The higher you go, the whiter it gets. They have minorities in management positions at this LA locations, but these supervisor/managers are just puppets. They have no authority over anything. All the decisions are made in Memphis. Again, don't expect to come in a get a promotion anytime soon. Prepare to put in years at these wages since there are already many people in line ahead of you.",Fedex

We had to clean our own bathrooms and try to provide customer service to those who want to print things on their own. It's IMPOSSIBLE. - I remember being opening a store with my assistant manager and having 15+ people needing our assistance. Again. That is IMPOSSIBLE because we also provide print services. So we will have these long lines because we're working with customers that would require 15+ minutes of our time to assist them. Then we go and have to ship things for other customers. THEN we have to handle angry customers because they're waiting 30+ minutes just to buy a notebook. It's ridiculous and stressful and just. Ugh. It has been three years since I set foot to work in a Fedex store and it STILL was traumatic.

1983,"""Has it challenges but it's a fast growing company with opportunities.""",4.0,Company is always looking to improve life style which you get a incentive and bonuses during the peak season for working on Sundays.,Sometimes long hours and work on holidays depending on the volume for that week. Some upper managers are old school which your opinion doesn't matter.,Fedex
1984,"""Associate Analyst""",5.0,Company has provided extensive training and tools to help me become a better professional. Great benefits and fantastic tuition reimbursement program. Employer is great to provide flexible hours while getting your education.,"The pay is not the greatest. Pay increases are minimal. With a Bachelors degree and over 10+ years of experience, I'm getting ready to leave due to $39K a year. Not meeting my financial needs, but I will certainly miss the company.",Fedex
1985,"""Package Handler""",3.0,"Get paid every week, start earning PTO quickly",the hours are too early,Fedex
1986,"""Fedex Tech Connect Experience""",2.0,Great benefits and great co-workers,Some hourly positions do not pay very well.,Fedex
1987,"""Undervalued, monotonous work with okay benefits""",2.0,"The training is nice, but depending on the department you are going to, could be completely useless. Co-workers generally nice and helpful, though you may get in trouble for asking them questions on the floor, as management theory is that no one knows what they're doing. 3 weeks vacation, 10 sick and 6 floating holidays. When those benefits start depend on your hire month. You can go maybe 6 months without vacation, depending on your start date, but that is pretty normal.","Work is monotonous, as is most data entry, can't say it wasn't expected. Stressful to be both efficient (lots of files processed) and accurate (zero mistakes, even human error typos count against you). Little room for career advancement. Monthly reviews are meant to be helpful but come across as either punishment or an excuse to pile on extra work if you perform well for no extra benefits.",Fedex
1988,"""Indianapolis Hub""",4.0,Great benefits! Vacation is easy to schedule. Can get more hours,"Under-staffed, not enough employees to preform the tasks",Fedex
1989,"""Senior Express Clearance Operations Import Coordinator""",1.0,Pretty much impossible to get fired unless you are late or call in often. Above average paid time off.,"No room for advancement and if there is the work load is not worth advancing. No rewards for employees, everyone feels undervalued and over worked. They do not care about quality- only quantity- which is why Customs is constantly threatening to return to paper submission for FDA shipments and a lot of extra paperwork is now needed for USGR. In fact if Customs looked into shipments more they would see that customers are constantly providing tariffs with lower duty to save money. Accuracy is not a factor at all here. In 3 years I've gotten a total of 16 cents in raises- that's $332.80 more than what I was hired at- after 3 years of above average work. There is no motivation to be an exceptional employee. Most managers are lazy or mean and deserve to be fired. Health insurance is terrible.",Fedex
1990,"""Im a carrier driver""",5.0,Its ok pay in concord CA move up fast if you no how to use jcat. Excellent group of employees and managers. Health care.,Need more full-time routes and can uses a majer upgrade to their technology systems. Could use a higher top out for 5+ yr employees.,Fedex

1992,"""FedEx is not very considerate of their employees""",3.0,The team I worked with was great I enjoyed my time working with them.,They hired new employees after me that I would help train and I found out they started them off more than they were paying me and they didn't give me a raise I deserved. They also would not move me to part time after I had my baby who needed intense physical therapy.,Fedex
1993,"""It's decent income but not quite good and definitely not great""",3.0,Great benefits including discount travel and 401k match...not much else to say ummm nice uniforms and they're good for a reimbursement for safety shoes,"Not enough hours, favoritism, poor management skills, don't you dare get hurt on the job because the write off everything as preventable",Fedex
