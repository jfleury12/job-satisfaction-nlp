31,"""Great company""",5.0,This company treats their employees very well. It has been a while since I’ve worked their but I was employed their 10 years! It’s just that kind of company.,It is very difficult to move up the ladder unless you are in sales or near one of their cell cebter hubs.

Easily the most toxic environment I've ever been in. Constant reorgs, which leads to a general sense of shellshock.",Liberty Mutual
34,"""Analytics Development Program""",4.0,"I have plenty of good things to say about Liberty! Work from home 2 days per week, very competitive salary (Boston) , plentiful role mobility, career advancement opportunities, flex office space, learning opportunities, career growth, free coffee and tea, impressive maternity AND paternity paid leave (new 2019), 100% tuition reimbursement up to 9k per year after 12 months of service, young culture, ERGs (employee resource groups to encourage acceptance and diversity.. ex ""Pride at Liberty"" the LGBTQ+ group)","Flex time off- 15 days +3 personal holidays.. 18 days total to start. This wouldn't be bad if there was a separate bank for sick time. 18 days total off is not that competitive to attract top young professional talent. Consider moving that figure to 20+.. 15 day FTO accrual is very standard, but typically an employee would also get sick time. The commuter benefit is only ""pretax"" so basically no contribution from Liberty Mutual, which is a shame in an expensive city like Boston. The gym discounts for local gyms typically range from 10-30 dollars of per month, laughable considering most gyms in the area are a minimum of 100 month, most reaching upwards of 200 per month.",Liberty Mutual
35,"""Large tech ambition slowed down by company culture""",4.0,"The pay and benefits are top notch.

Not fair.,Liberty Mutual
38,"""There is No Liberty at Liberty""",1.0,"Benefits are good. HSA, 401K, Health and Dental are standard. Good perks and discounts. Co-workers are helpful and friendly.","Chronically understaffed, lack of departmental and interdepartmental communication, cumbersome procedures, archaic systems, useless practices. In summary this position is a waste of life. Interview: The process includes a phone interview and an in person double-teamed interview, both loaded with “name an example of a time…” meandering questions. Salary: The range is between $39K and $48K. Of course, they will try to offer you $39K. No one should do this job for less than $50K. Actually, no one should do this job, period. Well, maybe an evil robot. This is an hourly position, however with authorized and unauthorized overtime it will feel like a salaried position. Training: This is a honeymoon period in which you would have to travel (most likely to Boston) for 2 weeks. Then you will enjoy a slow-paced job shadowing and administrative tasks easy-peasy weeks before the job becomes a brain-eating amoeba. The Job: Involves attending useless meetings, getting 10-15 new claims daily, calling all parties and sifting through their lies because an accident is never anyone’s fault. Claim 1: “The Earth spun too fast that day and I lost control of the vehicle."" Claim 2: “When I saw my parked, unoccupied car get hit I got a hernia. I want a million dollars.” Claim 3: “My hamster, Pepe, was in the car and he was injured too.” Every other claim can be featured on an episode of CNBC’s American Greed. You deny a word vs word claim per the company's guidelines, but if a claimant barks loud enough, or has some power, management or the insured cave in and accept liability, making you look like an idiot. You could have saved weeks of insults and aggravation by simply accepting liability right away. Threats of bodily harm by claimants are not uncommon. Insureds act as if they own you. You are a secretary, personal doormat, complaint department operator and sometimes a claims adjuster. While some of these things are common in most insurance companies. Liberty does it worse. The job is extremely stressful. It is impossible to complete all tasks during the shift, but getting overtime is like pulling teeth on a demented shark. Some employees choose to work OT unpaid (which is illegal) and management looks the other way. Business plans, priorities, lower and upper management change drastically every 6 to 8 months in some sort of corporate three-legged musical chairs that leaves everyone disoriented and unstable. Guidelines are as unclear as Chicago parking signs, and are overruled the second the right dog barks too loud. Sales and underwriting live in Jupiter while here on Earth adjusters need to battle through coverage wars with insureds who always believe they purchased coverage for the Sears Tower even though they are paying premium to cover a bus stop. An accurate job description should be: ""Looking for argumentative person to battle gladiator style with customers"". In order to be successful you have to, not just be comfortable with conflict, you have to enjoy it. You have to get satisfaction out of being combative and argumentative like some prosecutors. Even if you enjoy conflict, without support from management this task is like showing up to a world war with a plastic fork. Pointless! Communications: You are expected to answer phone calls, mail, emails, and texts from customers, vendors, claimants, brokers and other carriers for your claims and other people’s claims. This sounds reasonable, except for the fact that Liberty is chronically understaffed constantly so the calls, emails, and texts flow like the freezing water that sunk the Titanic. It’s simply overwhelming to try to answer a hundred emails in 4 hours on top of working the 10-15 new claims you’ll get a day plus calls and meaningless huddles. Management Support: Standing dominoes on a Bosu ball during an earthquake are more stable than some managers. There’s a manager in particular who likes to call you into his office to see how much yelling your eardrums can take. A death metal band plays at a lower volume than his screams. Half of the office can hear him badgering employees. Health: Several people have dealt with work-related health issues throughout the years. Empty bottles of alcohol have been found in the bathroom from time to time. Panic attacks and anxiety are contagious like the common cold. Work-Life balance? Ha! There's a generous PTO bank. However, you'll spend your vacation panicking about what awaits when you return. FAQ: “Why didn’t you leave earlier?” Others and I kept waiting for it to get better but that is like being married to the bear in The Revenant and expecting the bear to not attack you. “It can’t be that bad! Are you exaggerating?” We are not. Ask about the turnover rate. Ask the person you job-shadow how many panic attacks they’ve had in the last six months. Ask them when was the last time they had a full night sleep…sober! Ask who’s not on a mental health medication due to the job. Ask the few lifers left, who have been there since the Y2K, how many managers they’ve had. It's more than the coaches the Chicago Bears have had. To add insult to life-threatening injury, with the right creamer, sewage water from Flint, MI tastes better than their free coffee.",Liberty Mutual

Turnover is relatively low compared to many jobs out there and in the industry. Most employees in my office have had 10+ years of experience in the field. Good job stability.

117,"""Software/Tech Work is Uninspiring and Purposeless""",2.0,- 37.5 hours a work week for salaried employees and decent time off (for a non tech company) - Relaxed company culture,"- Proliferation of bloated middle management with small-impact responsibilities leads to sometimes curious cases of creating B.S. work that inhibit the people under them in order to make them feel like they have a purpose - The three-year goal of “going Agile,” which as many developers suspected was largely lip service. Bloated and inefficient bureaucracies still exist with no change in sight, and middle management and directors either don’t care to “go Agile” or simply don’t grasp its core tenets - Pay is weak for tech jobs until you hit senior developer, at which point you’re scraping the bottom tier of what other companies pay their software developers - Promotions appear to be mostly time based and not on merit. Promotions have been so infrequent that the question floats up to senior leadership somewhat often, to just be dismissed - College grad employees are treated like long-term interns. Nothing is expected of them, they’re fed scraps for work, and the orientation appears to be extremely infantilizing - During town hall-type seminars, C.E.O. and senior leadership will dodge tough questions and manage to turn things thrown their way into nauseating self-congratulating pats on the back. The exception is James McGlennon, who can admit to the reality of things and give candid answers to hard questions - Company lacks clear leadership principles, as well as real leaders. Many of those in charge are leaders in name only, with check-the-box gray man managerial techniques. The case can be made that all companies are like this, but it’s especially poignant at Liberty Mutual in my experience - Workforce and institutional knowledge is being bludgeoned from people leaving the company, both willingly and through layoffs. The more motivated and competent people are leaving for better positions and pay, and the multiple cycles of layoffs happened to kick some of the most knowledgeable people out of key positions in departments. This mass brain drain absolutely stifled morale and work throughput - Health insurance has been getting much worse each year. Do not get sick",Liberty Mutual

They love promoting familiar faces over subject matter experts with proven experience. This has cost them and will continue to. -Some people promoted to levels that others are held down below due to politics and inconsistencies in how managers view promotions.

223,"""One of the best  - for an large, old, somewhat traditional company""",5.0,"I am later in my career and have spent about the last half of it here. What separates Liberty Mutual is a longer-term strategy and an honest aspiration to treat people with dignity and respect. There is still work to do and, as with any large company, there is too much variation in how particular areas may be managed. However the long term trend is clearly to become a better place to work and more effective organization for policyholders and agents. In particular, over the last 5 years I've seen a tremendous turnover both in leadership and in fundamental philosophy. Progressive HR practices (e.g. flexible work arrangements, relaxed dress code) have become the norm. There is a REAL Diversity and Inclusion effort that is well-supported and strategic (not just a training program or recruiting tool). The company has also adopted a Lean management practice that is being deployed throughout the company. In the case of IT, Agile development is being adopted along with other management practices that help bring the function into the 21st century. Expectations of managers, and how they are measured, has changed. All of these are efforts in the right direction. Progress is slow and there remain pockets of the company, either by role or function or geographic location, that are very difficult places to work. As a non-public company, Liberty has somewhat less pressure for short term results which helps the company make more long-term investments. If you look at the long-term trends for Liberty the company has continued to grow and do well through every economic turmoil over the last few decades. You can't do that if you are poorly managed. The bottom line: any large company will bring it's share of bureaucracy and other challenges. I also can't speak to what any particular employee experience will be like. This may not be for you. However if you are looking for place that is more likely than any other big company to treat you as a person, that is more likely to grow and offer long term opportunities, and is moving in the right direction, don't discount Liberty Mutual.","Well, it's a big company with a long heritage of top-down management. Average tenure of managers is long so this is where they learned to lead. So you might find yourself working in a department or for a manager that so do your due diligence. If you aspire to the high-tech start-up culture where you can come in with the new big idea and make a big splash rising quickly in the organization, well, you probably want to be careful. With the exception of a few innovation labs and small areas this is probably not the place for you. As a front-line employee or lower level manager expect to work in the system. As a higher-level leader expect to manage politics. This is not unusual for a big company or anyone in a risk-averse, highly regulated industry. But seems particularly important here that people come in, lay low and learn for awhile.

Over the last several years, Liberty has strived for a lean-like operation, going as far as branding its own management system; however, to date, it has only penetrated the facade of the business. Being a large company, it has wide footprints - mostly in the midwest and east coast, offering a range of opportunities to those that live in, or desire to move to those areas. Salaries are average.","Restructuring is a common practice, often displacing very talented people and creating very tall, bureaucratic configuration within the many SBUs. Learning opportunities can be frequent, but are often limited to the narrow track of business in a particular unit. Frontline management is primarily comprised of promoted technicians, giving rise to an ever increasing gap in fundamental managerial practices. Middle management seems to be caught between doing the right thing and heeding to the demands of the executives, often making promises they cannot keep and losing key personnel. Work/life balance has been a popular thought over the last few years, but it seemingly has only been achieved with lower pay grades within certain SBUs. While salaries are average, they are much lower than younger companies across different industries. Health benefits appear appropriate to such a large and mature company - limited and costly. The culture appears to be driven by the home office in Boston, with many of the regional offices carrying resentment for this aspect. Once pseudo-independent, regional offices prided themselves in making regional decisions, even if it was only on the surface. Restructuring and centralization has caused an increasing rift within Liberty. Employees are given and annual survey, seeking honest opinions about management, operations and pride in the company. While scores, as well as participation rates have increased over the years, so has interdepartmental competition, coaxing participation and offering rewards to those offices/departments that carry higher rates of participation.",Liberty Mutual

Claims is a nation-wide call center. Promotion throughout the company is based on likability and bringing the teacher an apple rather than tenure, numbers, or skill. Compensation is abysmal. Benefits are meh. Several branches exhibit sexism and ageism from upper management on a weekly basis; if you're male, good luck; if you're a female over 35, keep your resume updated. There is never a dearth of 22-year-old new-hires to take your place for less pay, so the high turnover is welcome because it saves the company money. Overall, LM tries to fix things that aren't broken to provide high-paying jobs for analysts. Feedback is solely survey-based, but some files are never even handled by you due to phone queues.

When visitors come to the call center or new agents hit the floor, you can be selected to have them sit with you and represent the company. Project and committee placements can also be had when you excel within your position. The company even provides time off to volunteer, but if you work in the call center, you must be one of the chosen few as to not have an effect on calls. Within benefits you can also earn up to an additional $600 per year via gift cards as long as you complete tasks for your health benefits. There is also a VIP bonus at the end of the first quarter of each year that, as long as you are there for a complete quarter the previous year, you can get.","There seems to be a reorganization email going out once a month, if not sooner. Supervisors are placed on the floor in Plano, TX before they even attend a formal training and are expected to operate like a tenured supervisor. Supervisors are also taken from the floor for numerous meetings and/or interviews which leaves the call center without leadership. A tenured agent is left ""in charge"", but they are not provided with any real authority and still wouldn't be able to take a ""supervisor call"". Progress and updates should be communicated in a way that agents will have time to understand. There is too much emphasis placed on how much time you are scheduled on the phone and not enough on making sure all of the agents are on the same page. This becomes apparent during huddles when having a discussion and your team has 4-5 different answers for the same problem. The 4-5 different answers are 4-5 different SOPs that have been in place. It really seems like the Plano center was just thrown together and supervision was put together afterwords.

Layoffs are common in Liberty Mutual, and there will be many more coming, especially as Liberty Mutual goes through the systems integration. Even if you are a top performer, Liberty Mutual does not take employee performance into consideration when laying off people. I have seen several top performing employees lose their jobs while the company decided to keep on terrible employees instead. It's extremely difficult to work in an environment when you are unsure if you would have a job within a month. - Highly incompetent upper management. The upper management at Liberty Mutual has made some extremely poor decisions over the past few years. For instance, laying off all of the customer service representatives in the field offices has done nothing but led to extended customer wait times and a big decline in customer service quality. Additionally, Liberty Mutual has invested way too much money in the energy sector which resulted in extremely large losses. The investment in Venezuela was a complete disaster as it cost the company nearly $1 billion. The managers also decided to jack up the prices for their policies in order to recover the losses they sustained, which leaves the company offering a very over-priced product that is not at all different from their competitors. - Extreme micromanagement - Liberty does not trust their customer service reps & claims agents. Every single detail is tracked and monitored by the supervisors. The micromanagement does not give the representatives the freedom to service the policyholders effectively, and it causes an enormous amount of stress. The micromanagement is so bad that Liberty Mutual tracks what time you go to the bathroom, and how long you spend in there. - No Work/Life Balance for claims, customer service, and sales. In claims and customer service, it is very, very difficult to get time off. Once, I was unable to get 2 hours off on a Tuesday to do go the dentist. The most common excuse Liberty gives you when you get denied time off is: ""Service levels don't support your request."" - Benefits keep getting worse - Each year, the company has cut the quality of their Health Insurance and 401k. Recently, Liberty Announced that they will be cutting the bonus for achieving insurance designations by 50%. Additionally, a few years ago, the pension plan was completely gutted. Usually, Liberty gives an incredibly lame excuse after the cut benefits. They like to say that they compare the benefits to the competitors, and make adjustments to be in line with the competition...this always results in much worse benefits. It won't be long before Liberty guts the tuition reimbursement and severance package.",Liberty Mutual

If you are seriously considering working here, take notice of the reviews, especially the one on recommending a friend to work here: There is a reason why this site is significant lower than the company as a whole. Like the other reviews state, the play the ""like"" game, and they will fire you if you're not liked. This site has an old-school mentality and they hire and fire without regard to cost, which is why they are always hiring. I was absolutely amazed. Out of my training class of 30, less than half made through a year. Life here also depends alot on the manager you get. Some are really good, others are not so good; it's quite the dichotomy-- and it shouldn't be, I believe. For example, my first manager was great. She was actually the one that hired me at my interview. She rewarded me constantly for all me efforts-- I have a huge stack of gift cards! My next manager was exactly the opposite. Never rewarded me even though I still met or exceeded all my metrics. In fact, during my last few weeks, I was being threatened with 30-day action plans and probation. This is also a place that treats workers like little kids. They micromanage annoyingly. If you want to use the restroom, you have to aux into a specific code-- and yes, going to the bathroom effects adherence. It's just an overall crappy place to work, in my opinion. The health benefits are not great either. With the current PPO plan, the $600 deductible has to be met before copays are applicable. In other words, general office visits are full price until the deductible is met then they go down to $20. There's also a $100 deductible on dental, but most dental plans suck anyways...",Liberty Mutual
401,"""Extremely Frustrating""",1.0,The benefits are really good.,"The metrics are impossible to meet and if you do meet one, they still hit you with a low score on your yearly review. There is almost no field staff anywhere, so you will be handling large damage amounts form the desk that really should be seen in person and then questioned on your decisions. The audit reviews are extremely opinion based. The vast majority of the department is always either on a coaching package, fired, or leaving at any given time. The work load is also ridiculous. I also don't feel like we behave with integrity and it seems like we just try to pay as little as possible.",Liberty Mutual
402,"""Not as Described""",3.0,"Pay, Benefits, Co Workers,",Customers/ Shareholders/ doctors/ injured parties all put up roadblocks and refuse to cooperate more often than no' things change constantly; remove helpful resources and make you feel guilty or dumb for reaching out; job security felt very lacking,Liberty Mutual

407,"""People oriented, high case loads""",3.0,They are people oriented and are going in the right direction with hiring a surplus of adjusters. Great area to transfer to corporate or another office.,Very high case loads. Their claim reviews get very knit-picky and is not consistent between managers. Most adjusters have to work beyond the 37.5 hr work week to try to even catch up but barely make a dent in their inbox.,Liberty Mutual
408,"""Agency Customer Service Representative""",4.0,Compensation. Medical and Dental benefits. 37.5 hour work week. Great co workers. Company philosophy was something I believe most anyone can get on board with.,Working on the phone taking back to back calls can really take it out of you. Promotions are often a foregone conclusion since management places their friends in position to advance.,Liberty Mutual
