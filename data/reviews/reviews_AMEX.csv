Although some things depend on what team you are in, my Pros apply to most of the company. Have not really seen bad culture/work life balance teams, but have heard of them through word of mouth. Great learning Financial Service opportunity without the hyper A Personality culture of the industry.","-PTO days do lack a little when starting as an Analyst. Due to the fact that holidays must be taken from your PTO totals. Also PTOs do not roll over or get paid out (You can buy PTOs and you get your money back if not used during the year). For me this balances out due to the work life balance I have. -Health insurance has a high deductible even when getting the most expensive (even then not too expensive if Single or Married). This does balance out by being offered a HSA which the company contributes a sum at beginning of each year (which depend on your doctor would cover your copays). -Layoffs and Reorgs. Like many companies you hear of layoffs and Reorgs which suck and it is a con. What many people do not tell you is that Layoffs usually occur at VP or higher levels and a Reorg usually gets a couple months notice and a package if you do not find anything. Again does not feel good if you end up in this situation (and hope I never have to be in it), but it is not like the movies where the same day you pack your things and go.",American Express

It because a sales job first, and customer service second. The supervisors didn't care about anything except sales, sales, sales. If a customer called in to dispute a charge, pay a bill, ask a question, the rep was expected to make a sale somewhere during the call. The metrics were impossible. Once Amex lost the Costco account, they were scrambling to keep customers. It was sad. I asked in my initial interview if this was a sales job, and was told it was not.

68,"""PTO could be better""",4.0,Flexible and focused on technology and customers. Great culture.,PTO is deceptive because the number of days they give also includes all holidays. So you are required to use PTO for any holiday. Other banks will give you about 20 days plus all federal observed holidays. That's around 27 days off per year.

If you have a great manager who actually cares about you enough to invest in you, appreciate your work, and want to see you succeed, that can make all the difference.","I genuinely have no idea how some people are managers. Doesn't a manager have to actually manage? Some managers cannot be contacted and never actually show up. Lots of backstabbing and leaders who only care about themselves - it's really unfortunate to know that leadership doesn't have your back. Technology jobs being moved overseas more and more. FTE's and temps, working side-by-side on the same team, doing the same exact work. Complete and total reluctance to ever hire temps for years and years. You see, there is no room to add to headcount - oh, expect for these 10 new positions in India",American Express

I was told that the diversity at Amex was a facade when I first started. I ignored the warning and didn't believe that an industry leader such as Amex could partake in discriminatory and exclusionary practices. There's a reason that discrimination is mentioned in Glassdoor reviews. It's prevalent. Amex claims diversity and inclusion in their Glassdoor intro and beyond for marketing and recruitment efforts only. They're checking a box because it's trendy and upheld by law, but there's nothing done in practice. HR does nothing to stop discrimination when reported and will protect their racist managers even when showing proof of discrimination and harassment. The racial tension that's on display throughout the country right now is alive and well at Amex. You'll be shocked by the amount of stories that you'll hear about former employees leaving because of the discrimination they faced while working there. This is the reality. You've been warned.",American Express

Not just lip-service. - With recent transformations especially using the Technology-first approach, the company has molted from its state in the first decade of the millennium. - Like with any very large global corporation, cannot expect the agility of a startup but company places very high value on agility and speed of decision making. - You are treated as a person, not just a body with a brain and hands. - Senior management takes employee feedback seriously.","- Very large matrixed global multinational (couple more adjectives) corporation.

However, there are disadvantages to this - some people forget that they're in a professional environment and should act with respect and (real) courtesy. - The benefits are great. - The Corporate Social Responsibility team does a great job raising awareness, acting on its commitments, and pushing employees to give back to their communities through service or donations. However, I would like to see Amex go beyond sustainability initiatives.","- ""Alignment"" is a term that I never thought I would hate. Everything (even the most minuscule thing) has to be reviewed by each level before it can go out. This delays projects and is rather counterproductive, but yet Amex continues to do it. - This year, the company launched a campaign that focuses on the employee culture. It's supposed to include internal, but at the moment is focused on external applicants and sharing ""why is great to work at Amex"". I haven't seen much benefits so far. - There are too many tenured employees. While they do bring value, there's not enough out-of-the-box thinking or fresh perspective. Everyone speaks in Amex-speak, which can come off as cultish. - It is very hierarchical - I've never seen a company so fixated on hierarchy. I would never recommend, with experience, come in as an Analyst because the benefits suck - like they have less vacation days (WTH). Fortunately, they're now finally eligible for bonuses. - I get strategy change, but Amex takes re-orgs to another level. In my less than 2 years at Amex, there have been many re-orgs.

Leaders do not like it when you discover things sooner than them or know more than them. They get intimidated, which is human. Hours can be tough if you lose out on shift bids.

What they didn't tell me is that AmEx keeps moving the bar further away as you get closer to the finish line. The metrics are unfair and unrealistic to earn a regular bonus. Every customer gets an opportunity to submit a survey, however, the LAST AmEX employee to speak to the customer, during each call, is upon whom the survey falls. Therefore, if the customer speaks to collections first, and gets angry during the call, then collections transfers the call to you to discuss having misplaced their credit card, everything they say in the angry survey is credited to YOU. One survey with a ""poor"" rating will cause you to lose your entire bonus for a rolling 3 month period! Another unfair metric is counted when you assist a customer and they call again within 7 days. Even if the customer calls back for a totally different reason, the fact that they called at all within 7 days means you did not properly assist them. For example, if the customer calls you to pay their bill, then 3 days later calls again for a password reset, THAT is counted against YOU because the customer called back within 7 days. This, too, counts against your bonus. Further, there are no assigned workspaces. Seating is in a first-come-first-selected area. You are assigned a locker for your personal belongings, but change desks from shift-to-shift. The workspace is approximately 20x40 with only a small panel between each desk.

Leadership is good about being transparent when change occurs and they set clear expectations. They are also really good about setting time for 1:1 calls and making themselves available when needed. This is important because working remote can sometimes be a challenge when you need help or have a question. The final thing I’ll say is that the paid time off is very generous (and you can buy more) and the company doesn’t let your PTO roll over into the next calendar year.

Only 1 of my 4 bosses so far has focused on my career goals and development. * Given the cost of living in NYC, the salary is SIGNIFICANTLY below competition and I'm surprised we still attract employees. Sadly, even a promotion to a Director level job will give you an increase that only offsets inflation and the usual NYC cost of living increases (rent, subway fares, etc.). However, they make jumping to this level incredibly difficult that you wonder why you get such a paltry pay increase. * Job moves and promotions are inconsistent as leadership has their favorite employees or peers picked out. It was so bad at one point that in our annual employee feedback forum, favoritism towards certain employees was a significant driver of dissatisfaction among employees. The message that sends is demoralizing to employees that have the right experience for the job and good performance reviews but a leader behind-the-scenes already pushed to have their favorite employee get the job. * You have to interview for lateral moves even within your same organization (you don't get a pay increase for lateral moves) and it can be as difficult to get a job internally as if you were coming in as an external. It's a lot of process for the sake of process. The exception to the rule is if you're one of the favorites and then they quietly place you in that new role. * Re-orgs are so common they could put a recurring quarterly meeting on everyone's calendars at this point. * The ceiling is very low at Amex despite the fact that it's a huge company. The majority of Directors will never get to the next level and the company doesn't focus enough on developing Directors with the skills to get them there either.

People are expected to move roles every 18-24 months generally on the lower levels (analyst, manager) but its a political process at any large organization. The rating system is down on a bell curve and people are rated against their peers who all have absolutely different goals and metrics. I wish Amex was similar to Goldman Sachs and abolish rating their employees with numbers, it is outdated and archaic. Lack of diversity in business teams is really frustrating at times. Being a part of a monoculture doesn't allow different thinking. What I also am disappointed in seeing in all of these glassdoor reviews is the lack of transparency in the ""displacements"" that goes on at American Express. Amex goes though many reorgs, usually 18 months on a wider company scale, but still occur on a yearly basis for many business units where people are reshuffled around. With this reshuffling, people are told they don't have jobs any longer, ""displaced"" and they have to apply for other roles within the company. I thought I was joining an established Fortune 100 company that has been around since the 1850s, but Amex still lays people off under the guise of being ""displaced"" and that still doesn't sit well with me. So people applying to Amex should be cognizant of that.

Everything was reorged and the leaders that took their place made increasingly poor management decisions. They did not inspire or establish a vision or goal. Everyone saw through their forced optimism. * Worst silo'd teams I have ever seen in my career. Seriously, this was even worse than a case study I read in business school. Work was often doubled, tripled, and quadrupled in some cases. People sitting 10ft away would never speak about what they were doing design wise and other teams would flat out refuse to collaborate. * Common to have production outages due to the most abysmal IAM I have ever seen. * The most tedious and complicated CM system I have ever seen. Someone's job is literally to fill out CM. No, I am not joking. * This is a MASSIVE H1b shop. That's not a problem, many companies do it and do it well see: Apple, Facebook, or Google. However, this office is probably ~90% H1b's. Just keep in mind the cultural differences may make it difficult to build friendships or report. * Contractors are commonplace here. Management is unable to get FTEs (see below). * Compensation is quite below average for the area. If you are going to be in Palo Alto and not be a sexy startup, you need to pay high salary or bonuses. You are competing with FB, GOOG, NFLX, and AMZN. Talented engineers are turning down positions here due to compensation. This leaves management to hire the bottom performers.

For the past few decades all they have done is launch various fancy looking credit cards but failed to think of ways to revive/innovate the modes of payments. I mean, it took companies like Paypal, Apple, Samsung to come up with innovative ideas to make payments. The top leadership consists of people who graduated from various unrelated streams like English literature, psychology and were probably classmates with Bob Hope and obviously think the best way to cut down on expenses is to lay off people or move departments to India. The people who are laid off are usually the band 35’s and lower. The VPs who generally are band 45s and up remain unaffected. Not to forget, there are several layers of VPs. There are more VPs in a department (band levels ranging from 45 to 65) than the people who are actually hands on and working. Coming to the technologies at Amex, it does not matter if you spent a good part of your life getting education (a BS and an MS in CS), you would be reporting to directors who are not even from the engineering background (being a BS and an MS in Computer Science from an accredited University in USA, I reported to a director who had a Pharmacy background and had nothing to do with computer science/technology). Kudos to the legal team to even justify his H1-B managing engineers. If you want see the H1-B abuse, you should work at Amex. People with textile engineering background are on H1-B and working as Lead architects. You get promoted only if you are the favorite of your VP and you don’t question any of your leader’s authority. I have seen couples working as VPs (both husband and wife are VP) in the same technologies department, reporting to the same Senior VP, not sure how have they been able to fool the system. Don’t even get me started on the contractor culture. They hire contractors from companies you have never ever heard of. For some contractors there are layers of contract companies behind. Most of the contractors cant even speak English properly leave alone writing elegant piece of code. Most of your time on a daily basis is spent typing emails to other teams that you are collaborating with on a platform. No body/team really owns up if something breaks/needs fixes. You will end up spending most of your time trying to explain the flaw and ultimately things get done only if you CC your VP in the email. God forbids if you are trying to get access to a system. It took me over 5 weeks to upload images on an internal image hosting server since I didn’t have access to it. Your access requests need approvals from not only your manager but a couple of VPs. In the name of cultural events they celebrate Indian festivals, perhaps a no brainer since Indians are the majority here. Never could really comprehend, how doing a fashion show in funny looking Indian outfits was celebrating Asian culture. Come on now, there are so many other countries in Asia. Every VP conducts a quarterly town hall. You can imagine the amount of time you waste attending those, given each department has a dozen VPs. And did I mention the presentation is more or less the same. I have been to town halls where they play videos of some south Indian/bollywood actor, now being a non Indian/asian not really sure what am I suppose to do with that or what has that got to do with quarterly town halls? At the technologies they even host some award functions. Somehow for the 3 years I have been there, I see the same handful folks sweep all the awards. The funniest part is, the same guy can win a platinum reward, gold reward and silver as well. Can Hussain bolt win the gold, silver and bronze at once??",American Express

The only con about working here is I gained a lot of weight so I’m trying to work it off by walking the stairs, personal training, and yeah now passing up the free bagels, ice cream and donuts.

For the most part- everyone is really nice. Have to think if the pros outweigh the cons for your situation.,"The job is extremely stressful. In the first few weeks of on the job training several people cried and I heard from people who have been in the position for a while that it is very normal to see people crying because this position is so stressful- not really something I think should be a job ""norm"". There are several systems you use and while a few of them are user friendly the others are not. Not to mention your systems crash, act weird, and can be slow making your calls awkward- but you are never supposed to mention faulty systems to customers. Management pretends to listen to feedback but nothing really changes. Customers are terrible but we are supposed to bend over backwards for them: survey results are the biggest drive. You are graded on almost everything for you call. Although this is a decent paying job- way to much stress and pressure put on call center employees. My biggest letdown for this position with ""growth"". All over you would hear about how people would say that there is so much growth in the company and if you stay for a year you can move into different departments or get promoted. What management failed to realize is that a year is a very long time to do something you do not like. Secondly the ""promotions"" are positions that do not take you off the phones but instead have you dealing with even wealthier customers, or working on different travel needs. Sometimes people get promoted to become coaches or leaders. If you are a leader you are basically micro managing people or just walking around answering everyones questions.",American Express

Depending on your team your work and contribution will make sense and you will be actually able to see (and even use) what you created. Also, at least in the engineering dept, senior leaders try their best to showcase their vision to their teams so everybody is clear on what is the objective and what is expected to achieve. In terms of benefits, PTO is the best perk, you get plenty of it and basically are free to take it whenever you want. Also the tuition reimbursement and health insurance is ok, it is not very expensive, has good coverage but the deductible is high.

I would say the constitute maybe 20-30% of the workforce, hopefully in some years this isn’t a problem anymore as I know that amex is trying to hire talented and prepared individuals. Believe me when I tell you that dealing with people who are there just for a paycheck and nothing else is EXHAUSTIVE.

I have been in a situation that I had basically nothing to do on a day just waiting on an email to come back and proceed (thankfully for the company I always try to keep myself busy helping others) This makes this move slow, the amount of time wasted on formalities is unmeasurable, and some times you don’t even know what is the purpose of what you’re doing.

I never received an email over the weekend either and if I did, I wasn't required to respond to it until Monday at 9am. - Fabulous access to the food court located inside the mall. - Amazing views. - Despite being a huge building, the elevators were fast and efficient. - People on my team were super smart and friendly. - As long as you are not an admin, this place will probably have great opportunities.","- Extremely low end of the salary range compared to market rate. - High Deductibles for insurance. - 3 weeks of vacation days but it is actually really 2 because they tack on the bank holidays. A bit of a false advertising there. (This could vary depending on what band you are) - Band heavy. Everything is about what band (level, title, etc) you are in which could lead to egos and fear. They throw it around all the time. Band levels also dictate what salary range you will fall in when you first sign on. I had asked for more due to my experience but they told me that due to my band level, I was maxed out at $xx,xxx salary. Make sure you get clarification in writing. - Potential salary caps depending on your band. If you decide to sign on, make sure you understand your growth potential here. (This applies to administrative positions, as all others I feel like have more opportunities for growth) - Ask about what reviews, pay raises, etc. Again, make sure you know what you are getting into. - Very corporate environment, though no surprise there and was expected. - Because it is a huge company, expect hoards of people all the time. (This may not be a con to some of you...) - Admins are not very highly regarded. There's a lack of respect. Again, probably also depending on what department you are in. - If you are an admin, you can get more money elsewhere.",American Express

Decent cafeteria, some people are nice.","Imagine getting up in the morning and getting ready for work, like always. Now imagine not having any control over anything in your house. The only control you have is a form that you fill to get access into ur restroom, brush your teeth for example. Imagine a person opening the door and holding your brush and he is brushing ur teeth with it. You ask for another brush, maybe an electric brush, but they say that they don't have a template for this brush, they haven't heard of this brush and they don't have any training either. Either way, it's their hand and they will brush ur teeth the way they want to do it. Similarly, imagine the same process for everything else u do in the morning. Now imagine 1000 ppl living in your house . Ur house is big enough to accommodate all these people, but it's still their house as well. Their job is to make u get ready every morning and take over everything that u used to do alone. Not that u NEEDED any help, you sure as hell don't WANT any help, but the help is FORCED on you. Now imagine all these people are smug and cocksure of their job security. 99.99% of them are from the Indian outsourcing companies - unqualified and not interested in engineering. All of them are given the more challenging work while you are relegated to be a sitting duck, acutey aware of the frivolity and absurdity of your situation... A target for layoff. Imagine your boss, a robotic product of this environment, just doesn't give a damn abt your career. He just wants to impress his manager to get promoted. Agile is a word they use to get promoted and never practice. Imagine that you have nothing to do all day at work. You are depressed that you now have at least 50 people who do what you were in charge of in your previous job alone. You have to deal with a labrynth of political mazes, other people's emotions and, infuriatingly, other peoples languages to make any headway here. You ask for more work, but you are given documentation work. You ask for more technically challenging work, you are told no. The reason is obvious - thou shall not threaten managers position. Also, another bugaboo they like to throw around is security. They apparently have all these layers of unnecessary manpower ""for security reasons... Amex is finance company.. reputation at stake"" blah blah. This is an empty excuse. No correlation between restrictive engineering practice and security and privacy. The end result is total inefficiency. There is a reason why Indian bureacracy is one of the worst and most inefficient in the world. Well, it's taken over AmEx. ",American Express

I had to deal with abuse day in and out from customers who speak to you as if you are a dog. The supervisors you call for ""help"" are not very helpful at all.

I had to deal with other departments dumping (transferring calls without letting the customer know) calls on me when the customers were upset so that they wouldn't have to get a bad survey.

The bonus structure is very generous, but you will never see an ounce of your money you worked for if you get a bad survey.(bad surveys to amex means a survey that is not EXCELLENT, so even if the customer rated you VERY GOOD, its still bad to them). Bad surveys stay on your report for 30 days and commission is paid once a month so you do the math. The schedule is soooooooo strict.

If you don't handle your bathroom duties during that time, you can expect to have a meeting with your team leader about you not adhering to your schedule. The PTO structure is also generous (23 days per year) BUT, if you work in customer service and you want a federal holiday off you will have to use your PTO days. But you can even forget about having any holidays off your first year working there. Time off requests are based off seniority and availability.

They lie to new hires about how much their bonus will be when it's all based on surveys and very rare to get top payout. A low survey for something like long hold time goes against the agent who has no control over it. They get tenured agents to leave with shifts so they can outsource to $14/HR who have to be trained. Turn over is high because shifts r based on what u get on surveys and they make u bid once a year. Custmers have to hold because it is understaffed. All of this has led to a decrease in service.

The company has a terrific reputation. Most people I know have been in their sales roles for years and make a KILLING while loving their work. There may be high turnover in some of the call center roles and such, but everyone fortunate enough to be with AMEX in a sales role seems to understand that this is the absolute cream of the crop as far as sales jobs go.","The consultant role has a commission cap with a more modest base salary, but it's not meant to be a long term role. Most ""CBD's"" (as we're called) will move into Manager, Business Development roles within 6-24 months which is an uncapped commission role.

All levels have a lot of responsibility and room to showcase skills, and there is a corporate value of career development and promotion from within.","Whenever Amex reveals losses, there are infamous, giant re-organizations, which becomes a drawn out time of uncertainty (goals, priority, leadership, etc), and people start being treated as cattle.

Also, the 'new class' aka recent college grads, are extremely competitive with one another, gossip and salary comparison is commonplace, and makes it feel like a bad highschool experience.

1274,"""You WILL be laid off""",1.0,At least you don't have to buy government insurance since you'll get benefits from day one.,"These positive reviews crack me up. These are written largely by the blissfully unaware. Sure, if you're under 35 years old, you have a chance to be happy at Amex for a little while (until you realize that you're doing the work of three people, with nearly impossible-to-meet goals). There is ZERO job security because Amex is completely un-innovative and seeks to cut costs by sacrificing the employees that had nothing to do with losing major contracts like JetBlue and Costco (how long before the last big hold-out, Delta Airlines, realizes they're still partnered with an outdated soul-less dinosaur)? Until you do get laid off, be prepared to be reviewed annually (actually twice a year, because you have to write your own ""mid-year"" as well) based in huge part on customer surveys. That would be ok except for the fact that customers are asked questions about experiences over which you have no control or were even a part of. How blatantly unfair. Also, be prepared to work for a team leader who is dumb as a bag of hammers. If you work in Fort Lauderdale, you know who you are - you may have been fooling those above you all these years, but you've never fooled those of us who work under you! I had in excess of 15 different team leaders (management confuses shuffling people around with employee development) and MAYBE two or three of them had any knowledge (or ability for that matter) to do the job of the people they supervised. Some of the other review writers here seem to think that those of us who had direct customer interface were treated well. I don't know where that idea comes from because Amex treated all band 25 employees at our location like yesterday's garbage and the Fort Lauderdale location is very heavy on customer contact. (I spoke to 20+ Cardmembers daily). Also, if you like attending endless mindless meetings, you'll love working at Amex. I can't tell you the number of countless, tortuous hours spent listening to some dumb dumb or another drone on with their artificial ""I'm so happy I work here"" face on, designed solely to impress whatever dumb dumb they report to, none of whom dare rock the boat with any original thoughts; that would be too risky. You can read it on every one of their faces, ""God, just let me not be in the next round of layoffs...."" American Express first lost it's way back in the 70s from what I understand. They were too cocky with their ""we're all that"" attitude. They did manage to get back on track but they still coast on their artificial reputation. They no longer provide exceptional customer service, which was the thing that differentiated them all these years. It's now done mostly ""offshore"" by non-Americans who use the short time they intend to be with the company as a resume builder and couldn't care less about Amex or its customers and who, by the way, severely lack integrity and work ethic. So it's no surprise that the JD Powers award has gone to Discover the last few years, after having been given to Amex for the prior 8 or 10 years (I forget how many in a row, but a HUGE deal was made of winning it every year, all the big wigs patting one another on the back for a job well done, while pretending to give us low levels all the credit by handing out cupcakes on the big day. Golly! Thanks!). Suddenly, when Discover realized that one great way to win the hearts of their customers is to get the word out that when you call them, you'll get a US-based (translation: American) representative, along with the fact that there's not one good reason in the world to use a Card with an annual fee (a substantial part of Amex's customer portfolio), the JD Powers award is barely whispered about in the halls of the Amex building I worked in, other than by us lowly band 25s who frankly giggled our butts off about it since we knew we were on the chopping block anyway. Since Amex let me go, I'm having trouble paying my credit card bills. I've prioritized which will get paid and which won't. I find bitter justice in the fact that I'm going to pay off my Discover Card but not my Amex. There's a bit of karma for you American Express.",American Express

At the end of each year all members of the pay band above you meet to force rank employees as a class and determine merit increases and bonuses. E.g. All managers meet to rank their direct reports against those of other managers, all Directors meet to rank the managers on their team against the other managers in the company and apply ratings on a bell curve. The bell curve provides prescriptive guidance for merit increases and bonuses. In many cases, the merit increase and bonus (where applicable) for an employee is not determined by their individual contribution, or measured against a yard stick. Instead, the force ranking system leads to less than idea outcomes based on the ability and desire of a given leader to influence his/her peers during the rating session. As a leader, this can lead to strange conversations with your direct reports - In some cases a direct report will receive a middle of the road rating simply because of their position on the bell curve, while the leader can provide no specific guidance for improvement. In other cases, employees who would have been rated poorly by their managers were instead lifted into the median rate and provided with a raise and bonus while the leader has to deliver the message that they are not performing up to par, but will be compensated as if they are.",American Express

While it was barely legal, it was definitely highly unethical. I consistently worked 10-12 hour days due to the volume of work assigned to me; when I tried to raise concerns about my bandwidth, I was literally told that ""[you] can't say no to any [assignments]."" When I informed my manager that, after careful consideration, I had applied for a move to an internally-advertised role, I was released from my job three days later with no explanation as to why. No, literally: when I asked why I was let go, my leaders responded with saying they legally didn't have to tell me why due to some fine print. Analysts in marketing are overloaded with tedious, manual work with little to no formal training for their actual jobs within Amex. I found a dearth of clear direction on how the Analyst's actual work supports Company goals. As the Analyst is typically the most junior member of a given team, s/he is assigned responsibility for tasks no one else wants to do, such as tracking budgets and reconciling spend at end of each FY. Why assign the (arguably) least experienced member of a *marketing* team the responsibility of accounting for millions of dollars when they're usually not hired for / trained to do actual accounting? Overall, I heard from colleagues that I had a uniquely poor experience in my time at American Express. Many feel the company is a great place to work, and I was excited to join the company for the same reasons.

There is ZERO loyalty to long term staff here. If they can outsource your job to India or hire a contractor.....they will. Many of the long timers at Amex have been laid off multiple times. It's sad. Unless you're a phone sales person who constantly has high numbers, you're expendable. The layoffs are every single year and destroy morale. I've never been at an organization where there was so much fear every single day. Everything you do is based on covering your rear so when it comes to review time, your list of things you've done is longer than the others on your team. Working with your cheaper outsourced labor from India is not bad, but the incessant late night calls are. Do you like phone calls at midnight? If you don't I'd highly suggest not working here. They are also exceedingly difficult to understand over the phone. The pay at the executive levels are INSANE. While they lay people off, they give themselves multi-million dollar salaries and bonuses. I remember listening to a town hall where one of the executives was talking about her dog walker. Yes, while they lay off in mass, this lady is worried about her dog's twitter/instagram account and her private dog walker! This really is The Hunger Games! I wrote an earlier review stating I was trying to get out....and it didn't take me long to find a much better. I left a young high performing up-and-comer. In my short time at my new job, I have saved my organization literally millions of dollars using new financial models and knowledge application. It's amazing what you can do when you're not guided by fear.",American Express

Performance goals or RE's are often not accurate and not used during reviews (instead favoritism as usual prevails).

Lastly reviews are done on a curve, meaning if an entire department saves the day, breaks records the entire year, is the best department ever at American Express there still has to be a percentage on top reviews, very good reviews, good reviews, and bad reviews = idiotic. Lastly, discrimination is tolerated, one service delivery leader discriminated in TSC, was moved to Customer service, discriminated in that department, was moved again, and discriminated yet again.

When I was interviewed I was walked through the office to cubicles which are two person shared. I said ok. But when I actually started that was a whole different story. Noisy unprofessional environment. The collection floor looks like a long skinny bench with 70 people calling from a headset sitting barely a foot apart. Like an old television whacked out phone telethon on T.V from the 1980s. People yelling between tables raising green & red flags. Much disrespect in the training room by team coach. When doing role play in training the coach kept acting like a stupid customer calling in first in a Southern accent and then in a British accent. A big mess. VERY sad. Not all people with an accent are dumb. I don't think the American Express customers should be portrayed as stupid. SAD SAD SAD. Lets just say I got out of there quick. I am a professional collector who was laid off after 20 years of employment. I shed a few tears on this mess I got myself into. No wonder there is a big turnover I heard. My training class peers were dreading being called on to role play to understand the different accents. More diversity training needed there with team coach leads. Nobody makes it to high $ collector as there is too much seniority in high dollar. Even when sitting with high dollar collectors to observe they tell you that and say you just stay in low balance even though you are on the bench tables. Totally blindsided.

The reality is that leadership doesn't listen to customers or employees and is extremely slow to recognize, respond to, or fix known issues. It takes years, literally, to fix even the smallest glitches. The money invested in new technology must be minuscule as we use ancient PCs and our work takes twice as long as it should due to PC loading issues, slow internet, constant server disconnects, etc., smh. Amex supposedly 'encourages new ideas', and on-the-job learning, but has an unspoken policy that it be done off the clock (e.g. compulsory trainings must be done, but no time is allowed off the phones to do them, etc.). Breaks/lunches have to be cut short in order to meet abusive ATS goals. There is extreme micro-management and pressure from above at all times.

With the right leaders, you can have a good experience if you're OK with constant layoffs, downsizing, force ranking and attitudes this toxic environment creates.","With the loss of CostCo and the organization's failure to attract new clientele, American Express is going to what it knows best. Layoffs. You'd be absolutely amazed by the number of people this place has let go over the past 10 years. The pace has picked up considerably as of late with the announcement of a billion dollars in reductions. Every meeting we are reminded of the layoffs that will be taking place well into 2017. Thousands and thousands of employees will be out of work. Additionally, the organization is a HUGE believer in moving formerly American based positions to India. While our Indian counterparts are smart, it's difficult to understand them and the hours are almost completely opposite. So if you have a question or need something, it takes a full 24 hours to get a response slowing the process and adding unnecessary frustration. From what I have seen, the organization focuses on laying off their most tenured (expensive) employees, but what I don't understand is what message does that send your current up-and-comers? That you work hard for 10-15-20 years and you'll be replaced by the cheaper alternative? The organization also force ranks its employees meaning someone has to be the bottom. So if you have a team of 10 AMAZING employees, the organization still forces the managers into ranking someone at the bottom. The purpose of this is an ever-ready list of people to layoff at a moments notice. The result these company practices is nothing short of a toxic workplace. The high performers seem to be leaving in droves. The employees who don't know if they're being laid off are upset, anxious and apathetic. I always hear the phrase ""honestly I don't care"" when trying to get work done. The executives are just absolutely clueless on how to lead people. In a townhall recently someone asked ""are you worried about great people leaving?"" The exec's response was ""well those aren't the type of people I'd want here anyway."" So let me get this straight......you want people to be loyal to your organization, but your organization shows absolutely zero loyalty in return? Please..... I began looking for work as soon as they announced the layoffs as no one (especially me) wants an uncertain future where any month could be the month I can't pay my mortgage.

Amex is (or maybe was) a good brand that would look good on the resume. However, the career development here is a joke and not worth sticking around for unless you're not very ambitious and you just want a steady paycheck.. but if that's who you are, then you might as well just switch to Marketing or Finance where you can work less, get promoted every 2 years, and be the smartest one in the room (although the $$ is less). If you're an intern, stick around for the nice signing bonus and bail.

Contradictory at best. I feel very uncomfortable having to do this. Most of the leaders are great however 1/2 never sold cards, no help there. You cannot make it If you follow their training. Actively seeking to get out. Someone is being fired every month. There are no mistakes here you make a recorded mistake, the person listening will say you INTENTIONALLY tried to lie to the prospect. Very small ramp up incentive, you have to wait 5 months before you see your 1st commissions . Most of us are actively seeking psychiatric counseling for having to wait that long for commission.

1893,"""DIRECTOR""",3.0,"American Express is a terrific company given its well respected products and name in the marketplace. The company's reputation is built on the notion of excellence - from product design, to customer service, to employee know-how (thought leadership). The caliber of business minds are top notch (predominately) so you really get to sharpen your own business skills and acumen by being surrounded by great talent. In addition, expectations are high and the bar to outperform always increases each year, so you're never bored, but stimulated to do great things and to have a meaningful impact on the business. Likewise, roles at all levels can be robust, some coming with a high level of autonomy that you might not enjoy at other large corporate entities.","American Express is a company that operates on relationships and while this can be very positive from a team, cross-functional aspect, it can be nebulous when moving up in a promotional sense. It quickly becomes the who-you-know game, who has tagged you as a future leader or someone they know and want on their team now and/or in the future. Leaders often choose people they know to be on their teams and these individual often follow them throughout their career at Amex, getting promoted as their 'sponsor' gets promoted. What's challenging is that there is not always a correlation to that person being the best, most suited talent to get promoted and so you find some really smart people who despite having the chops, never reach the level in the organization that would truly mirror the value they bring. Naturally many of these people eventually leave the company out of this frustration, though primarily they enjoyed the work and the challenges that working at American Express can bring from an enrichment standpoint. The other major challenge is that while there are a bevy of really smart, talented individuals, the quality of leadership is lacking. Many leaders simply don't know how to inspire their teams, enhance their employees' strengths, and set the tone for a collaborative, positive working environment. Likewise, the culture can vary greatly by business unit. It can be shocking, the variability in culture, particularly since recruiting is done from the same suite of schools where there is typically some uniformity in culture-type, it's not like most of these individuals come in as bad apples. The problem lies in the top down leadership, poor leadership behavior that is 'bestowed' upon employees to adopt and emulate. This is in stark contrast to Amex's CEO, who has charisma leaping off of him and recognizes, celebrates, and inspires people at all levels. He's an individual that you immediately feel genuinely welcomed and respected by...but it doesn't trickle far past him (by and large) to senior leadership, which is quite a disappointment. People leave Amex either because of the challenges of moving up or a leader who makes what could be a cool gig if you will, miserable or a chore to come into every day. A change up in senior leadership, many who have been with the company for far far too long, could bring in some new blood that welcomes Amex's storied history in a forward looking, game-changing, and inspiring leadership way.",American Express
