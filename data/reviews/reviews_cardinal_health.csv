About a 15 minute process. You can work 65 hours that week, volunteer to and help cover other shifts that are not your responsibility, go far and beyond what is expected- and they will still be petty enough to not acknowledge anything positive and reprimand you for being 2 minutes behind the ""3 minute clock in window"". Yes it's important to be on time, but when they care more about you being late a few minutes, instead of you being harassed by other workers (there is always some kind of fight, drama, people walking out quitting every shift)- - or even acknowledging that you just worked a 13 hour shift on your feet the entire time when you could have left hours ago.. they rather scold you for minor details, ignore the chaos of the other workers, gossip within each other and with warehouse workers, and not appreciate the extra mile you put in just to make sure shipments get sent out timely and accurately.",Cardinal Health

Please note, that when I speak down on management, I am speaking about the upper management I.E. corporate, operations managers, etc. First off, favoritism, favoritism, favoritism. I think enough has been said on this in other posts. Basically, your raise and growing within depends on who likes you. Also, favorites can not show up to work countless times a year, making your day hell and they get away with it. The moment a good worker that is not a favorite is 5 minutes late, they are down your back. There is ABSOLUTELY NO WORK / LIFE BALANCE. If you are told you work 8 hour shifts, you are there for 10-11 when you are told you work 10 hour shifts, you can be there from 12-14. Here's where it really gets dirty, they force you to work overtime, but if you used PTO that week, you are being forced to work straight time! How that is legal is beyond me, but if you use PTO, get in a car accident, or get sick that week you get no overtime pay. You will be forced to work holidays while the favorites that work in the office enjoy them off with family. I worked in the MN location and the current operations manager there is a complete know it all who thinks he's better than anyone. He does not even take the input from your supervisor, he looks at your numbers and judges you 100% off of that. He just started last year and thinks he knows it all!

I asked how long it takes to get AU certified and was told 6 weeks. Do not believe this. The course takes 6 weeks but it takes several months before you can take the course + six weeks + several months to receive the certification. Then you won't actually get promoted when you get certified. They will make you wait until you are on the site license, which takes another several months to apply for and another several months to wait for approval from the state. Then your supervisor will tell you he will promote you, but will not actually do it. You will get strung along. You will wait for your promotion to get announced but it won't happen. When you question him about it, he will tell you that AU certification is only one factor in promotion and it is discretionary based on the manager's assessment of things like ""leadership ability"". But your manager only sees you for anywhere from 5 min to an hour per day because you are a third shift employee (10pm start - when you get AU certified you will work opening for some amount of time) and he is a first shift employee (7am start and he stays in his office outside the lab a majority of the time). You will open the site by yourself unsupervised for two hours, then act as a shift lead, generally with the newest employee for another 3 hours, you will perform production, perform sterility, do your paperwork, all without supervision - but when it comes to promotion, the goal posts repeatedly shift further back, and you don't meet the ""requirements"". In your performance review, your manager will blame you for ""not taking the initiative"" to become qualified in Amyvid processes, even though that is something that has to be scheduled because it is performed concurrently with your other tasks. This is a trend - your manager will shift blame as much as possible to the least common denominator, which is you. Then when you finally do get promoted between a year and a year and a half later (if you last that long without getting fed up), you will be making $19/hr as a Tech II. In the mean time you will put up with a work environment in which you essentially will be expected to be on-call, and your starting time can vary dramatically by 6 hours or more on only a few hours notice. This happened to me many times. Your manager will either not make a schedule or will make a schedule that is meaningless practically as soon as it is made on a regular basis. You may be expected to be in another state across the country on less than 24 hrs notice to cover for another site (if your site's staffing is adequate and depending on what you are qualified in). When you are sent somewhere, you will have to front the money for your hotel, for your rental car, and the rest of your expenses. Cardinal will reimburse you eventually, but for someone making $17/hr, it will be difficult to have that kind of money in your bank account to allocate to these expenses while you have other bills to pay.

Some folks have managed to get out of the supervisor assignment really early and into either a corporate position or move into a Black Belt position in their distribution center.

Annual salary merit increases are a joke. Management is convinced that they are the only ones that know anything. For that size of a company, the 401k offering is pretty pathetic. They suspended the Employee Stock Purchase Program and have not reinstated it. This should be reinstated if the company truly wants to attract - and retain - top-level talent. This is definitely Corporate America, so be prepared to work with people who are more focused on managing themselves into their next job rather than working with you, unless you can help them to advance their career. Be aware. The 'silo' concept is in full force at Cardinal, especially in IT. This can make issue resolution incredibly infuriating and frustrating. While encouraged, there will be times when work-life balance is not very balanced. You will be a valued employee, but make no mistake - when it comes to you or a buck, the buck wins. Always. The nature of this business can be volatile. When the announcement came out about the departure of a certain large customer, many people who directly served that customer knew the writing was on the wall. It was just a matter of time.

They continuously introduce formal strategies like Six Sigma, agile methodologies, Alan Cooper design methodologies etc hoping to gain control of the product pipeline, but, in my opinion, they understand neither the strategies they are trying to introduce nor the product pipeline enough to ever hope for success. The general feeling among employees is that senior management operates in an ivory tower, doesn't have any idea how things really work, and is just stabbing desperately in the dark. Although I said I like my work, unfortunately, I don't really get to see much of it go anywhere. It seems like most of my time is spent spinning wheels. I have often felt that my work output has fallen victim to politics. For example on more than one occasion I produced something because there was simply a need for it and it ended up being discarded because someone else discredited it and my qualifications to produce it. The final result is we ended up with nothing. This seems like a very unhealthy type of competitiveness that surely doesn't benefit anyone. I think if management were more engaged and had a better ""BS"" detector, this sort of thing would happen less frequently than it does. Sadly however, this happens quite a lot in the San Diego Tech Center.

Also I would like to add the incomes of corporate employees are outrageous, and the company has slid down hill ever since the day Kerry Clark set foot in here as CEO. He also single handedly killed employee moral by shutting anything extra for the employees completely off, not to mention no Christmas bonuses or incentive bonuses of any kind for non salaried employees.

There are so many different companies within Cardinal Health that the open jobs continue to appeal to even those employees who are happy with what they do. I think they truly care about people who work for them and definitely promote blance with family and job.,"With really large companies like Cardinal Health, people sometimes get the mentality that change is almost impossible. They tend to back away from change that requires a huge commitment or a lengthy process. We continuously look at the processes in place and discover problems but find it very difficult to get the problems resolved because we are so big. Big change must come from the top and requires commitment from each and every level of management. We have in the past had way too many levels of management but that seems to be going away. Getting the right people in the right positions is also very important but that's not always the case. We sometimes see people put into positions that have no working knowledge of what they are supposed to be doing, especially at the management level in corporate positions. I'm hoping that will change though based on the new spin off of another Cardinal Health company. A few years ago Cardinal wrapped all their companies together and in my opinion caused much red tape to be added to the processes and approval methods. With this new change I am encouraged!",Cardinal Health

The entire organization is just too big with 100's of Vice President's but nobody knows what they should be focuesd on thus little gets accomplished.

Change can be a good thing, but too much change too fast -- that is not a good thing. Cardinal's constant stop and starts and changes of direction are confusing to everyone -- especially its employees. Cardinal lost a huge number of employees -- and the knowledge that those employees owned -- when it transitioned positions from McGaw Park to Dublin during Wave 1. Everyone suffered as new employees struggled to learn their new jobs. Then came a round of layoffs -- and more confusion ensued. Then came announcement of a split and once again panic set in...and this in the middle of the Wave 2 transition. Add to that, a CEO who believes in a cube environment which is demoralizing, anti-productive, and completely interruptive to the ""normal"" work environment to which employeees were accustomed. Oh, and did I mention a 6 month postponement of yearly pay increases -- along with decreased bonuses due to company underperformance and a new pay-for-performance that further demotivates employees since reaching goals is no longer enough.... Weak management that lets certain employees do whatever they want while others are held to an entirely different set of accountabilities doesn't help. Unhappy employees moving from position to position or leaving the company all together add to the mix of confusion that is Cardinal - M.
