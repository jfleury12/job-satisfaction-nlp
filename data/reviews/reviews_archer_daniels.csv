The management has 0 accountability , their slogan for safety is zero is possible. but should be zero is probable as anything that may occur will be blamed on the effected employee 100% of the time regardless of any circumstance. This is also by design and the reason for their belief in zero is possible , zero liability as their goal.

I worked for ADM for 23 years as a maintenance A my job was to help maintain the electrical maintenance troubleshoot electrical problems and support of primarily electrical based problems in the plant.

These people should not under any circumstance have direct reports. Upper management values stability more than actually putting a great leader in place. Management is not rewarded for developing a great team so development is not a focus. “Perception is the only thing that matters.” Direct quote from a very senior person. It doesn’t matter if in reality you are destroying value or hurting the team if simply the perception is the opposite.

Good, productive engineers are left behind because they don't work the hours, while less than capable engineers get moved up because they are at work before their managers get to work and after their managers leave. The review system is unproductive because it is based on the amount of work done not the quality of work or the employee's ability to work with team members. There is no structured system for Engineers to move up in pay scale. There is no definition for Production Engineer, Engineer I, Engineer II, Engineer III, and Senior Engineer and these titles are arbitrarily distributed. You won't get the title unless you request it. They don't offer promotions. Really there is no inspiration to work for ADM and the longer you stay the less motivated you will be to advance.",Archer Daniels

321,"""CFO Group""",1.0,"Note: This review is only relevant for positions within the CFO Group (Finance, accounting, internal audit & IT). ADM is a stable company and one of the top ag companies in the world. In finance and accounting, the work/life balance is manageable, and most departments are laid back. There are summer hours, and a few employee appreciation events throughout the year. In addition, the company is very stable- while the industry doesn’t have much of an upside, it has even less of a downside; everyone needs food. The commercial group (not part of CFO group) is considered amongst the best in the world for grain merchandising.","The ag-industry is slow growing, has tiny margins, and doesn’t really change, hence ADM lacks a dynamic atmosphere, and more resembles an inefficient government bureaucracy. When you also consider that most CFO-group jobs are in Decatur, Il (a polluted, rundown industrial town), this leads to several negative factors: -Minimal career development. They don’t develop their own employees, so most senior-level employees are recruited from competitors who DO develop employees. -Low pay. Only top managers are eligible for any form of bonus. Salary is known to be far below industry standard. -Ancient IT systems, think 1980’s DOS system. Seriously. ADM isn’t Apple. -Brain-drain/less qualified employees. No qualified person really wants to live in Decatur. The 'leftovers' are more focused their multiple out of wedlock children and the Kardashians. -Nepotism. It’s amazing how many people have a relative that were ‘helped.’ Many many people have the same last names, and not by coincidence. Simply put, the CFO group is not for intelligent, hardworking and career-minded individuals. To further attest to ADM’s status, there have been several recent high profile departures, including the head of IT, while in the middle of a huge IT transformation project. The C-suite routinely brags about its high-margin acquisition strategy, but no tiny bolt-on purchase will really ad that much value when compared to ADM’s behemoth corn/oilseeds/grain divisions. The CFO group at ADM is a place to go for a job, for a paycheck. If you are ambitious, or want at least moderate career development, AVOID any finance/accounting job at ADM. If you are interested in a merchandising role, then ADM is definitely the right place.",Archer Daniels

The days off you do have are often determined to be on call and possible overtime shifts, but without compensation. So although you will technically have days off, you would not be able to leave town or make definitive plans in town. If you get called in and exceed 40 hours for the week, you would get overtime pay, but no pay for making yourself available even when not needed. This schedule makes it difficult to have relationships outside of work. It is a rough place to work, both environment and people. Officially harassment of any kind is not tolerated, but truly, you need to have very thick skin to be able to be there. Being the best you can be at your job isn't necessarily what the supervisors appreciate. Working hard, safely, maintaining a clean area, and being ahead of the rest of the pack when it comes to data reporting is not respected and some of (not all) the supervisors will trash talk good workers in front of other employees.

All of this is to ensure everyone goes home safely at the end of the day to their families and loved ones. They are also doing an amazing job with all the new construction over the years to make working conditions cleaner & safer for everyone whether an employee, visitor or a client. House Keeping is at the top of the list as well. Every job I have ever worked at since working at ADM I can say without hesitation I carried & carry all I have learned from ADM to all of them and all past employers and present are grateful to you. I would like to personally Thank Ron Wilson for making me do nothing but put parts away for my first 3 weeks, and telling me that in life the one thing No One can ever take from you is knowledge and knowledge becomes Wisdom only when you use it so remain teachable. Also that one learns even more when he is willing to teach others. Thanks ADM for all you taught me!!!!","Cons there are not to many except for your belief in Zero accidents. I believe 98 maybe 99% of all accidents can be prevented and that most are human error. Unfortunately things do break and what can happen will happen. I have seen people targeted after an incident that wasn't even a lost time accident and fired just afterwards for something not related supposedly. It has the reputation now so people are afraid to report anything because they know what will come next. I have never had to sign a paper anywhere that I have ever worked that stated I could not hold them liable if an accident occurred and if I did not sign it I would not be hired. Though I know the ADM is 100 % safer than when I first worked there that does not give me confidence that this is a safe place to work at. I think accountability by deniability shows a lack of integrity. Myself I personally think that anyone who deals with workmans comp is in for a world of hurt for they care nothing for the victim whether one seeks legal action or not. If one does seek legal action beware because it will follow that individual. If one is careful and follows your instructions to the T and are self-disciplined to consciously be aware of where they are, identifying thoroughly on safety sheets all existing hazards in that area & appropriate course of action to removing hazards or appropriate PPE while focused to job at hand, their odds of going home without incident is a strong 99%. Safety is a team effort so strive for perfection but be realistic that 1 to 2 % cannot be prevented. I am sorry but the smell isn't all that pleasant but I did get use to it.",Archer Daniels

In addition, it is troubling to see the company move its headquarters to Chicago from Decatur. I understand to an extent the business reasons for doing this, but I am concerned that this will severely damage an already fragile economy.

Management doesn't want to listen to you when you tell them that there's a problem, but when that problem gets out of hand and stops production it's the employee's fault. Safety only matters if it won't cost anything to do. If there's a problem with the tracks, and you tell your supervisor, he tells you he'll pass it up the line but keep using that track. When you keep using the track and cars derail, it's your fault because your supervisor never passed it up to management. Communication is non existent. When the superintendent comes out of his office, he doesn't know what anything is or where anything is. He will also yell at you for doing something wrong, when he doesn't know if it's wrong or right in the first place.
