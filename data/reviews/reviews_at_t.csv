It does NOT set you up for success going into the field. Sketchy tactics are encouraged by managers to get to your quota. You can grind our 60+ calls a day and not reap the benefits to hit your goal, while others can luck themselves into sales. That happens, but what is wrong, is that management gives you the ultimatum of firing you, or making you quit after 2 unsuccessful months. This is a TRAINING PROGRAM for a reason! This type of sales is 50% luck and 50% pumping out massive activity daily. In your third month of the program, they will introduce an inbound call system called DSA which will help some people hit quota and graduate, while others will be unlucky and get nothing. Also, please do not believe any recruiter that tells you your performance will play a part in getting you the location you want. Location options are strictly based on current company needs and 75% of graduates will either settle or be disappointed. Lastly, if you do make it out, they will pressure you to accept the new role and sign the agreement within 24 hours or threaten to revoke it. Terrible practice of ethics. They promise things will be different in the field but they aren't, they're actually more difficult. The retention rate of this program is awful for a reason, and majority of those who do graduate do so through inbound calls. Think long and hard before accepting this job, and ESPECIALLY before accepting a respective role if you graduate. If you leave within 18 months after graduating and accepting a role, you will owe back $13,000, which is why most people withstand their misery after graduating.

Once the investors speak, employees lose their jobs. There is also a disconnection between the employees in the files and the people who sit in an office and creat ETC’s for job completion. I don’t really think whoever creates an ETC has ever actually been out in the field. They do not realize the time needed to one, discuss the situation with the customer to actually figure out what is going on and what needs to be done. Two, the actual time that the job takes to complete. Plus, since the customer service department is outsourced as a technician you spend at least half your time apologizing for the mistakes customer service made in creating incorrect work orders. Customer service is only out to make money for the company by any means. Management is beyond poor.

If you work at an under-performing store, be prepared to be micromanaged until you either quit or are fired. If you're in a ""good"" store (heavily populated area), you will probably be fine. Some stores are out of footprint for selling certain services like broadband internet and yet upper management will put a goal in place knowing it's unattainable. For example, if your area is dominated by one internet provider that offers speeds that are ATLEAST 10x faster than what you offer, it makes it extremely hard to sell. On top of that, the broadband has less availability and you may only have 6-10 opportunities a month to sell a inferior service to reach your goal of 2-3 a month. Of course offering better deals online that aren't offered in store ($300 gift card deal) can be difficult and does result in lost sales because you're competing against your own company. The coaching system is broken in certain ways. You can be as objective as possible and mark off everything on a check list as you go with each customer, but management takes a subjective approach with the grading and that goes as well as mixing water with oil. The biggest metric you're weighed on is DirecTV and selling it is an uphill battle every day. It's not that it's a bad service (it does have some nice features to it), it's just the natural change of the market. More and more people are switching to streaming services that don't require contracts and are fairly cheap. AT&amp;T has been slow to respond to this change and still doesn't understand that the days of cable/satellite TV are numbered.

728,AT&T,"There are A LOT of downsides. It is a call center. There's a reason why call centers have extremely high turnover rates. They are soul-sucking places, and this one is no different. You are actually in the lower floor of the building, concrete walls, no windows. The call volume is INSANE. You can spend an entire 8 hour shift with back-to-back calls, and always more calls waiting in queue. This happens EXTREMELY OFTEN. The psychological effect of hearing your phone beep, call after call, for 8 hours is enough to drive someone crazy. We all hated it, naturally, because we are not robots.Headaches and eyestrain are common, as well as snapping and walking out. Customers are calling from any att wifi location globally, and you are there to assist them getting connected to the internet. Most of the calls are driven because of the captive portal page that people don't know how to get to. Everything here is metric based, your call time is supposed to be extremely low, but let's face it, that's not really something you have much control over if you are telling the customer everything correct and they are having difficulty. If you don't meet your metrics, you are counseled, put on a plan, and ineligible for promotion, as well as getting bottom of the barrel shift selection. Quality control listens to your calls and will very easily give you a low score, they like to nit-pick. They want you off the phone as quickly as possible (around 6 minute call time) to get onto the next call in queue and in order to do that you'd have to sacrifice customer service, basically cut people off and say ok, thanks for calling, bye, at the first opportunity. Management is pretty terrible. It's blatant favoritism and promotion of those willing to roll over and play good dog. You switch supervisor teams and shifts every 3 months. Shift selection is determined by metric rankings, seniority, and also of course, favoritism. Good luck with that.","You start off at a ""manager"" level, which equates better starting pay.

Actually a brilliant concept with great potential for success. BUT... at least in the North Texas area (Dallas/Fort Worth) RUN RUN RUN. The turnover is insane. Management, not all of course, but too many seem to be completely incompetent and do not even know the systems, products, services, or reality of the sales process and procedures. My manager literally knew nothing and not even once could answer simple job related questions. She had to send you to a peer or tell you to go look up the answer yourself. Why was she there? To be a bully I guess? Since they lack the needed knowledge they have no alternative but to manage as bullies. Every day is filled with intimidation and threats. In all my career I have never witnessed so called sales managers who literally had no clue on how to manage a sales team. Every single person I know is currently searching desperately for a new job. It appears top performers all too often are allowed to function in the gray areas, then are used as a whip to intimidate your performance. If you are on the managers bad list, then the dispatchers are instructed to only send you to low scored sales calls. Thus making it a huge hurdle to reach targets. Morale is terrible. The con... in North Texas... is MANAGEMENT... if you actually want to call it that. Of the original 14 on my team when I started, only 5 were left when I went back to my former job. Only 1 person on my team had been there a full year. He has since left and gone to a competitor. I got out as soon as I could too. Until leadership changes RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN!

To become a leader there you just have sit on the bench longer than others with no true continuous learning or hard work. These people decide the fate of your career - because leaders are uneducated and because HR Payroll wants to save money people often get arbitrary titles that don't match their role and are lower than their actual responsibilities. Even now that leaders are starting to learn agile they throw out random titles they think sound cool. In fact some leaders handed out titles before they knew agile. - people are pushed around as labor resources without consideration to what role they applied for or want to be. No matter your performance reviews everyone is seen as an equal random labor resource. - health insurance isn't actually that good given the company size. - to save money they frequently take away benefits without increasing salary or other benefits. For example telecommuting. - they always say they want the company to be more innovative but what they mean is come up with ideas in your free time, execute them on your own time as well on no budget, and then save money for the company while your supervisor and his or her leadership tower gets the credit. - corporate propaganda: you frequently get emails to vote for bills that are against net neutrality or fair market practices.
