Toxic, no trust environment. CYA at all times!! After hiring, the goal is on financial reporting to management, there is little or no engineering integrity. The company does not produce, it assembles. All vehicle components, hardware, software, etc are sourced out to suppliers based on requirements. Lowest bidder wins. Engineering at this company simply means writing requirements for supplier bids and verifying that the requirements have been met.

So they will refuse to help any newer co-worker or put in any extra effort that involves work outside of their assigned project or causes them to put a few minutes outside of 8 hrs a day. Else they demand that their assigned project deadline be delayed or they get paid overtime, even if they are salaried. So they will basically ask you to re-invent the wheel unless they are compensated. 4) Ford employees who have been around for a while are very good at making look like they do work, when in reality they are just good at coming up with a million obstacles about why something cant be done.

Although there is a conscious effort to change this mentality and to become more agile, there is still a 'Day 2' mentality among many of the veterans as very few of them are thinking outside of the box, This is probably because very few employees have been exposed to many (or any) other work environments. Good thing? Bad thing? It's a double-edged sword - people don't leave because Ford is a great place to be, but it also creates a closed system where ideas can't freely circulate. Lastly, I firmly believe that Ford can become more effective if there was not a fear of business tools. Yes, information is highly sensitive and we don't want information leaks, but Ford seems to hide from new and innovative approaches to managing data and encouraging efficiency. Leadership should push new initiatives for improving business efficiency.","It is a great feeling to see your ideas and work come alive on the pavement.

681,Ford,"Terrible work environment; dark windowless corner of the building. Management continually likes to change expectations for deliverables or add deliverables that cannot be reached by designated milestones. Very very difficult to deliver a program given the massive number of processes and rules that must be followed. Expectation is you are available 24/7 (cell phone has to always be on). They might say ""family first"" but the family they mean is the Ford family. Almost impossible to get out of the seating dept once you are in; they will not let people transfer to other depts within the company without a fight and a lot of made up unwritten rules that have to be followed first (ie you have to have a manager's permission to apply for inter-company roles). Career growth is stagnant, typically supervisors are hired in from outside the company instead of from within. Salaried engineer bonuses are always less than what UAW members get and continually less than what other comparable OEMs (FCA, GM) get. OT is available but trying to get paid for your extra time is difficult and must be pre-approved, rules for OT are heavily biased in favor of the company (ie you must work 11 hours before you can book 1 hour of OT). If you decide to work at Ford in seats, insist on a min salary of $100k, you will need at least that much to offset the tons of unpaid OT you will have to work.","Nothing worth writing about, anything you can get from Ford you can get from other OEMS like GM and Chrysler.",1.0,"""Ford Seating Dept"""
