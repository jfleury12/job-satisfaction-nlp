There is an October “ghost” every year where reorganizations can be expected by the end of the calendar year.",John Deere
44,"""Thumbs Down!""",1.0,"Fair salary for the areas in which the company does business Good 401K Work Life Balance, depending on your location","CYCLICAL BUSINESS: The business performance is subject to a number uncertainties such as tariffs, new legislation, weather etc. UNFAIR GPMs RATING &amp; BIASED PROMOTION PRACTICES: There was a manager from Waterloo, IA that once commented here on Glassdoor in 2017 that the GPMs ratings are false. He wrote that he had used the GPMs more to punish than to help an employee. Yes, he was right. That is how it works! You work very hard, delivering 95-98% of the goals but the 2-5% that you failed to deliver will be your undoing during the end of the year rating. Promotions are based on who you know. It doesn’t matter how hard you work, if the opening is greater than LG7, you won’t get it unless you are the favored employee. RACISM &amp; ANTI-MINORITY: If Deere could keep Ivy League educated racial minorities in one position for 7,8+ years without a promotion, then you know there is a problem. I knew of minorities with Ivy League degrees who left the company as mid-level managers to become executives (Directors, VP..) at other global manufacturing companies. If you are a racial minority, Deere is only good until you are vested. After that, you may not get any meaningful career opportunity again till you are close to your retirement. Don’t let any of their publicity that shows some pictures of minorities hoodwink you into believing that Deere is a place for you as a minority, especially if you are a person of color. If you are a racial minority, your projects get extra scrutiny. You will be overly probed and thoroughly checked out. You will lack full support on many of your projects. Many vital information that you need to complete your project successfully will be withheld from you by your teammates. When they smile at you and praise you in your presence, they are secretly plotting your downfall underneath. You are the fun subject of discussion when they go to bars to drink beers or go golfing. If you are a racial minority, I will advise you to AVOID Augusta, GA, Dubuque, IA &amp; Waterloo, IA by all means. Dubuque, Iowa in particular is a very racist city and the residents show their disdain for outsiders. It was reported on the NPR in 2016 that the FBI was in Dubuque following a cross-burning event to sensitize the residents about implications of hate crime. Most Deere employees in Dubuque, IA are from the area and they hire and promote each other. As a matter of fact, you need to be a devout Catholic, Irish or German descent before you can make any meaningful ingress into Dubuque as a city. This same pattern is also evident in the way majority of “Dubuquers” who are Deere employees act towards outsiders. They are anti-minority; even ANTI-WHITES who aren’t from the area. Many racial minorities have come and gone while progressive-minded whites are also leaving Dubuque C&amp;F in droves for the Quad Cities. I have seen a racial minority (contract employee) from a top college being let go without notice only for the manager to post an open position in his group externally to hire a “non-person of color”. Meanwhile, there was another contract “non-person of color” employee from that same team who was helped to become a full-time Deere employee even though he never had any college degree. FAMILY TIES &amp; NEPOTISM: Nepotism is widespread within the company. People who are well-connected or related by marriage usually hire and promote one another. Sometimes you will see a husband who is a Labor Grade 12 or above with a wife who is a director, business unit manager or another Labor Grade10 at a near sister factory. I have seen a manager that once had his daughter-in-law as a cubicle neighbor. Some couples sit in the same office building at a distance of about 15 feet from each other. BOGUS GLASSDOOR RATINGS: About 26 ratings were entered between September 30, 2018 and October 01, 2018. All these ratings were highly favorable to the company. As an individual who has spent A LOT of time reading and analyzing Deere Glassdoor comments over the past 5 years, I can tell that the chance of a group of employees entering mass comments such as the one that occurred on 09-30-2019 is non-existent. I found that very strange! Then, roughly 12% of the highly satisfactory ratings came from interns and part-time students. These group of employees have temporary experiences and therefore are uninformed of the partisan nature of the company. Thus, I will advise future interns not to really consider their temporary experiences, which are largely positive as a signal of a great career outlook",John Deere

Mostly a good culture,"I've been a part of 3 major salaried employee buyouts in 10 years. Every minor downturn, a re-org comes out which displaces many people. Hires too many people when things are good and then overcompensates and gets rid of too many people when things get bad. If you are employed here, you might as well buy stock in the company because satisfying shareholders is the only thing that matters. Employees are not valued, regardless of your performance and tenure.",John Deere
57,"""Help me John deere - PLEASE""",2.0,You learn allot of software to do the jobs.,"Typical big company takes a year to do little or nothing. One group doesn’t know what the other is doing. Drawing checkers with 20 yrs. don't understand CAD. A drawing has to have a suppressed ( flat pattern) feature for sheet metal or it will not show as a bent part. Designers are taking thing off drawing blocks while checkers put them on. IT can take 2 wks to setup a simple meeting once you find all the required people. List with the product managers are constantly changing. To get this done fast you spend allot of time commutating between groups, setting up Power Point slides, filling out 4 sheet workbooks. Contractors are restricted from information that is needed to do the work as well as training material. They have been up and down in production, twice in the last four years. Contractors will probably never get hired so they don't pay benefits. Anger management is needed throughout the company, I watched a dozen people blowup at someone else.",John Deere

The company is very family-oriented so that leads to flexible working hours and opportunities to volunteer and engage outside of work. The EDP program is great because you start working with a cohort of new graduates so even though it was scary moving to a new town in the Midwest, I made friends and a support network very quickly and there were social and development committees in the program that ensured that all EDPs had a quality experience. This is by far one of the best rotational programs for new engineers and they give you a variety of options for your rotations where you are challenged, respected, and prepared to become a full-time engineer. I feel like I am a part of a community at John Deere and I'm so glad I'm not in a toxic, cutthroat environment that I saw at other companies. People come here to work and stay because the company values its people above everything else.",The locations are pretty remote and limited.

210,"""ASSEMBLY WAGE WORKER""",3.0,Clean environment to work in,John Deere only cares about its salaried employees and not about the people actually making the tractors. I'm sorry but how can anyone support a family on 20 dollars an hour when you have to pay 10 percent of your income towards your retirement and 10 percent of it to save for post retirement health care. All of these assembly jobs are getting harder and harder barely have time to go to the bathroom and barely make any incentive. Really makes people want to work harder when there is no incentive. Also more and more injuries are happening because people are complacent and tired from being worked so hard. I said my peace and nothing will ever get done,John Deere
211,"""Can be a great place to work except...""",3.0,Integrity is more than just a word at John Deere. It cements all of its decisions driven by ethical standards and it will never ask anyone to do anything unethical for any business purpose. One sure way to get fired is to do something unethical. It is clear and there is no gray area. I thoroughly enjoy this about working at John Deere because I never question my decisions when I know it is ethically correct.,"The biggest con is that it is a Midwestern company doing business globally, not a global business based in the Midwest. It has all of the tools to attract and retain the highest caliber employee using Video Conferencing, Skype, etc. except that mid-level managers will only allow employees participate in virtual employment when a spouse moves or it runs out of office space. This makes it very hard to advance a career unless you are physically willing to move to the Midwest at some point. The majority of employees went to the same colleges and live in the Midwest, this does not offer a lot of diverse perspectives from other parts of the country or other nations, especially at leadership levels.",John Deere

Deere promotes their pay as top of the line, but it isn't the highest paying in my opinion Employee recognition has went downhill in the last few years Top managers are often shuffled through every 2-4 years and are groomed for higher positions leaving low level employees to fill in the gaps If you are a contingent it can be difficult to get hired on Deere has never laid off a Salary employee, although contracts and contingent workers have been laid off, so this isnt a completely truthful statement The locations are mostly in Iowa/Illinois. if you want to work elsewhere good luck They treat the Engineers like Clerks who have an increasing amount of paperwork and BS, including filling in as Supervisor",John Deere

There is a strong emphasis on ""the How"" of how the company works towards their objectives. Colleagues are very helpful to each other and there is a genuine passion for the product. The company is slow to make decisions and changes, but this leads to a very stable (albeit conservative) employer. Company has been in business for over 180 years. Pay is decent and bonus makes it exceptional.",It is difficult to move up in the company without relocating around the United States (if a US based employee) and even internationally for those on higher career paths.

If you try to tell them that things are not right they will turn against you. I have seen people leaving jobs and they don't care about it. 2) Everyone is a relative to someone, all jobs are taken by the families and to be successful you should have father or mother retired. They take pride in generations working for them. 3) Management has been the weakest part, the managers try to do good but because of incompetency of their previous manager (relative), they're more occupied fixing their problems , who in my opinion must have moved up the ladder to another better position. 4) They talk about diversity, integrity, innovation and improvement as part of their vision but the ratio in the management of diversity was zero, out of 400 salaried employees only few were from minority groups, so there is no integrity following with no improvement or innovation. 5) Gossips, makeup and talking about others is important to be successful here, or talking about travelling or making friends. The networking becomes important because of having less training, knowledge and relying on each other to get the job done. It is like everyone is asking help from others. 6) The management is always in meetings, no time to actually solve a problem because there is another meeting waiting for you in 15 minutes. And, it is more talking and laughing than actually solving the issue because they put blame on someone who has already left or moved, it is so easy for them.. it is terrible. 7) There is lot of ego out there, they actually did nothing but born in a family that has someone in Deere. And, they have attitudes because they never worked hard to get a degree or struggled in life. Some who worked hard are really down to earth and nice but mostly are unprofessional.",John Deere

However if you are on the inside beware. In my opinion they treat their employees like a number just like any other company. The CEO a;ways quotes how ethical Deere is. Well he need to get down to level of the employees and see how this is. Most people are afraid to speak out. My wife has stage 4 cancer. She was sexually harassed and badgered every day by her boss. She worked thru her chemo. She brought this harassment to managements attention and they sidestep it. They put her out in the shop so she could breathe the welding fumes and forklift fumes. She has had over 20 surgeries. Now do not get me wrong we have been blessed by what we have but every year they take something away from us. My wife would come home crying due to this treatment. I told her to get the 30 years and get out. As far as me I put in 42 years there as a Sr, designer. I had issues of PTSD and depression. They do not get. I lost my first wife , 6 month old baby boy and my 2 year old to a trailer fire. I was told that at the time I could only take a week off. Now pension and social security disability. When my wife retired she was under extreme stress and their is no consultation when you retire fill out the forms and walk out the door. Same for myself. We did not know that social security disability was the same as social security. Our fault I guess but I have talked to many others and they had no clue either. So since my wife has lived longer than was expected and the doctor stated that she is a miracle and God has other plans for her we now owe Deere a 6 figure number of dollars due to this over site. They stated that they would except X amount of dollars to pay this back. My wife will die before this happens and our lawyer even stated this as this is a life and death situation. The papers that they sent to us mentioned that we could pay this in one lump sum, yeah right. Now both of us retired , by the way when I had my breakdown I was called into the office for missing deadlines and what ever. This was not true as I could not due this if I did not have the parts from our vendors. Mental issues they do not understand and nor do they care but they will parade the wounded soldiers on a tour thru the shops to make them selves look good as they do. As I said we have been very blessed to work for this company. However it could be so much better if they practiced what they preach. I put in so much free time to make sure the products got down the I cannot even count. I was proud to do that but I learned quick it did not matter. It almost took a year to get my retirement plaque and my shirt and picture. My plaque said 30 years not 42. We got this stuff on the same day we got the letter stating that we owed these monies. My wife could die next week or a year from now they do not care thru the pension department. Anybody in their right mind would not do something like this and owe 6 figures back to the company. I guess if my wife would of died a month or two after having all the treatments they would be happier that this money was not owed to them.

There is relatively little innovation. Given the age of a lot of the employees, the culture, while relaxed, can be rather stiff and boring.

Leadership and Company Culture- Its the Deere way or the highway, not open to challenging the status quo or new ideas, change agents not welcome, ineffective in dealing with poor performers, plenty of them, cloning and selecting future leaders that mirror a 175 year traditional culture that is severely outdated.

As I became familiar with the various functional departments in each location, it quickly became apparent that each location, although performing the same tasks/producing the same products, had their own unique culture, different policies & procedures, and our ""sister"" location was 12 hours behind us. Also, their functional departments were very silo'd, even when comparing the same functional areas in different geographic locations. All of these differences made it very difficult to implement a single system to be shared across the entire company because that required all locations and functional departments to start becoming unified, sharing universal policies, procedures, and even organizational culture. The 12 hours time difference with our ""sister"" location was also a big challenge. Being our ""sister"" location, we were required to collaborate and work closely with many of their employees. In order to do this effectively, I had to delegate my project leadership for that location to a local project leader in that company as I could not effectively lead the project without being available during their work hours on a daily basis. Delegating project leadership to two leaders is always a challenge especially in this case because we had the 12 hours time difference as well as a language barrier which greatly impacted project communication between the two of us. Ultimately, to overcome the communication issues, I often sat in on web conference meetings at 2, 3, or 4 AM and still arrived to work by 8 AM to work a 10 - 12 hour day.

There was room to grow into new areas, inside and outside of engineering. For most position, work-life- balance is exceptional compared to many other companies. The company has been stable for many years, and aims to keep a certain percentage of contingent/contract workers in their workforce so that they don't have to lay off full time workers. The pay is about average, but the bonus program is outstanding. The 401k match percentage is dependent on business results, but is currently and has been maxed out for several years. It is equivalent to 10% of salary. Deere also has a company funded pension plan in addition to the 401k. People don't think of Deere as a technology company, but really it is just as much a technology company as it is an equipment company. Deere isn't afraid to invest in new technologies","The IT group is out of touch with engineering's needs. The health insurance plan is a high deductible plan, which I personally like, but many people don't.

The John Deere support system, from online classes to helpful coworkers across the country, is extremely beneficial and leads to a positive working environment. Benefits are extremely good, pay was much better than other internship offers. Overall, the greatest pro is that all employees (from wage to salary) are satisfied and willing to work cooperatively.","Employees spend money very freely, as in most large corporations.

If you like living in the midwest (I do) this is one of the better compensated places you can go. There is also the chance to move around within the company with a good relo package to offset some of the costs associated with moving for work. At the supervisor level, they will even buy out you house to get you down the road faster.","Politically, a complete nightmare. I have never worked someplace where there were so many landmines to avoid. Also, expect complete shock if you ever express a desire to do something different or work at another company. Most Deere folks are so brainwashed they think that Deere is the ONLY place anyone should ever want to work. Its certainly a good job, but it is not the same, great, employee-focused place it was in the past. Current management practice is to pay lip-service to the importance of employees to the organization, while constantly ""refining"" the formula used to calculate bonuses and raises so that you make the same or less each year regardless your performance. Benefits have really taken a hit in the last several years as well, first with a significant change to the health insurance (that resulted in a lawsuit from a group of retirees) and then with a significant cut to the 401K matching plan. The ONLY way to really see a noticeable change in your compensation from year to year is to continue to get promoted. That means you see an organization where every other year people are jumping to new jobs. Continuity within functional areas is horrible. The person you are working with on a project today won't be there tomorrow, and you had better plan to find your next role the day after that if you don't want to be labelled as someone who isn't capable of moving up.",John Deere

Little fiefdoms are popping up everywhere. - As a result of the point above, functional areas don't play nice. You will spend half of your day (at least in Waterloo) defending yourself from others in the organization. Once something goes wrong, there isn't a scramble to make it right, there is a scramble to hurry up and generate a ""metric"" that shows it is someone else's fault. - Emphasis on SVA (shareholder value added) drives some really bad behavior. Shoving tractors out the door at all costs is the norm. There isn't a single process or standard that can't be subverted, at least temporarily, to make green tractors roll out the door. - John Deere is a political nightmare. We have created a giant bureaucracy of an organization, and then celebrated and promoted people who prove capable of little else than navigating through the red tape. When the only skills that are valued are political in nature, promotions go to the people least likely to change the climate, and people who do amazing things are left at the lower levels of the org chart to keep making miracles happen.
