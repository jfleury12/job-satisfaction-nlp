Of course, you have to meet a monthly quota to get it...so you could literally go months with expenses and no earnings. Your first ""clients"" will likely be your friends, family, and former colleagues. You'll start by listing out 200 names of people you can potentially talk to about your new career. Note: Be careful about entering your folks' information into Salesforce because once you leave, they own the data and will contact them long after you've left the company. I had to pay for EVERYTHING including software, office supplies and staff that I didn't use. The chargebacks are onerous as well.

There is a production based bonus of up to 80% of commission plus addition to other production bonuses for the first 36 months with the company to supplement new agents while they build a book of business. That said, if you expect to get paid for showing up then perhaps this isn't the career for you. Building your financial services practice is no different than starting a business from the ground up! You need to be completely self motivated and have an alternate income (such as spouse income, investments, or pension from previous career) or 6 - 12 months of savings while you are building your practice. If you come into this expecting to be profitable from day one then you probably need to find a different career. 2. You must have a thick skin! If you can't deal with hearing the word ""no"" then this is probably not the career for you. You are going to hear it all the time. This is a sales position and ""no"" is simply part of the customer/client psychology. 3. You can't be a know it all. I've seen too many people fail in this career because they walked in thinking they had a better way and didn't follow through on what they were trained to do. You can't do that. I hate to say it but if you're going to be successful in a career with New York Life, you have to drink the Kool-aid.

146,"""Not worth the drama and fake lifestyle""",1.0,"You can basically manage your own schedule and you know that on occasion going to get what you are paid for your hours of effort put into a sale. Supposedly best training in business for newcomers in the industry. Making council agent status is the key to opening doors for growth, and NYL has great council agent fully paid parties and conferences. In the years I have been there I saw folks move into several different positions from an agent position. So really opportunities are there but only if you reach Council Agent status. Which is REALLY hard!","The hours of effort put into a sale are not typically going to be enough to make up for the hours of effort put into all the sales that didnt happen. It is 100%commission, and they TAKE THE COMMISSION BACK if the client changes thier mind or misses a payment. That leads to unstable income and again, the hours of effort in sales and then the effort to make up,for a sale doesnt always equate to income you deserve. Most people fail because of this back and forth of income. PLUS, they have all these charges they take off your ledger like rent, copies, etc. And you never seem to really get the income they say you will. The Partners do thier best but it is a numbers game and at the end if the day it feels like a MLM or network marketing business and not at all genuine. If you arent doing well or the ""top performer"" in the office you are basically exhiled, and ridiculed for not being able to make huge ticket sales or double digit sales per month. When you are in interview stages and considering this as a career, you are courted and told how simple it is and they paint a picture that people want and need what we are selling and will be tripping over themselves to give us referrals and sign up for more insurance or move investment dollars to our #1rated company. But that isnt the case otherwise the retention goals would be MUCH higher and NYL would be able to offer real base salaries. It is quite the good scam for them; we basically work for free singing how great NYL is and trying to recruiting people (because you earn off their commission too as recruiter) but at the end of the day NYL gets a hell of a good labor force without having to pay for advertising or recruiting efforts. I worked for NYL for over 3 years before I woke up and realized it would always be a scam for the employees.They flaunt ""high income earners and residual earners"" as speakers to motivate us. But eventually they all devolge that they had to puchase so many policies on themselves at peak times to make some of the goals and recognition points, and after so many years it is like they basically have to earn $xx, in commission to pay for thier own policies...(well that is just money recycled Back into NYL's pocket.) So again, good job NYL, you are clever in your business model. All this does make it so they are rated #1in the industry and able to make claims and do right by the client though... So thats good. I notice that the partners are pivotal too, not for really helping the agents but for helping themselves, they will find clients and basically run the meeting themselves and then just assign the commission to an agent on thier team. So they manipulate to keep thier # and retention good to promote themselves in the view of other partners and move up to run thier own office. While I was there I saw people get promoted to that had no right recruiting others into this business and being a mentor because without thier contacts list, past connection or timely family member's retirement or passing they NEVER would have been able to close a deal. They were basically shells for other partners to manipulate for own gain. The Back office staff does the best they can, but with such a turn key business and they have to do so much hand holding for the newbies it seems they are underpaid and understaffed.

The office environment is very professional and people are generally friendly. If you are a team player and have a great attitude than you will have plenty of growth opportunities. Work life balance is great. The company will start you with 2 weeks vacation, and an additional week of summer days (not guaranteed but was approved every year), 7 sick days, 3 personal days. After 5 years you get an extra week vacation. Management is flexible on doctor's appts and other life events as long as communicated properly. I left New York Life because I was looking for a job closer to home with less hours and more flexibility, but other than that I would most likely be the type of person that would retire there. If there is ever a work from home position, I would most likely drop what I am doing and go back to work for NYL.","Start pay is not great, but yearly increases and bonuses makes a big difference.

If you see this as a job, then you will not be upset when you have to come out of pocket to pay for things to help you grow your business. I have been with the company now for a year. If you listen to the management team and follow the training program, you can be successful. There is a networking system that you will learn - follow it. The company offers university type training, benefits like group health, dental, vision, and 401K, and management support. In the first year, you get a lot of bonuses to help you build your business. But you must first write a certain amount of business each month to get the extra bonus money. If you do, it helps you survive when money gets low and bills need to be paid. You can get several awards that you must get in your first year. I find that the people who do not hit the ground running, tend to fail. Stay consistent, win awards, and study to find success. This is a great company to build a career but it will not be an easy journey. Find great mentors and stay positive. Do not do this business just to make money because you will fail. I love the industry and I know no matter where I go, putting in the hard work the first 3 to 5 years is crucial. So, because NYL has great products, name recognition, and is a mutual company, I have an advantage.","New York life can do a better job at being transparent in the interview stage of the process.

The established agents are like a bunch of vultures that pretend to be your friend so you can bring them in on your sales because they ran out of their warm markets and they need your sales to help them keep their contract. Also, they do this because there is no field training so your kind of forced to bring them in on your market and split your commission with them. They pressure you to buy policies on yourself and your immediate family and to hit up your family and friends for policies. They require a list of 200 names of people that you know. Once you burn through your warm market you will not make any money. The leads that they sell agents are terrible and your required to purchase their mailers which are very expensive. If you want to work over 50 hours a week, spend a lot of money and make very little then this is the opportunity for you. Your enticed by a training allowance but the policies you write will probably get declined and you will have to work your way out of a negative ledger balance so you will not get the training allowance so you can go months with out any pay after you trigger your contract because those policies will probably get declined. You should ask for a copy of your contract and read it so you will know how much commissions that you will have to make in a month to keep your contract. I do not recommend this type of career for a person who has a family or someone who wants to make a living unless you want to work over 50 hours a week and go months with out money and have a large network of people who you can hit up for policies and sell other services to.",New York Life Insurance

Also, having a senior partner that truly supports you, tremendously helps when you are trying to build your practice. Work-life balance is also a plus, but a double-edged sword.

399,"""Agent""",2.0,55% commission on insurance. Good bonus opportunities if you're able to hit them monthly.,"Their training program is very small, many other firms do it a lot better. From the start they ask you for 75 names before you sign your contract, they are not trying to get leads from you. Once you sign, you're immediately thrown to the wolves. You need to have 10-15 appointments set each week, when I asked what prospecting methods I should use, I was told to go walk business to business, join some networking groups and start using LinkedIn, that was the extent to the guidance I received. So you're expected to know what to do already or ask someone for help. My office was a very competitive environment, so unless you make a friend and share all your business nobody else is willing to work together. Since it's all commission based sales, everyone wants part of your business, and my management had favorites, where they tried to get you to share your business with them. During your 1 on 1, I started to learn that management only documented the negatives from the meeting. For example if you had an outstanding week but lacked in 1 small thing, this was all they would document. I learned from and old partner that they do this, so that if you're not hitting your goals it makes it easier for them to pull your contract. My performance reviews continuously got more and more negative until my partner was screaming at me in his office, this man was not afraid to cuss you out in front of other agents. After dominating my first few months and winning top performer awards, I started to get the feeling that my partner was trying to force me out of the company and pass my book down to one of his favorites and I felt like this was confirmed when 2 other teammates of mine had quit, passed their books down to someone not on this partner's team, and received phone calls harassing them about not giving their book to his favorite. I went to the managing partner to complain about everything and he had no room to take me off the partner's team. This may be slightly unprofessional but in a business where I'm supposed to be my own boss I had to try and take control of my quality of life at work, so I stopped answering calls and emails from the partner, I went to a senior adviser for help, and stopped going to performance reviews, basically cut the partner out completely. This is when my business started to get back on track and when the partner found out that I had a very large client coming in, he reached out to me to try and come up with a plan on working with the client and how he could help. Looking back at the experience, I can't believe that I was treated this way, I have always had good relationships with my team and especially management and performance has never been an issue. During my first few meetings before joining the company they talked about positive experiences and give examples of people who had done extremely well, before choosing this career you need to be realistic, if you can't make this career on your own, it might not be a good idea to try, because you will not be met with the support that you might expect. Also any mandatory training that require you to travel come out of your pocket. Mandatory training in a city 2 hours away, I paid for gas and food.

The TAS(training allowance)is nice because they match 90% of what you make, you have to make something in order to get it though.","Because they are in sales,most mentors have a natural ability to make everything sound glamarous. You are what you make of this position. You will be cold calling your friends, family etc. They have a wonderful process, but people are tricky. You get stood up a lot when you are supposed to have appointments with people and since you only make commission, that affects your pay. I find this to be a bit impractical for someone just starting out. Some sort of a base pay would make more sense. Some months you might make a lot and others you might not make anything at all. Make sure you save 50% of what you are first making starting out so it can help you on the dry months. Usually month 6-8 is a rough time frame because that's when most people run out of their warm markets. They encourage you to get involved, which I agree with. Understand that you will be spending alot of the money you make on gas, on coffee, on food, on printing materials etc. You are essentially a start-up business owner. The catch is that because you are backed by NYL unless you spend 10,000 on miscellaneous expenses for your business, you probably won't receive most of what you spent back in taxes.

453,"""Pyramid Scheme and Hypocritical Management""",1.0,The training is good. Recruiters see you work for NYL and usually are impressed. Company itself is strong financially. Brand recognition helps on appointments. Support staff was always more helpful than management.,"Management plays the favorites game. I've been on both ends of the spectrum for this. Close a big case and you're the hero for the month. You get all the attention and they talk about you in meetings and use you as the ""standard."" On the flip side, have a couple slow months and they try to remedy it by constantly policing you on numbers. So on top of the stress of not being able to pay bills and throwing your own money at driving around for appointments, you have managers (who usually used to be agents) breathing down your neck about making a sale. If you ask for help they just talk at you for half an hour and tell you the same schpeel they give you during your first interview. My big question was always, if being an agent is so lucrative why did they all go into management? I'm sure the word ""salary"" has something to do with it. The commissions are okay, not very competitive with others in the industry. Benefits are astronomical. They charge way too much for ""office fees"" regardless of how much you actually utilize the home office. The whole structure of managing partners and ""teams"" is a bunch of malarkey. There is little to no support from other people on your ""team."" Management uses it to have kum-bay-ah sessions where you say what stressed you out about the week and then your manager just roasts you about it. They try and encourage new agents to work with the established agents, but they usually are just old white men who make you do all the work and take 80% of the commission, without any consequences. I know a personal issue I had was with my licensing, which the admin staff messed up. I ended up having to reapply after having my licenses for two years and had to pay for everything myself with no reimbursement. Because of their mistake. Management pushes product with literally zero shame. If you aren't selling that much life insurance and focus on other areas instead, you'll hear about it constantly. And god forbid if you don't go along with what they tell you. I have been told multiple times that I ""should"" be doing certain things, with a tone used to imply that it won't look good for me if I didn't comply. Which leads into my next complaint. They tell you from day one that YOU are you're own boss. YOU get to make your schedule. YOU set your hours. But then they hand you a class schedule and set up ridiculous amounts of ""admin"" time that you're supposed to be at. Without getting paid. At one point I realized that they couldn't do anything if I didn't come to certain things. When you tell me to go out and sell, I'm going to go out and sell. On my own terms. I've been reprimanded for setting appointments on Mondays/Fridays only for them to apologize once they realize I've made a sale. It makes no sense. On multiple occasions on manager would directly contradict another manager on facts and just overall business practice. It comes across as very unprofessional and doesn't help when your questions end up garnering three totally different answers. Also, if you're doing well, they magically don't care if you aren't showing up to anything, even though they preach to ""surround yourself with success."" So the only people in the office usually are the ones who aren't doing so hot. The biggest red flag that came up was when one manager told me that part of managements business plan is to bring in a bunch of agents with the expectation that a lot won't make it more than a few months, but still have them selling to their close family and friends. So after they leave, those policies go to, guess who? The established agents! Who are already making six figures because they've somehow managed to make it to that point. It's the very definition of a pyramid scheme and I'm actually surprised more people just don't point that out.",New York Life Insurance

When you go in for your 2-3 interviews all information regarding the ""job"" is very vague. They will talk about all of the amazing things they have to offer ie: flexible schedule, money potential, time with family, residuals, awards, bonuses etc. As you start coming on board you attend evening training classes that will teach you how to have ""the conversation"" with the client because you will start off as part time. Once you've ""triggered"" your 1st contract you are then full time and start attending day classes. The information you receive is overwhelming and there is no formal training regarding products or systems. People will talk to you about things, that you've never heard of, as if you should know. On your 1st day you are told to show up and attend a class that no one is expecting you for and no one knows where you're supposed to go, no one even shows you where the restroom or the break room is. I didn't even know there was a break room for months. You are sent to meet and converse with people regarding their finances with no real understanding or training of how to help them. The expectation is that you the ""problem"" back to the office to be review by your Partner and/or team to come up with a ""solution"". This is how they expect you to learn about the product. I could say more but I feel like I'm rambling and whining. I did forget to mention that this is 100% commission, which is not a con in and of itself. But what they don't tell you in the interviews or almost until it's too late is that you have to pay for everything you do out of pocket. If you work an event and have to rent a booth and need supplies you pay. You will be driving a lot, so gas and maintenance costs will increase. If you want anything with company logo you'll need to buy it. I completely understand why they do this. They are preparing you to be a business owner but again none of this is disclosed before you are offered a contract. How is like an MLM? 1. Residuals (a key selling point for every MLM). 2. You are the bottom and report to a ""Partner"" who makes a percentage of what you sell. All the Partners report to a ""Managing Partner"" who makes a percentage of what each of the teams make. If I recruit some one and they are hired (everyone is by the way) I get a percentage of what they make. 3. You can make ""Council"" and there are different levels.

Truth is most are barely making minimum wage. -You're just a number: insurance companies such as this realize that you are more than likely not going to make it but it's no sweat to them. They're still going to receive the residuals from the business you create while you're there so it's a win win for them. The ""world class training"" you'll be provided will be far surpassed by the new business you create before your contact is terminated. -Be ready to work 60 plus hour weeks and travel all across the state with no compensation for your travel expenses in most cases. -Diligence will not get you success: I did everything by the letter making it to the two year mark, which is pretty good in an industry where 90% don't make it past 90 days, and I was laughed at when I did my tax returns.",New York Life Insurance

According to former coworkers they were very nice in the way they handled their layoffs.","If you have someone who can help outline the history for you of why decisions came about, and who the persons of influence are, your chances of doing something useful actually move up to 50% with a lot of hard work and politicking. Change management is virtually never used. One part of a division will enact changes that have huge workload implications for other portions of the division or company, without any thought or prior communication, and other departments are rarely brought to the table to provide feedback or insight. As a result, they are steering the ship without a sextant or a compass. You're lucky if there's an announcement on a board that you _might_ possibly catch and see, but the implications of any communication will not be spelled out in any plain language. Survival hinges on reading between the lines and relentless probing. The technology is ANCIENT. There's no CRM and all communication and problem resolution relies in the form of emails sent through a system that was deprecated over 12 years ago. Reference information, if available at all, is spread so far and wide across so many systems, (Intranet, Sharepoint, Field News articles for agents, multiple internal drives, that's just the tip of the iceberg) that it's nearly impossible to use - how do you know what you don't know? And if you don't know about it, how do you know you need to keep searching for it when one system doesn't have what you need? Workflow is so labyrinthine, and when combined with the information statement above, that new hires take 6 months, minimum, to understand it all well enough to be proficient and effective. They keep eliminating positions and expecting other teams to just pick up the work, without a plan. Upper management doesn't see a problem with this. Even more of a deathknell, upper management is slowly outsourcing every department. They have decided, rather than fixing problems and building a solid company, to just be a company that manages vendors. Human Resources has been pulled back to a ""hotline"" with lots of turnover in that vendor, and all of the problematic learning curves it throws at employees. Accounting has been outsourced (google the news articles yourself.) IT has been pulled back to a ""hotline"" with lots of turnover in that vendor. All IT development is practically done through vendors now. An entire product division, Long Term Care, has been outsourced except for some product managements and vendor managers. The way that was handled makes me wonder if my product division is next.",New York Life Insurance

This is actually a contractual thing where you sign 100+ pages. Here is my personal experience: I was working at New York Life in one city and my wife took a job in another city. We end up moving and the offices within the company compete against each other. The Managing Partners (MP) make money off of agents making money. They tried transferring me to another office but the MPs were fighting over their overrides. They did not care about me and my business. One of the MPs told me that I could not use his office. I was selling New York Life products but I couldn't use the office? I got shuffled around from Partner to Partner until I finally had enough. I resigned. Seven months later no correspondence and I get a letter that I was sent to collections for money that I owe New York Life. No explanation - nothing.

NY Life is truly all about helping people.","The cavalcade of training pulls a lot from your productive time, and as a result, requires you to work like a dog on your own time. This is particularly hard for older, new employees coming into the organization. The ""process"" can be mired in minutia and micro-managing behavior by the trainers and some partners. New candidates would be well advised to speak with other NY Life agents in order to fully vett the real world dynamics of this opportunity. The training includes motivational methods that don't exactly resonate with some of the more mature new agents. If you do not submit to the system and quasi cult-like culture, you will not last long. Your success or failure is heavily dependent on having a great Partner who can relate to you and provide appropriate motivational methods. If you are recruited by a Partner who is not a good fit with you in ideological terms, then your life can get very tense. After your interviews, do not hastily sign on the dotted line, but take your time and do your homework on the person who recruited you. Some Partners revel in using mind ninja games to mold your way of thinking, especially if they sense you are about to wash out. This is because their compensation is partly based on the new agent's production and their retention rate is adversely affected. This mind ninja type of behavior only serves to accelerate the defection of strong willed agents who see through this type of behavior. Sometimes it takes a while to see through the veil of this quasi-brain washing activity, but eventually you come to grips with the fact that you are not aligned with the process and must move on. Some people who washout earlier during Fundamental Career School are typically more in tune with their true gut feelings and can make a quicker change for something that suits them better.

They will allow you to pay for bringing your spouse to their annual holiday party.,"If you join NYLife as a CVP, especially at the MG2 level, this place will drive you absolutely nuts! You’re nothing more than a babysitter of incompetent employees working under the direction of politically conservative isolationists who operate from an old-school top-down management approach. Expect to inherit direct reports that are snarky, entitled, con artists and disrespectful brats. They have no concept of critical thinking or any desire to do real work. Most of my inherited troublemakers (MG1’s) had been with the company for several years and bounced around between various departments, thus by the time I became their babysitter they were accruing over a month of annual vacation. Combined with sick leave, jury duty, summer fun days, bereavement leave, personal days, FMLA and any other ADA or additional extension on accommodations made it nearly impossible to ever hold a staff meeting with my direct reports. The role was basically nothing more than babysitting delinquents and someone to handle angry client calls and correspondence that my boss or anyone else above me in the hierarchy would punt my way because they were too busy with their own political infighting. To make matters worse, NYLife is still on Lotus Notes, which is a navigational nightmare. When hired, I was provided a laptop almost 12 years old that operated antiquated applications. It was nearly impossible to stay connected outside of the office network without having to jerry rig my way online haphazardly. There is not an enterprise CRM solution so most daily correspondence and operations are performed through Lotus Notes or green screens (i.e. antiquated databases). Expect to be inundated daily with hundreds of emails containing tons of chains/threads that you must read through in order to even figure out what is the current topic of discussion. While NYLife does a mediocre job of sourcing talent I was underwhelmed by the level of intelligence with these people (be aware, you will only be sent resumes for what they think is the correct diversity candidate to join the company). Employees hired will spend so much time manipulating how to get out of work that I could never see any substantive value or production coming from anyone. The IS&O organizational leadership (SLT) would promote a top-down management agenda and are all self-congratulating ego maniacs. The leader of this organization himself has a zero open door style and an extremely unapproachable demeanor (E.g. I was partially hired by this person but never once had a skip-level interview, albeit I was required to consistently perform the task with my own teams). He mandates a no work-from-home policy among staff but resides at the Dallas office maybe one day per-week while spending the remainder of his schedule aloof, flying around the country in First Class and enjoying company-paid accommodations/incidentals. In converse, my own boss would scrutinize every T&E transaction from a once per-quarter economy business trip and nominally priced, necessary office supplies. Of course, double standards are the norm and to be expected as NYLife remains a private company with zero transparency. This is not only with T&E but as others on this review board have pointed out, vast majority of promotions and new hire decisions are based on nepotism. If unlucky enough to gain employment outside the nepotism track, expect to have a witch hunt performed on you by both your lifer boss and peers as you will be labeled not part of the insiders’ clique. Combine this with the laddering (E.g. employee stack ranking annual review process) which does nothing but position peers against each other and play shenanigans with allocated bonus and merit dollars - expect to go nowhere except quickly ran off. This will be compounded if you reside and work at a service center based outside of the corporate office as anyone located outside of corporate is viewed as beneath their NYC counterparts. During your recruitment phase, when discussing the bonus program with the less than forthcoming talent team, be sure to inquire where you must stack rank for the year to hit your target bonus illustrated in your offer letter. I actually thought I was going to get dumber working here. The lackluster management training classes (MDI) and so called “success factors training” curriculum my boss would mandatorily enroll MG1’s and CVP’s into, just so he and other SLT leaders could check off on satisfying their yearly KPIs were viewed as pointless and painful. It was a brain drain and distraction from my day-to-day duties of being a productive babysitter. Meetings - the sheer volume was mind bending. None of them critical to doing actual work, more cascading from the SLT on their self-congratulating unearned awesomeness. Bottom line, being political and grandstanding at NYLife is far more important than doing anything value-add while you are there. Anyone serious about doing meaningful work need not apply.

The mandatory meetings can become a nuisance to your schedule. The pay changes each year and that can be a burden (less training subsidy each year--after 3 years it is gone). You take your work home with you and often have little time to account for your family or outside life.

One could make the argument that tradition maintains a family environment in the company. However, while most favored employees are of good character, executive management has turned a blind eye to others who have performed irresponsibly and unethically. In recent years, a handful of executive level employees left NYLIFE with considerable severance packages, despite their conduct. One was the son of a prominent managing partner. Regarding technology, NYLIFE is easily 10 to 15 years behind in basics like account maintenance, fee billing, and CRMs. A decade of rumors that the company will update old technology have been substantiated by stalled and failed efforts. Recently, NYLIFE adopted a program entitled “Technology Transformation”. The primary strategy appears to be informed by labor cost savings rather than replacing legacy systems. The company continues to layoff long-term employees in favor of local and offshore consulting services. (See the 9/29/15 NY Times article which highlights NYLIFE’s practice.)

That's what happened at NYL; I picked up that other agents, with same or less skills than I have (I see it now, after 8 months employment, but I would have missed it early on) with ""gimme"" cases or strong team mentorship, are much more successful. I think the entire time I've worked there, I got one case handed to me, by my manager, and that was a $20 checko or something like that. I worked with another lady, on another team, and offered to team up with her on some shared leads and she responded: ohh no, I'll just work with my partner and not have to split the commission (that is a fact, agents split, agent/manager doesn't split); that blew me away, since my manager rarely does meetings with me, and I rarely get anything handed to me (which means about 1 time in 14 months). I have observed this result with other agents on the same team, most quitting with the first year. This pattern was prevalent with all the ""Exec or Sr. Managers"" who teamed up with agents; the Jr. Managers have more time and more ""shared leads."" (this was outright said to me by my Team manager, so I'm not rationalizing to make myself feel better); Senior Management needs to take a serious look at this, if they want to improve morale with the struggling agents, who are in all other areas, doing well. Pay system is terrible: Too low and too non-funding for early or young/brand new agents Non-reward for class and business sense: One thing I've picked up on is that the seasoned employee (not old, but experienced and bringing class to a situation) is not rewarded; you are almost rewarded for being ""kept down"" and humble. I'm one who isn't intimidated by a big office, or a classy entryway; others are. I think you almost have to be ""bamboozled"" by ""cheesy class"" to be a good employee here. Since my class is natural and my swag comes with the territory, I found I couldn't be ""held down"" in the way I've seen other more successful, albeit lower class acting agents are. Long explanation, but something I picked up on, in just the last few months. The classiest and best agents are the ones that seem to be less successful. NYL seems to attract more rogue, hungry agents, not classy Financial Advisor types. Several times, in a short period, certain ""successful"" agents got fired, for illegal activities. I also saw a manager let go, who had no problem showing off how much he made every month (showed me his check amount); this is very negative, and sends the wrong message, you have to ""cheat to succeed.""

This company really does want to see you succeed, whatever it takes. They'll apparently hire anyone, but the success of the partners is directly connected to the success of their reps. So most of the partners will do anything to see you become successful. They stand by what they say in the contracts. If you do well, you get promoted. If you don't do well, you won't. They really do put the business in your hands. The products are powerful and the need for this service truly exists. I read a lot of reviews that consider this a scam. It's not. Those are generally whiners who don't understand how must insurance and financial institutions work. Initial positions are generally 100% commission based throughout the industry. That is the norm. That doesn't make it a scam. It makes it a sales position. Work harder and stop complaining.","The sales culture can be brutal. Anyone and everyone is a potential sale and once you decide to go home, your business closes. If you didn't get paid that day, oh well. People who come into the business with good connections (either within the company or personally) have a much easier road. They'll make sales or receive extra help while many other reps are left to sink or swim on their own. This means the best reps aren't always the best or most knowledgeable salespeople and advisors. Sometimes, they are simply the best connected. I watched as well connected reps coasted on the business of large clients while I worked nights and weekends to pay my bills and get licensed. The company does nickle and dime you. The commission structure is great, but the operating expenses are also high.

Possibility of making great income with no ceiling.,"They sell the $$ dream very big. You need to find wealthy clients and get them to give you referrals to more wealthy people. You only make commission here, no base. If you sign up someone for a contract and they pay $50 (or whatever number they pay) for it, multiply it by 6 and thats your commission. So for this example you make $300. You also have mileage reimbursement of up $1000 for the month. You have case rate bonus: for every person you sign up to life insurance you get an additional $75 up to 6 people for the month. So thats another $450 you could make, but you can only trigger this if you get a least 3 to sign up for the month. You also have something called Training Allowance, which is a bonus of up to $2,800 your first year per month. So lets say you made $5000 on commission for the month. You multiply it by 80% and that your Training allowance for the month. In this example it would be $4000 but you would only receive your max of 2,800 that month. So as you can see, very lucrative, but only if you sell sell sell!! THEY MAKE YOU SELL TO YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. And you will more than likely be buying policies on yourself to make commission and to qualify for events which isnt good to do. You invest in them before they do in you. Its all about selling, they do not give you leads, only if you have been with the company for some time and qualified for certain income numbers by year end. Life insurance is unfortunately something that people are not interested in right now. especially young people. So you will be having to do a lot of convincing to people. Everyone should have it, but its not a marketable product. And its hard to position because yes, they should have the life insurance, but yes you also need to be making your money, so its a hard thing to do with close people and the business. They could sometimes feel that, and you could get desparate at times and ruin some close friendships at times. Its also awkward because you will be calling some people that you havent talked to in years, and they will be surprised as hell that you are calling them....and that you are calling them all of sudden, due to business! And there is no way around it, they will know. So if you could get past all of that, and being on the phone asking people for apppointments, then youre good. If you dont want to call your friends and would like to cold call so be it. You dont need a college degree for this position, so if you dont have one, then its something great to do, if not, get some education and find a position where you can grow and move up in this world.

1090,"""Financial Services Professional""",3.0,"The more you produce, the more you earn. It's as simple as that. Hard work is not directly related to success, but it certainly helps. The new hire program is pretty good for the industry, though it is solely contingent on you selling. You receive an 80% bonus on all sales up to a limit your first year, 45% the second year, and 25% in your third year. Going back to production - the more you sell, the more perks you receive. The perks include but are not limited to: annual trip if quota is made, growing expense allowance, a retirement pension that vests after 5 years, etc. The payouts are pretty fair for the industry. You are approximately compensated 50% on all first year premium sold on life insurance products and approximately 4% on annuities sold. If you don't care that you are selling potentially crappy products in an improper way, with a poor understanding of what you're doing -- then the opportunities are limitless and you will be handsomely rewarded.","Selling mutual funds is allowed but not exactly championed. Brokering out business, such as disability, health, etc, isn't exactly championed either. While they claim to be advisors, the vast majority of the company (I'd reckon 95%+) aren't anything more than annuity wholesalers or life insurance peddlers. The common claim is that ""something is better than nothing"" when selling a client, but often times the case is one where the agent/rep did a disservice through poor insight, advice, etc. There is little real guidance other than the product training and marginal manager oversight. The chief concern for managers is retention in the first year or so and the ability to hit minimum production requirements. Beyond that, there is little assistance or guidance. From my experiences with managers, I'd say few of them are real advisors and were nothing more than glorified sales reps who met quotas and decided to get a salary because they didn't want to grind it out anymore. It should be noted that you are required and encouraged to leverage your friends and family to sell in the beginning. It makes sense because they are more likely to trust and want to help you. But the real reason is because they're the most likely suspect to convince for a quick sale. While it may benefit to a degree, often times it's done improperly because the agents aren't really qualified. I would say at least 80% of new agents under 3 years have no background in finance and are pushed to sell serious financial products without any real merit of knowledge themselves about the industry or ramifications of the products they sell. This even goes for senior agents. Even guys with 5-15 years experience are hardly qualified to be speaking about financial-related matters yet because they took in-house training and passed 1-2 tests -- then they are held out to be experts. It's a shame. Occasionally a good agent/representative comes along because of pure circumstance and chance, but they often don't stay because of the industry and move on to a more proper use of their time and expertise. I'd be surprised if more than 5% of the industry could be trusted for sound financial advice.",New York Life Insurance

My office was a considerable distance from my home, so I rarely went into the office without a plan.

Oftentimes, the management would tell us about required weekend hours with little advanced notice, and vacation time had to be scheduled so far in advance to ensure that the phones were covered, it almost seemed pointless to try and take the time at all. Besides that, the turnover rate left the center with only a few reliable veterans, and they often were promoted to the more advanced departments after a year or so, leaving the front lines full of new trainees.

You can get 'hired' if you have a pulse and can name one friend or relative with a bank account.","'Salary' described in interviews is not a real salary. Entirely commission based. ""Management's"" idea of support is creating new ways for you to get new clients, by paying them a fee. You are entirely disposable, and the minute you don't make required sales figures, your manager will ignore you. You pay for EVERYTHING. Want to work in the office? Cubicle: $____ a month. Phone line: $____ a month. Use some equipment to promote the company: $____ each time. You will be told to go to MANDATORY meetings to hear about new 'GAME-CHANGERS' that you are told will bring in big clients at some catering hall....if you pay $100 for entry. If you enjoy living in a cult that requires your time, assets and loyalty, you may enjoy it here. Even if you are out selling a lot of policies, you are expected to go to multiple meetings a week. The company uses a CHILD ID Program to make Child IDs for school groups / youth sport leagues to get new parents (yes, you pay to use the machine as an agent too). The information parents give them is strictly for marketing purposes. Any information taken on the child is not given to police, so in the event your child goes missing, the parent would still need to give police the child's info, and the Child ID kit is only good for matching up fingerprints on a dead body. (Sad, but true.) In all of the history of the Program, not one was ever used for an Amber alert or other child incident. Like many sales jobs, you are expected to go out and get a client base yourself, so this usually means bugging your family or friends. If you don't find a consistent number of new wealthy clients, the company doesn't care. They can always give your clients to another agent. If client ends a policy, they want your COMMISSION BACK. This company seems to be the one that was run by old white men until 200_, who suddenly looked around and said ""What are these things all around me? We should try selling to them."" when they saw a woman, a minority, or homosexual. As a result, the company has several initiatives to get more clients from minority groups, but such groups are talked about as if they were some sort of ""lesser"" person. If you are, say, a gay African American, they would love to have you as an agent, because then you could maybe get clients from ""those black people"" or ""those gay people"" (substitute any adjective for a slur if the door is closed). (I heard one of the marketing people talk about ""creating _______ wealth in the ________ community"" as if buying life insurance would defeat discrimination.) Company will hold raffles of items at events, then not actually hold the raffle, or choose a winner only if a person entering has interest in a $5,000,000 policy (who of course ""wins"" the raffle). All in all, not the place to be if you are honest, in need of a regular paycheck, or if you want to be treated as an individual. Enrollment in a military program will net you more income, stability, and a sense of doing something good with your life. Oddly enough, you would probably feel more satisfied as an individual then you would at NY Life. ---- Oh, almost forgot, expect some shill to say 'The person didn't put in the hard work and that's why they didn't make it.""

Everywhere you go, you are thinking about networking to get those people to become your clients. It can become overwhelming and you reach a point where you're not always being genuine, but just in it to build your business (and help others in the process - because you are really helping others with your services IF you truly know what you're doing).

1328,"""Great company, horrible career path""",1.0,"New York Life, is a sound Life Insurance company with the highest ratings and upmost integrity. I didn't have to pay for anything except study material (i was told I would be reimbursed once ive passed the test which i never received). One of the best things that I can say about working here was the development managers, these guys are top notch and are very helpful, knowledgeable as well. They have been in my shoes so they know everything that goes on. Their new organization and team meetings are extremely helpful.","My point-person also known as my recruiter was a scum bag, I know that this does not reflect on the agency or company itself but all recruiter use the same methods and tactics. You will be told that you are taking the position as a ""financial services profession"" when in reality you are a life insurance salesman. Sure you are able to do a plethora of other services but your quotas are based and paid life insurance cases and if you are not maintain those then you are gone. When you first start out you are under a P-TAS contract, which means that you must bring in a certain amount of cases and commissions within 6 months or you will be gone. This is also a commission based position, which means you eat what you kill, but not when you kill it. You if you do bring in cases, the money is held until one of two things happen, you either resign, or you get your TAS (which is basically your second contract once you've completed your first). If any of your clients cancel their policy within 6 months, that commission will be reversed. Printing and many other materials were free but If you really want to step your game up you will have to buy the premium products to impress your prospects. You will also have to find your own prospects. I do not recommend this position unless you know alot of people with money or unless your parents are rich. If none of these apply, look else where. If you choose not to then you will have to cold call, go door to door, do events, and pray that you make it.",New York Life Insurance

The bar is pretty low: so much there is the result of","Extremely bureaucratic--no one can make any decision for themselves, so be prepared for just about everything to get stalled out in committee meetings. Speaking of meetings...it's a place where more time is spent talking about work than doing any work: meetings to discuss other meetings are not only common, they're encouraged. Internal growth is a tricky proposition, since the company has a policy of never increasing salary more than 10%, regardless of position change. As a result, it's common for talented people to leave, then return so they can get paid what they're worth. It's not a company that encourages much bonding. There are no team lunches, happy hours, team building activities or clubs. As would be expect for a company that's been around since the 1840s, there's a lot of entrenched management, philosophies and group thinking. It's a place where the oldest idea usually wins, not the best.

It is very hard to make a living and pay your bills if you refrain from backstabbing your fellow Agents. In fact, that seems to get you noticed and offered Partner positions. You sign a contract that basically says that you are an independent business owner except when they want you to be their ""beck and call"" person. If you are interested in the industry, please look at the other top-rated insurance firms or start someplace else where you come in with solid experience (then, you most likely wouldn't choose NYL). The office environment is very misogynistic. Finally, almost all of the favorable reviews for Agent positions appear to have been written by Partners (whose primary responsibility is to recruit), therefore, take those with a massive grain of salt.",New York Life Insurance

They do not care if you are sick, diagnosed with cancer, have to have surgery, etc. Everytime you are out of the office is just another inconvenience for them. Borderline sociopathic behavior is acceptable apparently - no empathy or compassion. ***For a such a huge company, I would think even a satellite office like the one I worked at would have a better office environment. Ours has a ""break room"" that consists of a disgusting, moldy, old fridge, a microwave with all kinds of old food petrified inside it, 1 table, a few lopsides chairs that are falling apart, and absolutely no eating utensils or supplies. Plus, as office staff, you can't even go eat in the break room unless you want to be harassed by agents about their cases all during your lunch break. ***You do not stand out at NYL unless you are a sleazy sales agent that is raking in mega bucks for the company. Nevermind that the office staff has to have that agent correct a million mistakes on his app because he was too busy selling the dream to be thorough...Also, management does hardly anything for the office staff. The agents are taken out to big lunches, celebrations, lunches here in the office, various company vacations around the US, etc. but the office staff? Nothing. No ""good job"" or ""thank you"" or ""I appreciate you going out of your way to finish that one case."" ***Not all, but a LOT of agents can be incredibly inconsiderate, by not turning any business whatsoever in the entire month, but then the last day, turn in 5 apps 30 minutes before the office closes.

Training is horrible too, no direction, the material is out of date and the trainers are horrible. Upper management is way out of touch.
