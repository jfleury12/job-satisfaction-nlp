The company also has a lot of fantastic professional development benefits - again, if you're proactive and willing to work, you can really develop the skill set that you want.","The health benefits are outrageously expensive compared to both my and my significant other's previous jobs. Many perks (pension, home office expenses for those who primarily work out of an office, the retirement payout schedule, and more) have been cut over the last year which continues to impact employees well-being. Furthermore, with the company having a very down year on the market, there has been a sharp increase in the number of layoffs in several business units which has fed into a developing culture of fear and mistrust. Biggest con that I can think of - last year, GE found a way to literally take a paycheck from American employees at Christmas. The company has a bi-weekly payout schedule for your salary which means twice a year you have a month with three paychecks. GE, in an effort to get in front of changing OT laws, decided to move the last paycheck of the year to the following week.

302,"""GE could be so much better""",3.0,"I've worked with various GE business for 25+ years and have had amazing opportunities, successes, and career highlights. I've also been incredibly lucky. Overall GE has great people. There really are no slackers, although you will of course come across sociopaths here and there, especially those on the fast track. Try to avoid them. Enjoyment of one's work at GE (or anywhere) can very much depend on the local team dynamic and the skill of the local leader to nurture and energize the team. Vacation policies have improved, with Senior Professional Band and above now on permissive leave programs where one is simply allowed (with manager approval) to take the time off they need. Note that this works well when the employee is comfortable taking time off and the manager agrees with the amount of time off that the employee wants, but I fear that many younger employees may be afraid to take time off if they think it might make them look less dedicated than their peers. If you have any concerns, my suggestion is to find a mentor to coach you in this. Folks that have been around a while are well-calibrated to how much time off is reasonable.","Surviving a career at GE involves dodging a lot of bullets. While this has become somewhat normal in corporate America, GE was among the first to perfect the art of shedding large masses of people. GE makes proud claims of being a meritocracy, but most job loss events are unrelated to performance. If you are in a business that is doing well, you MIGHT be okay but even then there are too-frequent seismic shifts. Several times in my career I created amazing teams with clear purpose, uptake, and customer impact, but constant change always seemed to disrupt forward momentum short of the potential. Of all the people I've worked with, I would say that ~80% were pushed out for one reason or another. Very few make it to natural retirement. GE still CAN be a good place to spend a few years, but is probably best viewed as a launch pad. Finally, while salaries are fine, GE's healthcare benefits are pretty bad, and retirement healthcare benefits are simply not affordable (but most won't retire from GE anyway). Note that as of this review (August 2017) GE is in the midst of significant turmoil due to: (1) financial under-performance; (2) activist investor pressure; and (3) change in CEO. It may take a couple of years for the new CEO to get things back on track, and I suspect the process will involve substantial change.",General Electric

You are expected to be a mind reader and ""on-call"" at all times. They don't tell you during the interview that required OT involves weekends *and* holidays. In over 15 years in accounting and finance, this is the first organization that has required me to work on all major holidays. Work/life balance means we will allow you to recoup your time later, but family and friends are rarely able to wait for a week or two until you can recoup your time to take off and celebrate with them. Almost everyone in the Global Ops Center in downtown Cincinnati is new. This means that very few people really have a solid framework of information about the organization in order to make informed decisions or to inform others in their decisions. I quickly learned to not take other people at their word as most are quick to give the impression that their opinion is correct without considering that the siloed nature of information within this organization makes it nearly impossible for any one person to fundamentally know anything about which they speak if it isn't in reference to their microscopically specific responsibilities. The workspace is touted as a collaborative environment, and yet it does not lend itself well to collaboration among team members without finding a meeting space. Alternatively, there is not privacy or quiet space for thinking unless you grab a phone room. Perhaps workspaces within each group would allow for more active huddling. Functions within the same business are spread out over several different floors and spaces, where having everyone sit together in the same space would make more logical sense from a collaboration standpoint. Departments and functions feel very disjointed. ""Change is the only constant"" is a favorite phrase around the office, but the momentum of change that is occurring doesn't allow for people to adapt and become experts at anything before moving on to the next shiny system or tool meant to ""streamline"" processes...that no one has even had an opportunity to establish in the first place. ""Not your grandpa's GE"" is also another favorite phrase. While I admire progress and innovation, perhaps taking some notes from Grandpa's GE with regards to structure, guidelines and foundational organizational processes would have been beneficial instead of sending Grandpa to the nursing home and essentially writing him off. Bigger is not always better. They lure applicants in with attractive salaries only for them to find out that 60+ work weeks are the norm and the salary isn't that lucrative at all, once you do the math. Benefits are industry norm - nothing to write home about. Employees must pay for their own parking (GE discount).",General Electric

There are always emerging businesses, things to do, leaders to learn from. - This is the only company I have worked for that I have recommended to Friends - I do not regret leaving as after being at GE for many years, I was recruited out for an opportunity I could not refuse. I found the skills learned at GE to be superior in many ways in operations, leadership, finance, Quality, Innovation, Collaboration, Human Capital and HR. Other companies have not compared. Now nearing retirement, I mentor and encourage students to highly consider a career at GE.","Only one con and regret is that you get sucked in so deep that you do forget to have a life and you never get the time back.

456,"""Used to be good, but activist investors are ruining it for the employees""",1.0,"Dedicated to integrity. Interesting work. Respectable company with good management. I love GE, I love what we do, and I love what the company stands for. We're not afraid to make bold moves, and despite a heavy burden of bureaucracy, we do big, important, world-changing things. We are transforming factories and machines for the digital era by instrumenting them with sensors, connecting them to a homegrown cloud platform, and helping our partners to build transformative apps to improve their businesses based on analysis of the data ... and if that by itself weren't enough, we make trains, planes, and power plants while were at it. So when I write this review, know that it's with a heavy heart - I always have, and still do LOVE GE, what we do, and what the company stands for, and I will do everything in my power to make sure that GE returns to not only a company that does great things, but also great place to be while getting them done.","Our cash flow on industrial operations was bad last quarter. Lay people off, oust the CEO, set aggressive targets tied to exec bonuses bad. This in itself isn't a con - businesses have cycles, industry waxes and wanes, and along the way there will be hirings and firings, business class and coach, fat raises and thin. We all understand this, and I don't begrudge the company letting people go of people to make ends meet. We all make cutbacks in our lives when times are hard, the government should do it, and corporations -have- to do it. I don't even begrudge the board the executive bonus increases and decreases that are tied to the 2017 and 2018 1B savings targets -- targets that big have to be driven from the top down, hard decisions need to be made, and if the right decisions are made intelligently, they've earned their bonuses. In fact, were I in Jeff Immelt's shoes with an activist investor breathing down my neck demanding my job, I'd make many of the same moves he's making. So why the 1 star review, when I love the company, understand the cuts, and agree that we need to get back to positive cashflow? The cut the already miserly 'above and beyond' bonus program. While this in itself isn't a big deal, it signals to me that the management layers have given up on morale, engagement, and everything that goes with it. The bang-for-buck of employee activities like affinity groups (which have also had their funding cut), holiday parties, and 'thank-you' bonus programs is unmatched, and to see these things go means that not only have they made cuts with heavy hearts, they've moved to a point where they just don't care about morale among the rank-and-file anymore. For this reason, I can only recommend that you stay away until better times return.",General Electric

Many of us took issue with their stated devotion to customers, when quite the opposite was true. This was discouraging as corners were cut in the quality department in order to provide the goods, which often were sub-standard. That's not to say that the general employee base was responsible, but decisions made at the top often disregarded the downstream product quality. Operating from a manufacturing-based philosophy left the projects-based businesses GE acquired with a negative: the proverbial square peg in the round hole.

I never felt like the smartest person in the room, but I never worked with an idiot either. I can't emphasize how important it is to have a company where people are taught management skills. This means that the worst manager can get called on the carpet and send to ""work on his/her skills"" - so the overall culture is one where baseline management skills are relatively high.

When you get a chance take 10 mins and google some of the things GE sells. Jet engines nuclear reactors automation software ultrasonic and MRI machines. These are things that unequivocally benefit people. Now google top startups and look at some of the stuff they're doing...it's probably yet another ""ground-breaking"" app that lets you deliver food or schedule grooming for your cat or dog. This feeling outwardly manifests itself in the culture where your coworkers (across all departments- engineering sales marketing) will be passionate about their work and the business. They will generally be proud of contributing to technology that can be universally appreciated and not just for one niche purpose or clique. This isn't exactly easy to find at tech companies these days (trust me?) You're also likely to get fantastic work life balance, BUT varying from business to business since GE is so large. Managers get legit leadership training and it no doubt costs the company $$$. It is noticeable, and does have a positive effect on the perceived and actual work/life balance when your team is well-managed. The longer you stay the more likely you are to get paid training and covered travel.","the bureaucracy. Hands down. This is a BIG company. There's a saying about the left arm not knowing what the right arm is doing. GE is like an octopus where its every tentacle for itself. they've tried to fix this in recent years by being more ""lean"" but, unfortunately, it's just ingrained in the middle and upper level management to have more process rather than less. This may take decades to fix, if ever. you WILL be forced to engage in the latest and greatest organizational fad like 'Scrum' (previously Six Sigma. maybe soon to be Microservices) even if it makes absolutely no sense for the project at hand OR it is proving to be overly time consuming and ineffective. Not all sub businesses are created equal at GE and some are just way worse than others at staying ahead of the curve and not getting bogged down in endless processes. This may not be the best place for the young and brash - be prepared for moments where you simply cannot be productive because of your environment.

This was called ""getting your lunch money stolen,"" so they even had a term for the phenomena. The culture is also insular: training (including company sponsored MBA programs) is done at GE-only facilities; I did attend one training session where outside businesses were discussed, but mostly the topics were GE-centered, so there was a limited opportunity to learn how others do it; best practice sharing was across GE...very little with others; non-GE-run training was discouraged.

There is no more employee buying discount on top of the friends and family pricing however. GE also has a great rewards program where you can nominate your hard working co-workers for gifts cards or cash.","HR made some bad decisions recently. They froze all salaries for senior level employees for a minimum of 3 years (could be longer) to implement a bonus program. They did not give you an option to opt out. The biggest issue is the goals to get a bonus are extremely difficult and conflicting. They've also decide ""co-location"" is important. The problem is they didn't co locate people with who they really work closely with everyday. They also put folks from real offices (walls, doors, windows) into cubicles that are loud and distracting. It's a global company, so you are working with people all around the world. You can't hear them on your conference calls with this awful setup. There is no such thing as work-life balance. I've seems multiple people moved to new positions and the old positions now is responsible for two full time jobs. I was actually given three. Supply chain and product management get blamed any time something goes wrong even if it's not their fault. Top management will talk about what great teams we have in meetings of 300+ people when referring to sales, but in the same breath tell them all how bad supply chain is.

The end result is that others have to pick up the slack. In the worst cases, those not carrying their weight are older ""tenured"" employees who have a lot of influence, but are slowing down progress with their lazy attention to detail and mistakes. I'd assume this can happen at any very large organization, however. Another issue is the uncertainty of the pay structure, raises, bonuses, and promotions. There is no clear definition for when or how any of those are setup and decided. Speaking with a few people, there is a general feeling that raises and promotions are at best based on some level of favoritism, and at worst arbitrary. These forms of compensation clearly depend on how well your manager fights for you in closed-door leadership meetings, and not necessarily on performance. So depending on your manager and program, you may get promoted regularly and fairly...or you may work hard and sit in an entry level position for 8 years.

Also, it is difficult to move up in the company past a certain point. It seems you have to start out of college in one of the programs, and/or join the Corporate Audit staff, to gain the visibility needed to move up. That can be frustrating for people who joined from an acquisition, and who bought into the GE culture and message very early on.

GE Capital, Commercial Finance, former VFS (Vendor Financial Services), etc. Others, not so much. I was fortunate that Jack Welch was CEO for approx. 67% of my career with GE. Throughout this era employees BELIEVED in GE Values, embraced fantastic training tools such as Six Sigma, CAP (Change Acceleration Process), Leadership Training. Customer Satisfaction (referring to internal customers..GE Employees who engaged IT Client Services for support) was top priority. Employees/Teams worked in the office..together..engaged everyday with various teams. I loved getting up in the morning and going to work. Goals and Objectives were established during the first quarter of every year based on solid data. Projects/Tasks made sense. If an employee was a top performer there was no doubt she/he was on a solid, very timely career path. to be continued below.","Then Mr. Welch left. All GE Capital IT employees were transferred to a centralized IT department under GE Corporate for phase one of the OneGE initiative. A centralized IT group serving all GE Verticals. Only a select one or two small GE divisions (small in regards to number of employees, but extremely integral to GE as a whole), Sigal Zarmi, one of the few female CIO's in Corporate America had the vision and foresight and COURAGE to push back. While the rest of GE IT..now Corporate IT..disintegrated quite rapidly with multiple cost cutting initiatives, outsourcing, so many re-orgs and name changes, team changes..impossible to keep count. Morale of the majority of IT personal desperately treaded water but couldn't hold out. It began sinking and continues to sink to this very day. GE Values mean nothing, Spirit letter means nothing. Don't take my word for it..survey Corporate IT employees. Give them the following list of GE Core Values that drive Leadership and employees to excel. *Strong Work Ethic: Valued employees who work hard and work smart *Dependable/Reliable: Take Accountability for the teams they lead or projects they manage *Positive Attitude and Embracing Change *Adaptable and Flexible: Projects don't always go as planned. Adapt, think outside of the box, and motivate your team. Ask them to rate them in order of importance. Also give them an option to rate ALL of them as EQUALLY IMPORTANT. Now lets make a charitable David vs Goliath bet. Me v.s. Glassdoor. $5000 donated to the charity of choice. I will wager that over 94% will select the option that All of them are equally important. It does not matter how many employees actually rate them. My wager? Less than 6% will reply back that the values listed are important but are NOT the GE CORE Values that are critical to the growth and success of General Electric The real GE Values which truly ARE critical when INDIVIDUAL Goals and Objectives are identified in a one one one meeting with a manger. They are the following: External focus Show imagination and courage Drive inclusiveness, Have expertise Clear thinkers Most teams are virtual, in silos, have no idea what related teams are doing. The teams that were outsourced work in sweat shop environments. They are treated as lepers, beaten with a stick, not embraced as teammates. In my last months at GE, after engaging HR and the Ombudsperson because my boss was a bully, a former Army vet who treated employees as if they were in the Army at boot camp, not part of a team. Sticking up for the team who STRONGLY advised me NOT to go to HR as it is the kiss of death and told me flat out they would plead the fifth if approached. They all advised me to shut up, collect the paycheck, pay the bills, and be grateful I have a job. I couldn't do that. I dreaded going to work each day. I was depressed..desperately searched for another job at GE and FOUND a perfect fit. But it was AFTER I went to HR. I was not allowed to move. I was put on a performance plan. When I was informed by my boss that I was being put on a performance plan (even though I achieved ALL my Goals and Objectives along with additional stretch goals) I explained that I needed a change after working for 4 years on a team that was constantly in flux, no stability, four managers in four years...my manager informed me that I COULD interview for the position, saw no reason why I couldn't move but he wanted to discuss it with HR first. End result, I was NOT allowed to interview..was put on a plan. The rest is history. I could literally write a book about Corporate IT. It would be incredibly entertaining. Solidly backup my claims with data. The scandal stories alone would make it a best seller. I decided not too because I am grateful for the fantastic managers I had in my early years.

Go play golf with their other manager friends. Play ""angry birds"" at their desk during work time. BUT if you want to take 1-2 days off they question you. OR they tell you that ""now is not the best time to take 1 day off"" ... unbelievable!!!! 2- Again, managers DO NOT care about their employees. Whether something has been done properly or not does not matter to them. Whether their employees are happy or not does not matter to them. They take credit off of your every accomplishment as if they have anything to do with it, but when something goes wrong, they will burn you at the stake. They just want to get promoted and have big fat raises to their salaries. 3- When upper management make mistakes, workers, and engineers pay the price! As an engineer, my job is to build the engine as good as I can. As a manager your job is to find a customer for this engine. IF as a manager you can not find a customer, THEN it is your fault. Please resign your position to someone more competent. But nooooo ... those who are at the bottom of the packing order pay the price of the poor management. 4-It is a good company if you want to get a job straight out of college with bachelors degree. If you have a masters or phd, DO NOT even bother, your education or experience will not be valued at all ... you will take orders from someone who does not even know the science behind how things work inside the engine just because that person has been in the company more than you do. 5- There is too much bureaucracy! in order to get one simple task done, you have to fight with numerous people. 6- If you are planning to come here to work, you'd better be good at kissing a lot of a$$, agreeing with everything that your seniors tell you, or you will not get any raise/promotion any time soon. 7- The company is located in a VERY conservative area, and most of the employees are also very conservative and biased towards those come to the company outside the south (especially north east or the west). 8 - Check the stock values, since 2008 stock values of GE's competitors went back to their original value. Yet, GE is still half price. Obviously something is not going right. Instead of replacing those who put the company at it's current position, they are laying people off ... sure!!! lay people off ... then waste money and hire clueless new graduates ... train them ... waste money ... then lay them off to cover your mistakes ... :) 9- benefits? what is that mean? you will get the cheapest health insurance out there ... you will have to work on national holidays ... you will get the worst retirement benefits too ... GE cuts from its employees, so it can offer a sweet retirement to upper management ... i.e. check John Krenicki's retirement deal ... what did he do to deserve such a sweet deal? Did he invent the gas turbine? 10- The corporation made $14 billion dollar profit last year, but did not pay taxes ... what is the deal? why? I pay my taxes ... 11-I finally had enough and applied for positions in GE's competitors. Currently I work for a competitor in Jupiter Florida, and get paid $15K more :) I have better health and retirement benefits.

Health plan was really good but now average due to high-deductible plan. Vacation plan is on par, was above average but reduced to par a few years ago. Pension plan is very good, but I suspect will be brought down to par in the next few years. Actual work time ('casual overtime') is on par, but could vary widely depending on what projects are involved with. Fairly easy to change job positions if want to completely leave current role, but may become more difficult to improve pay or position within existing organization. Job security is generally good. Cooperative with personal time-off type issues.","Poor leadership. I know that GE was known for great leadership, but those days are currently gone. There is a lack of long term vision of where want products to go, what customers want to serve, and how to get there. Long term projects struggle for years with little leadership engagement, and then leaders become surprised when crunch time comes and deadlines are missed. There is a lack of communication between leaders of different organizations, locations, etc. Professional confrontation that is sometimes required to resolve an issue is always pushed down to the engineer level for resolution, leaders are terrified to (professionally) confront another leader for fear of bad labels... in other words, there is a big incentive to keep things swept under the carpet. Incredible amount of bureaucracy. Simple tasks that used to take an educated decision by a few smart engineers with some involvement of some more senior engineers now require multiple levels of managers, consulting engineers, chief engineers, technical leaders, etc. Chief engineers have a very confrontational tone as well as have difficultly in accepting new ideas but at the same relentlessly push their new ideas even though not completely thought through. PowerPoint culture. Inordinate amount of time spent in PowerPoint. In theory the idea is that the PowerPoint slides summarize your work in order to communicate progress, risks, etc. Instead, all of the good engineering work that was done has to be force fit into a presentation tool so that the disengaged leadership chain and levels of bureaucracy can try to understand the basic concepts of what is going on. If you are good at PowerPoint you can go far in GE, but if you want to continue to sharpen your engineering skills you will otherwise find that they will become rusty mostly due to this. Difficult to get through to real customers. If you had previous industry experience, will likely be more comfortable in ability to make decisions, understand what is going on, and push for what you think is right for customers. Otherwise, customer's needs are filtered and passed down through multiple layers, ultimately leading to lowered customer expectations. Additionally, a culture has developed amongst those with less direct industry and customer experience, where they have become leaders that are setting direction for product offerings, design decisions, etc but clearly are missing the mark. This in turn also leads to the previous comment of rusty engineering skills, where the rank-and-file become out of touch with industry standards, customer expectations, etc. Additionally, things such as attending a conference or sitting on an industry standards board are reserved for a select few. Lack of team mentality. This is something simply have to accept in a 'meritocracy' such as GE. You are constantly conscious of your yearly EMS (yearly personnel review process), where more or less have to create a resume of accomplishments every year. On the surface it makes sense to put down your accomplishments to refresh the minds of those who determine pay raises, but it is clear that once it goes up one or two layers in the chain of command that any great individual or team efforts become less significant in lieu of name recognition. Hopefully didn't come across as too negative. In general probably on par with other large corporations. However, currently falling behind our competition, leadership is currently on a down-slide, but as in everything in GE this can go in cycles and has the ability to improve if becomes a recognized problem.",General Electric

Supposedly, it looks good on resume","No matter how much you try, managers are never happy with your work. They are very good at finding excuses to rank you low. The good job you do is rarely acknowledged. You are more discouraged than encouraged. Managers and technical leaders are technically weak. Instead of looking at what you are doing right, they are trying to find excuses to demoralize you and degrade your work. It is not what you bring new to the table, not how well you do your job, not how much technically competitive you are, it is how you kiss their @ss and how you look like as if you are working. It is very bureaucratic. Career advancement is only for upper level managers and for them to get the promotions. If you are starting fresh with little or no experience, GE is a place to stay away unless you have other offers. It would be a good place to work to learn the tools which are beneficial to engineers and gain some experience and get the hell out. All work is outsourced to contractors. Salary is not competitive and compared to the amount of hours you put in to GE, it does not justify. Family life? what is it? who cares? You have to be willing to dedicate your life to GE.

GE Energy is a stable company.","You get the large, impersonal corporate atmosphere. The interns are hired by Human Resources for one reason: to be a pipeline for the development programs. As a result, managers and work groups are typically ill prepared to provide interns with the training, assistance, and work necessary for a successful engineering internship. You will probably be stuck with the boring work nobody else has the time to do. If you are interested in a direct hire position in this economic situation, forget it. There is no incentive to improve the intern program because most of the interns will not be hired for full-time positions. Management that is several pay bands above you calls the shots. For the technical engineer, there is little room for creativity. It is hard to quantify job performance in technical engineering roles as compared with manufacturing roles. GE is resistant to change as seen in some analysis tools used that are decades old. Many engineers are unhappy with their assignments and are overworked. They stick around because they are married and GE provides a stable job. You are expected to work more than 40 hours a week with no overtime pay so that deadlines are met.

Those who try to work 40 hours a week are typically out of the company in less than 2 years. In addition to the lack of training and work-life balance, employees of GE are typically paid less than their counterparts at major competitors. Because GE has such a strong reputation world-wide, GE Human Resources managers know they can offer less to employees, expect more out of them, and people will still come and work for GE, at least in the short-term. Because of the lack of training, work-life balance, and adequate pay, the turnover I've seen at GE has been very high. I have seen 2 managers and 3 sales engineers leave in the last 3 years.

If you are willing to put in long hours at times, and are motivated by the mission of creating dependable, high-quality aircraft engines, than this might be a business worth considering in your future career. Further, as a globally recognizable brand, being at GE allows you the professional flexibility to expand your workscope into one of many industries and across many companies -- after working at GE -- if you so choose. Beyond the name recognition, if you choose to stay in-company, the large conglomeration of businesses under GE Corporate allows you to have many different career opportunites while staying within the same umbrella. This i turn lends itself towards benefits such as being able to literally travel the world and work at various sites, within GE.","First and foremost, GE as a company likes to get the most work out of its employees that it can for the amount they pay you. This means two things: first, it means that you may be required to work incredibly long hours -- including nights and weekends -- to get the job done. It also means that your pay probably isn't going to be competitively comprable to colleagues in other companies. This is the payoff you choose when you enter one of the largest companies in the world. Another issue is that GE is at best inconsistent about employee recognition for hardwork and innovation: This is contrary to the stateed culture and purported focus of managers. I have seen numerous instances where managers have blatently overlooked great projects done by colleagues -- in one instance, the CFO of my division neglected a large cost-savings project because the project corrected a problem the CFO had originally created earlier in the year, and the officer didn't want a spotlight on a problem that was his fault.",General Electric

If you are not an engineer you are considered a “backroom function”. You do not have an equal sit at the table when it comes to big decisions unless you are with a group of your own (i.e. Finance with Finance, Sales with Sales, etc…). It’s a very intense environment where nothing really gets accomplished. Informatin systems are just as legacy as the business mentality. In an HQ role you will probably push PowerPoint presentations back and forth for 6 months not really influencing the underlying information (it’s usually the same data with different cuts) but definitely making sure you appear to do so. We used to call this sort of science… “the art of chartology”. The Energy business is very bureocratic, slow, un-innovative and there is a huge disconnect between the HQ ivory tower and what really goes on in the field. GE promotes the fact that you “own your career”… and you do. If you want to progress within the company ranks it comes down to how well you are able to build and use your network. “What about working hard and delivering?” you may ask. To that I would say “Never mind that! Focus on building your network, developing your delegation skills, having an elevator speech and identifying the right people to hang around… if there is time left crunch some numbers and send some emails” Business are reorganized on an annual basis. The main reason usually is to hide nasty losses and performance under the rug of a better performing unit. Growth/Promotions – 95% of the elements needed for promotion are the standard ones when it comes to big bureaucratic organizations. Some of these elements are making sure you save “face”, be a master chartologist, know the right people (and kiss the right ass) and appearing to be a “doer” when you think you already are just to name a few. Salary increases are not significant (1-3% every 18mths) unless you change jobs and negotiate your pay in a stellar way. GE summarizes the qualities of a great leader into what they call the “4 Es”. Energy, Energize, Execution and Edge. In theory they look great but in practice they are a disaster. Most of the managers think that practicing Energy/Energize is intimidating the teams to do what needs to get done.

Too many projects, too few people, constant battling for resources all compound some of the frustrations one faces working at a company like this.

Also, there are many opportunities to try out different roles at different businesses within GE, not just movement within your own business unit.","For my particular business unit, senior management does not seem connected to employees or engaged at all in the everyday challenges the business is facing. There does not seem to be clear direction from senior management on strategic or tactical issues, nor does there appear to be any clear understanding of our competition. While they may have the vision, they are not communicating that vision with employees.

For example, GE is a primary sponsor of Hands On Greenville and employee participation usually is on the order of several hundred employees. Lastly, Greenville is great location, it is not too large but large enough to bring in diverse performances and cultural events.","The average work week at GE is greater then 40 hours. ""Casual"" overtime is often expected and usually puts people work week between 50 to 60 hours. For regular employees GE has an extremely poor compensation plan. Top performers get ~5% raises on ~16 month interval. The majority of employees get 2 to 4% raises on a cycle greater then 16 months. Flexible Work Arrangements are not a ""true"" option. There is way too much opportunity for losses in productivity due to the informal ""casual"" overtime policy. Manufacturing engineering and design engineering have a poor relationship, so much so that manufacturing will not share office space with design. This causes a lack of space for the design employees, so often times six people are squeezed into a four cube area. Attrition seems to be getting worse and the quality of new employees is not as good as in the past. I believe lack of talent is driven by a desire to rapidly grow so a strategy of quantity over quality was employed. The attrition and lack of talent causes additional problems, employees usually split time trying to train the new people but often see the good ones leave in a year or two, while the ones lacking skill stick around taking a long time getting up to speed. Over the past couple of years GE has started reducing benefits for regular workers. Two good examples of this are a 20% increase in heath insurance and 33% increase in medical copays.

For example, if you were in one of the 'program' jobs, such as IMLP or FMP, there's a cadre of people who have completed the same program that gives a benchmark for your performance. It's like attending an Ivy League school vs. State U. ... Ivy League is known everywhere, but State U. is less well-known except in the geographic region. If you want to see the world, Join GE. The old adage about moving around has really been replaced; there's more emphasis on learning & mastering the job now, instead of learning every job in the company by relocation/reassigning you every 12-18 months. That's a huge improvement.","Given the flat organization structure, you can be a the same level for many years. You'll get pay increases, but not necessarily a title change. Their performance review process is too rigorous - there's just no getting around the ""bottom 5%"" situation with them. If you're graded as ""least effective"", you should get back in the job market, fast. You're expected to stay in a role for 18-24 months, and that is rigorously enforced. Even if you're the best candidate for an opening, if you haven't hit that milestone, you can forget about changing jobs. (Caveat - unless you're considered"" Top Talent"" in the annual Performance Management derby). Annual reviews are done, and a huge amount of time goes into this - almost bringing other work to a halt. However, your pay increases aren't necessarily annual - for Top Talent, it is 12 months, if you're considered ""Highly Valued"" - the middle 85% or so of employees, it is between 15-20 months. If you're ""Least Effective"" there is no raise. GE provides great benefits, but the tradeoff is that you will work very, very hard and very long hours.

3534,"""GE - Some good, some bad; It is very tough to make a generalized review with ""localized"" data.""",3.0,"The name says it alone - having GE on your resume (I think) gives credence to your career capabilities and career attributes to date. I worked for small companies prior to my time with GE and I feel that the GE name on my resume gives more weight to my credentials than if I only had small company experience on there. GE is internationally recognized and will definitely garner you respect if you have it on your resume. If you are lucky enough to get into one - the leadership training programs hold some weight on your resume as well. This would also include things such as green belt (six sigma training), various leadership classes, and general GE inclusiveness across their business units while being geographically disperse. So you might get a lot of experience handling multi-national teams (which is great experience in todays world), and you might get the experience of traveling to those locations. GE paid for 75% of my masters degree, and I was very pleased with the 100% tuition reimbursement program they offer. In only working here for a few years, I have seen a number of people move about within GE, across businesses. This is not to say that people didn't get promoted within my own business, but the GE touch across varioius business units seems to be working well - if you want to move somewhere and there is a job opening, the way is pretty much open to you. You can manage your career very actively, and apply to varioius job openings both within, and outside of your division - and there is no heartache if you leave for a different opportunity. After all, it is all GE.","GE is a behemouth. I work for a small division of a larger division, that itself is packaged into an even larger division. It is very tough sometimes to understand this corporate vision, see it and hear it and then apply it to your day to day job. And then you see press releases come out about your company that you were not aware of. It is the nature of a large company that is so fragmented across so many markets - it is a virtue of the company you work for, and good or bad you will see it as an employee. A lot of GE leadership is fraternal - you have to have been a part of their corporate audit staff, leadership development programs, or have gone to a highly ranked business school. Advancement outisde of those ranks is possible, but much tougher, and the higher you get, the more this will become apparent. I thought communication throughout the leadership ranks was not that great. There was little to no transparency (even though it was preached) and the workers doing the work were the last to know about very important company developments. This might be attributed to the staff that is working within my group - but I have heard stories about this occuring else where. GE is all about resources and scarcity. If in 2005, you can do a job with 5 people, by 2010, you will only have 1 person to do the job and they will most likely have 15 other jobs attributed to them by the lack of resources. Employees are expected to effectively manage this seeming impossibility, day in and day out. I think this would wear someone out over an entire career - I personally do not plan on staying here much longer than 5-7 years. Already, I work 9+ hour days and am expected to check my mail on weekends. This might again be a localized occurence for just me and my business, but I think it is a repetitive theme throughout GE. I am all about working better and smarter, but at some point there are just not enough hours in the day to do what is put on your plate.",General Electric

Basically each employee is required to do an internal resume of their qualifications, experience, accomplishments for the year, and your perceived strengths and weaknesses. Then the EMS is reviewed by your manager and your manager's manager. Your manager then does a counter-point to your listed accomplishments (or if you're well aware of your strengths and faults your manager will just agree with you), then you sit down privately with your manager to discuss views. It really give the employee a chance to trumpet themselves to management, but it is really tough when you're fairly humble. Regular raises, about every 18 month for most employees, every 12 months for the ""Top Talent"" in the company. Great Benefits, the usual health, dental, vision, 401k, and vacation, plus discount programs for company products (what does GE not make, honestly) and partners. Vast internal job opportunities, with so many divisions and locations in GE, there is a lot of potential places to go within the company. Ambitious growth of the company, that so far has been sustained for a few years now. Sustained double-digit revenue growth year over year is phenomenal for any company. Recent addition of CTO position over Engineering. Having an Engineer administrating the technical aspects of the company is the right thing to do. Having an advocate for the technical people in the company is a great thing. Too bad this is a recent development. At least in the groups I've worked in, my managers have been very flexible with work hours and time off. Strong emphasis on Integrity, making sure things are done above-board. It's nice getting instant, positive recognition from people when you say who you work for.","Re-org of the month club. The upper management of the company can't seem to make up their mind about how the company structure should look. In the time I've worked at GE there has been a re-org on average twice a year. GE is one of the world's oldest companies, and one of the 5 largest, yet for some reason no one seems to agree on how we should look, internally or externally. ""Roof-top consolidation"" and Outsourcing. I'm not sure what the problem is with having lots of small facilities, but management hates it like the plague, so they keep cutting facilities. They seem to either consider people to be disposable, or somehow expect their whole workforce to be so loyal that they'll move anywhere from 50 to 2000 miles to keep their jobs. Or they instead will just remove the facility entirely and move it to where labor is cheap, not seeming to care how long it will take to recoup the investment to move the manufacturing, nor the loss of good-will and respect with their customers and employees. Lean workforce and getting leaner. Every time I think we're a skeleton crew, they find more flesh to remove. Whether through attrition or layoffs, each time people go, they're not replaced, but somehow we're supposed to get just as much done. Far more outside managers hired than people promoted within. This is actually double-edged, because sometimes outside people are needed to break the status quo, but we need to be weeding out the incompetence, not bringing in fresh supplies of it. We at least get regular raises, which is better than some companies, but with the 18 month frequency for most employees, the raises don't keep up with inflation. The only way to get a real pay raise is to change jobs. Minimal upward mobility.

GE was unable, for me, to translate its values into actions in my small part of its enormous business. For me integrity means honesty 1st and foremost. It means other things to other people, and I had great difficulty seeing certain behaviours as having integrity without better insights being shared or communicated. GE is focused on the numbers first and foremost, and are very tactical within short time horizons. As yet they seem to lack the true strategic and visionary DNA needed for it to be a star in the software industry. This has far reaching impacts into a small vulnerable country where our future is always uncertain, and we need a long game to survive. Software customers also need a long game, as they invest heavily and become shackled to their suppliers.

All personal development I done was from my own pocket and holiday time. Current staff who stay, have been long term additions to the company with many typically straight from university, some 10-15 years ago. They have become very very arrogant to such an extent that new staff that come in with ideas and improvements from other companies and universities, are seen as a threat and ridiculed in front of peers, specially true for new staff with higher education. I worked typically 52 - 74 hrs a week on tasks that are always deadlines and need to be done, with no support from peers. People were leaving (no surprise there) and not being replaced, forcing staff to take up the slack. I guess it’s an ideal situation for higher managers to look good, do the same work with less staff. Just threaten people and crack the whip, sorry it’s not the 1800’s and no one deserves to be treated like that. You need to be in with the crowd to be noticed, certain people are with the ""in"" crowd, others are spoken to like an idiot. Raise staff bullying and your low salary to site HR rep and you are burned at your yearly review. You're highlighted as a trouble maker and told your ""career in GE is over"" and that ""they wouldn't mind seeing you go"". Even when you take that on the chin and stay with the company they take disciplinary action against you with some made up evidence to get you out the door, but it's your word against theirs. ""It’s your year to be thrown under the bus"" was the term I was told. When you try to appeal your told inaccurate HR policy and told no grounds to appeal against a rating that you've been given.

It's like a cancer that is spreading. -No use of 360 review system...it exists but not used. -Way too much turnover of positions...people move up before they are ready or laterally into a position they shouldn't be in because they never performed it themselves. -Most managers have never held the same role as their direct reports....how can you lead people if you have not done the job yourself? GE hires many veterans. In the military, a leader must know how to do the job above them and below them. Not at GE. I've seen many ex miltary leave GE, frustrated, after a short while because the style and structure of management is so upside down. -Internal evaluation system is abused by HR. Some have described as fuzzy. I would equate it with quicksand. No matter what you do positive only negativity prevails....and it's used as leverage against your salary action or rating (rack and stack). HR requires managers to post two things you must improve upon every year.. Anything can be written by a manager and once it's in the system it is there for perpetuity even if comments are completely wrong and you post a rebuttal with your side of the story. Only the ""negative"" comments carry on into view of future hiring managers....the rebuttal comments by the employee do not. An employee's only recourse is to never acknowledge (checking a box) that you held a discussion with your manager. Checking that box says you agree with whatever they wrote in their assessment. Well, there is the option of hiring outside legal counsel to correct this but that is HIGHLY discouraged...in fact there is an agreement you acknowledge (a check box on a website basically) that says you cannot hire legal counsel for employment disputes...you have to use one of HR's Ombudsmen (an HR manager from some other dept)....they'll basically rule for HR and not for you just about 100% of the time.

Big name. - Pension - Flexibility: working from home is ok,"- Cheap: One striking thing I noticed very soon after joining the company is that the culture here promotes being CHEAP. There is a difference between frugal and cheap, GE is Cheap. - Benefits: No bonuses, no stock options, no employee ESPP. Just your salary. - Fat: It feels as if there are too many people doing the same thing. During my interview process several months ago, so many people contacted me for the same thing, I thought that was odd but it stops there. However after I joined and a few months in now, I see the same thing. There is a lot of overlap in certain areas, too many chefs cooking the same meal, and not enough communication which is annoying. - Age: This is big. The majority of folks in our department are in their 40's and 50's. There don't seem to be a balance at all. Older folks have more experience and wisdom and are absolutely great to have around, they are strong pillars, however with age people grow to be more conservative and less of risk takers and not as fresh on creativity which tends to make things slow and shackled. There needs to be a balance in age otherwise we risk losing our edge. - IT: IT is really backwards. Network is slow and problematic, software/systems/processes are way too complicated to do anything. Some local networks are a mess. My desk phone is from the early 90's. My computer is old and slow and runs 10,000 services. - Complexity: Too much crippling bureaucracy. - Speed: things are VERY slow here. Takes forever to do anything. - Fragmentation: Teams seem to be fragmented all over the place, in different states, and cities. The lack of physical presence leads to a lack of communication and lack of effectiveness. Being available on chat is not enough. People need to be physically present to connect and establish contact and rapport. You can't build relationships over the phone or chat. - Communication: I don't feel that team members communicate effectively and enough around.",General Electric

6045,"""regarding software division of GE""",1.0,"Well, the outside view of GE is quite well known to most people. Everyone knows that GE was developed by inventor Thomas Edison, and was the first organization to manufacture the light bulb, and so on blah, blah, blah. However, what a prospective employee will want to know is the inside view of GE, i.e., what it is like to work in the organisation. As a current employee of GE, I hope to provide you with this insight. In the first paragraph, I will describe the outside view of GE, for those of you few people who are hearing about GE for the first time, so that you can get a general picture of the organization you are looking at. Then in subsequent paragraphs, I will give you the insider's view of GE, based on my own experiences, experiences of friends and colleagues, and the corporate grapevine. The General Electric Company, or GE, is an American multinational conglomerate corporation incorporated in the State of New York. In 2010, Forbes magazine had ranked GE as the world's second largest company, based on some kind of formula that compared the total sales, profits, assets, and market value of several multinational companies. GE has 304,000 employees around the world and is definitely is one of the most giant companies in the world and a force to be reckoned with. Okay, now here is the viewpoint from the employee's point of view. The good things are the flexible work timings, weekends off, subsidized food, free evening snacks, 20 days available leave (including sick leave), and availability of some good technical talent. Since everybody who has purchased a light bulb has heard about GE, it is also something which will be noticed on your resume. Also it follows six sigma quality standards and so you will be exposed to the most stringent quality practices. Reasonable good training is offered (of course your manager has to be proactive about recommending you for it) on both technical and quality issues. Good exposure to practices in a giant engineering company. Okay, though I am running out of time, I know that prospective employees will also want to know what are the cons, so I will give a brief description of that as well in the next section.","Well, I am really running out of time, but I will definitely not abandon the reader and will touch upon the main important points which a prospective employee will have to keep in mind and be alert about. I have observed a poor quality of the HR and the middle level managers as compared to the presence of some good technical talent, as a consequence there is not much respect for the technical talent, which has resulted in the technical talent being treated more as labour, rather than as talent. If you are a technical talent, you will have to conciliate with some of the arrogant and negligent behavior of HR and middle level managers, the only other alternative being to leave the organization. I have observed over the past year a very sizable attrition of the best technical 'icons' in the organization. Though the reasons why people leave the organization is never publicized and not known except to a few close friends, there is also a very good indication of some hire and fire practices being in place, it is quite well known from the grapevine that a sizable percentage of people leave the organization on performance grounds, apart from these, people can also be asked to leave based on suspicion of their commitment to the company(i.e., suspicion that they are looking for other jobs), people can also be asked to leave if it is believed that they are too well qualified and hence difficult to retain, hence not likely to become a long term asset. As a result of these factors, I would say that overall the job security is not very secure in this organization, especially when you compare it with other Indian organizations. Well, these are the things you have to look out for, if you are trying to decide on joining or are considering joining the organization. Well, I hope that I have been of help in this article, and I do hope that you are able to weigh the pros and cons and make a good decision. Good Luck!",General Electric

6167,"""GE""",4.0,GE gives you the opportunity to fulfill all your career goals and recognises and rewards hard work. There is a wealth of on-line resources to help you do your job but not alot of on the job training. The organisation is constantly changing and you have to be flexible - this is something I enjoy as there are always challenges.,There is no work/life balance this is a message that is fed from the top. Deadlines are extremely tight and have to be met often resulting in 50 plus hour weeks and weekend work. The organisation is very short termist and it is often hard to see the longer term strategy. Compensation packages tend to be at market rate on entry but fail to keep pace with competitors after a couple of years in the job.,General Electric
6168,"""Depends on what you are looking for""",4.0,"Endless opportunities, strong brand, leadership training",Unique culture that may be difficult for outsiders to assimilate into,General Electric
6169,"""Working in 21st century GE""",4.0,"It encourages the talent inside me to grow and let me share my thoughts to improve or review the job process. Helps me to be resourceful. This means that I'm equipped well and in an effective way in order to find and manage resources on my own to facilitate the execution of job or project in the best optimal way which would be a win-win situation for both company and the customer. The employees are neutral and friendly. There is no politics and leg-pulling culture. One would feel completely independant to execute his job. Of course, a great company with a clear vision and goals and objectives.","The finance and HR sections are a bit nuisance sometimes. The company expects its employees to devote time beyond the working normal hours so that the execution of the jobs or the projects could be carried out in the best way possible. There is a very much work load. Sometimes, it is left upon you to balane the life between job and the family. This makes the task a bit more difficult and stressful. One shocking aspect is that one is expected to initiate the process of visas and related stuff on one's own since the company does not take much responsibility in this regard.",General Electric

6171,"""Review of GE sales job""",3.0,Fortune magazine named GE the number one company for developing leaders.,The company is undergoing huge changes right now. Many employees including myself feel left in limbo.,General Electric
6172,"""Dissappointed""",1.0,"Pretty relaxed atmosphere. Unlimited sick time, and nice cubicles. Pride of working for a major multinational corporation with a great reputation. Fairly relaxed atmosphere and no dress code. Business class air travel when on overseas business. Free cookies and treats at various places throughout the building. Free parking.","Operation is falling apart, the result of a lack of product development and declining sales. Limited training opportunities. Management won't match oil and gas salaries and professionals are leaving for oil and gas firms. Old technology and no clear plan to update the product line. No 'excitement' of working for a growing company, and hence, limited opportunities for advancement.",General Electric
6173,"""Go Green""",4.0,Freedom and power. Very big.,"Culture is cut throat until people are there for 5 years - then they get lazy, but do make good permanat b players.",General Electric
6174,"""ge""",4.0,intra-company opportuties for advancement and growth,financial services exposure has hurt over the last few years,General Electric
6175,"""Great for job satisfaction and career oportunitities, but Immelt is screwing up.""",4.0,"My role gives me a lot of satisfaction. Allowed to focus on the important few priorities without been rated negatively when the others are neglected. Being a multinational there are great opportunities to relocate around the world and the top performers are not discouraged from doing so. Even though you are worked hard, there is generally an air of positivity and good nature within the teams.",A lot of uncertainty and lack of job security within some of the business units given Immelt's portfolio management work. Seemingly every week something is sold or trying to be sold. Lack of appetite for giving managers enough people to get stuff done means you are worked hard. Work/Life balance is heavily favored towards work.,General Electric
6176,"""Big globally, small locally!""",3.0,"It's very good for your career, to gain some inside prespective of what are the inercias of one of the biggest companies in the world. Lots of contacts inside and outside the company, all over the world.",Big company but very difficult to move among business units in order to evolve. No HR support regarding a career plan. The company don't trust in their workers.,General Electric
6177,"""GE needs a revamp""",2.0,"Many opportunities to join different organizations, and connections inter-company can be easily established.","No practical recognition of achievements, only lip service",General Electric
6178,"""Overall one of the most rewarding places to be.""",4.0,GE only has the best people working. Being with the best means being around people who have the same drive and motivation to succeed. Volunteerism is everywhere and makes work more enjoyable and rewarding to be with GE.,"Not enough full time w/benefits positions for everyone, not enough little perks.",General Electric
6179,"""My time in the isolated GE village""",1.0,"facilities in Melbourne - for working away from the CBD everything you needed was provided. (Gym, Food, Childcare, Parking, Close to transport) - The first of my 3 managers was fantastic.","Being isolated in a GE type village, Staff where not treated equally - more about who you knew than what, the music being piped on to our level was more irritating and distracting, very demotivating environment, the managers in my division had no understanding of people management - surely when the turnover is as high as it was in our small division thats an indication something is wrong?",General Electric
6180,"""You should not spend your whole career here""",2.0,"GE has a very good market reputation, they do offer promotions to eligible employees. An employee can easily move accross functions and locations.","They dont pay very well, leaders seems lazy in their work and are less aggresive in their approach.",General Electric
6181,"""Not the best company to work for""",1.0,"Good job if you are right out of school. They will give you the basics that you can use to find another job. It's managements fault, they will not try to keep you after they train you.","bad management. bad pay. No growth oppurtunities. This location is run by incompetent management. They make promises and do not keep them. You get a raise every year and a half which is 3-5%. They seem to change their whole set of employees every 6-12 months because everyone is pissed. So again, only take this job if you are really desparate or this is your first job out of school. Please consider moving on after 6 months.",General Electric
