The room for advancement within the company has become very difficult within the last year. Bonuses were once a year, and very minimal for associates.

The job itself requires you to meet certain goals that are tough as is, however, if you stay late and work hard and get the work done they see that you can handle what is being given so they attempt to give you extra that others cannot complete.

I was deployed for about 10 months of that time frame. Upon coming home from my deployment, I had resigned since I found a new job. I was then sent a bill in the mail saying I owed about $3400 to Nationwide, due to hours that were not able to process in their system, that they ""paid"" me for. I went through a 2 month period of going back and forth with them, trying to explain that if I was over paid that amount of money, I would have realized it. I ended up settling the issue with them (right around the Christmas holidays), and owed them around $450 for money that was over paid to me. The entire issue was that when I was on drill weekends, even though I would request to not be paid from the company while I was not there, they still continued to pay me. I did not realize the entire time that I worked there. The company ran an audit back in March (while I was deployed) and found the issue, but did not mention it to me at all until I came home. So a great holiday season to me, when I have an unexpected bill of $500. I understand that if you overpaid me, that I have to pay it back. But the fact that they even over paid me in the first place, and then didn't mention it to me until 7 months later. If you are in the military and drill, be careful of how you input your time into their system, or you may receive a hefty bill from them down the road. Overall, the company/people/benefits were great, and I enjoyed my time working there, but I felt betrayed by the company for how they handled my situation.",Nationwide

But when I started it seemed like one of those dream companies where they recognize hard work and everyone is engaged in the work they do. And they tell you this in the interview, on the walls where they post their values and just about every company email but the ones that stick around know the truth. The best advice I can give is get the experience you need, get your degree on them and leave for greener pastures before the smell of the poo rises to high. The only way to move up in the company is to be a brown nose or be related to a person that gives you a recommendation. Other wise your experience and work ethic get you no where.",Nationwide

They also really help you develop and will help you get into other areas of development you are interested. If you wanted to go from being a cobol developer to a java developer they will help you make that transition. Pay is right around what other companies pay from what I have seen. The best thing about the company is work life balance and flexibility. Having kids requires you to work from home sometimes when they are sick and they allow you to do that and the hours are flexible too as long as your 8 hour day falls in the core hours of 9-3. So you can work 7-3 or 9-5 and you can shift that when ever you need to. So having a family that is the best benefit to me. Also we do Agile development so we commit to work we can complete in a 2 week period so there is not overtime or stress about working more than your 8 hours.,Not much web or mobile development in Des Moines.

Some supervisors have favorites and are willing to help people move up who are on finals and shouldn’t be moving up. Systems are constantly breaking you will spend the majority of your shift trying to troubleshoot your system and if your system breaks in the middle of a call and quality can see you are having system issues then don’t expect for them to work with you or help you out because of your system issues.

Everything is numbers driven, so you have to explain why you have had a less productive day. Micro-managing in its definition. No growth opportunities (obviously) and they struggle to retain talent. The last 3 positions I took were lateral, meaning no raise. Pay is far below industry average so top talent goes elsewhere. They try to make up for the lacking pay in “culture”...but you can’t feed your family with culture. I worked for NW for almost a decade and saw a very, very low moral and apathy from leadership in the past few years. No real direction...very reactive to the market instead of proactive. There is a reason they grew so fast...they wrote pretty much everything for years, and now dealing with the consequences of that in terms of loss ratios. If you are reading this and currently with NW, do yourself a favor and check out other companies. I easily found a position offering 30% more pay with about half of the workload.

Multiple reorganizations over the more than decade I’ve been there. Lack of transparency from leadership, although they promise it, it’s not delivered. You can expect to be silo’d with zero cross department training. And also expect to pigeonholed. Some leaders are great, others are not. Some leaders actually manadate no performance ratings over a certain level for the entire department. No consistency between departments. As for their ‘Greatest Places to Work’ award - not every employee participates or even receives the poll. Top leadership is in such a hurry to have a ‘plan’ they don’t bother the think through the intended and unintended consequences, so a few months down the road, they’ll change their minds and off they’ll go in another direction . Constance upheavals in process. Because the company is so severely silo’d - multiple versions of the same operations/systems- wasted money that they attempt to remedy through layoffs of experienced personnel. Don’t expect that your high performance will save you from a lay-off - if your job code is selected, you’ll just be gone, performance doesn’t matter. Nor will decades with the company. And while they will give lip service to trying to place you in a new position- that’s all it is. They need to change their slogan because they can hardly offer “On your side” service by slashing as much experience as they have over the last few years. Benefits: bare minimum. In spite of being self insured for many of the products, including health insurance- high prices and high deductibles. And a paternalistic attitude including health screenings that while not mandatory, if you don’t participate, you’ll be paying even more for your health insurance. Because of the understaffing, work hours are often long and carry over to the weekends. Expect to figure out your own solutions as training is spotty and leadership very well may not have the experience to guide you.",Nationwide

I find myself in Sacramento and re-hired by Nationwide. Good experience. Actually, better in Sacramento. Good caring people. Stayed for about three years when I found a better opportunity. At that time underwriters were no longer assigned to individual agents - hence no real relationship building.

Recent announcements are resulting in several layoffs in commercial and PL underwriting, claims, risk control and product. In a booming economy this is a troubling concern while other carriers are looking for talent, NW is laying them off. The organization is too top heavy with too many people with random VP titles.

Despite boasting to “Work as one Nationwide” the departments have almost no interaction/communication with one another leading to so much confusion for internal employees and customers. Male leaders sexist towards women in terms of bonuses/raises, daily standards, and behaviors in general. Layoffs are the new norm and even if you’re not currently at risk of a layoff supervisors constantly bring up possibilities if you don’t perform above goals. Leaders make threats to withhold bonuses and raises and threaten to demote if you decline to take on advancement roles. Unable to request time off unless more than a month in advance. Outdated/very strict occurrence policy. 1/2 an occurrence for being more than 5 mins late, that’s insane. Attendance policy also encourages you to lie to supervisor. If your child/family is sick you get 1 occurrence per day you’re out. If your sick you get 1 occurrence for up to 5 days you’re out. My supervisor even told me to give him no details in the future or he’d be forced to give me multiple occurrences for telling the truth when I missed 2 days due to a sick child.

This results in refusal to staff properly and adjuster workloads run 80% higher than target. Upper leadership responds by offering comments such as ""change isn't for everybody."" There are annual layoffs. The organization is constantly in flux which keeps everyone on edge. There is always a plan and the plan is always changing which makes it difficult to trust that anyone really has a vision for what the company wants to be. NW purchased Harleysville insurance several years ago which is a complete disaster. The systems won't integrate, most of the business has been run off, agency relationships suffer because Nationwide doesn't know how to compete with other insurers who write the same business. This leads to agents not wanting to write business with us so premium is shrinking and the insurance operation lost $400M last year. People are so detached from results that upon hearing the amount of lost revenue they are still wandering around asking how much their bonus will be. It may have been a good place to work at one time. People who have been here for 20+ years say it was. And now they're stuck here with nowhere to go and it is no longer a good place to work. Corporate values are not tied to leadership's behaviors in any way, shape or form. Attitudes toward front line workers are as ruthless as I have ever witnessed in any organization. Benefits are incredibly expensive. They cost $450/month for a family and come with a $6000 per person/$10,000 per family deductible. There is no opportunity for advancement since positions are simply eliminated if someone leaves. There are plenty of good infrastructure and people here is someone decides they actually want this to be an insurance company.

There was not a single person left from the old group. The new team had no strategy or direction. Of course, they eventually failed. So what happened McKinsey came from outside and partnered with IT just to deploy Lean within NW and asked for a blank check.

750,"""Started out great, ended being the worst job I ever had.""",1.0,"There are genuine people in the company that really do care about their customers and what they are doing. The ‘core’ of the company which is helping other people is honest and sincere. I have been in elevators with multiple CEOs taking about how even though they had to pay out for storm damage that is what they were there for. Great flextime. Come in when you want as long as the work gets done. Need to make up hours, just do so on the weekend. Sick family member, just go take care of them don't worry about it. You can work with really amazing people and make great friends. Facilities are top-notch for a downtown building(s) (minus Agile spaces.) If they do decide to laid you off they give a generous severance and time to find a new job.","When I started five years ago I was the ‘rock-star’ on the team. I transferred to a new team and everything fell apart after that. You have way too many individuals in managing positions who do not understand the work that their subordinates do, or that are not properly equipped for the task given to them. I have seen several times groups thrown into specific roles with little or no training to maintain the responsibilities given to them. Lean processes are used to remove individuals who speak up against being treated poorly. Don’t like that we remove your wastebaskets, we just ‘lean’ you out. Don't like the standing desks and 'standing' well you're too close minded so we'll just reorg your department without you in it. New buildings are all crowded little cubicles with no walls and no privacy. You have no privacy, none! People will be screaming and laughing loudly when you’re trying to get work done. When you complain managers will tell you to find a meeting room or put on headphones instead of correcting the bad behavior. Too much trying to be like Facebook/Google in the IT space without consideration for those with disabilities. The IT agile methodology does not work and is the downfall of creativity in American society. The constant so-called modernization of the modern office does nothing more to delight the millennial to believe they are being paid more than they actually are, and isolate everyone from Generation X up. No one who actually wants to accomplish something at work enjoys these environments. Most of the day is the younger group standing around getting nothing done while the adults actually are trying to work and getting headaches. Nationwide does nothing to correct or remove employees who have inappropriate or bad behaviors. Someone is allowed to be a complete jerk to you and their supervisors will even support them. Marketing and IT will literally fight over processes to remove employees they don't like. If you don't play the nice game and 'suck-it-up' Nationwide will not be on your side. Office of Associate relations and HR are completely incapable to take care of and assist employees. I attempted numerous times to find a new role within Nationwide and all I received was automated responses. When I finally did receive feedback, it was another case of a manager not knowing the technology or the business need. Nationwide’s Health Benefits plan are extremely disappointing. You are forced to give up your vitals otherwise they will deduct money from your paycheck. Too much process in the wrong areas and not enough trust for qualified employees to do their job, and then over-compensating for employees or are inadequate. A lot of unqualified people get promoted because they can 'walk the walk, talk the talk.' Don’t have a standard family (wife and kids) or belong to a minority group (woman,gay etc..) you won’t fit in. Single people over 40 are also in the firing range for being fired. As typical with most businesses they hire a lot of contractors from external countries who do not know what they're doing. They stay for a while make money to send back to their parents and then leave at the critical time of the project. A lot of talk of transparency and speaking up, but when you actually do you get criticized.",Nationwide

Most employees seem happy or at least content with their jobs. Volume of work depends on your department. The office I work in is very friendly and social. Lots of baby showers, happy hour after work, etc...which is nice. Upper management in my office is very approachable; a genuine interest is taken in the employee. Upper management is actually sincere and not the ""fake"" nice that can occur just because they have to make nice with the huddled masses from time to time just to keep up appearances. When you do your job well, show up for work as required and have no ""issues"", things will be just fine. Internal job opportunities/transfers are pretty plentiful if you want to move across disciplines or move up in the company.","Depending on your job, staffing in your department & whether or not you're salaried or not, you could technically work less than 40 hours per week or you could work 60+. Benefits such as health insurance have declined over the years. Company has a ""wellness program"" and if you don't participate you're essentially penalized by paying a surcharge on your health insurance contribution; in addition, you have to meet certain health related goals such as BMI. Performance evaluations always seem to land at a ""3"" (scale of 1-5, with 5 being the best) for nearly all employees; regardless of how well (or how poorly) the employee performs. My personal opinion is that your performance evaluation is somewhat of a popularity contest. I have had extremely high, glowing evaluations from one manager/region. However, I've been transferred to work under a different manager for one reason or the other, doing the exact same job, performing at the same high level yet I will receive an average (""3"") rating. This is not just isolated to me as I have confirmed with others who have faced the exact same issue. It seems illogical that a high performer would suddenly become just average for no apparent reason. I have seen high performers under one manager go to being fired once his/her direct manager changed. Promotions have taken a turn for the worse. You will sometimes see qualified individuals promoted to let's say manager. On the other hand, individuals gets promotions and it leaves us all dumbfounded how someone with no technical skills and no people skills rises to the next level. Perhaps it is the ""Peter Principle"" in action. Unfortunately, I find all insurance companies to be financially driven (which makes sense) and really every employee is disposable in the end. Like most other insurance companies, Nationwide is a good place to work when everything is good including your health. However, if you become seriously ill/injured, look out. Everything is ERISA so the employee essentially has few rights and little to no recourse. Corporate (those downtown in The Towers) don't know you, don't care to know you and if you're a liability...the balance sheet must be adjusted. Things are made as difficult and cumbersome as possible. To corporate, you (the employee) are just a drain on resources and a financial liability to be reckoned with.",Nationwide

In the area where I worked, office politics was almost non-existent and managers were straight-forward. There were no surprises in the semi-annual performance reviews, however, getting a GREAT review is nearly impossible according to the rubric they use (think ""able to leap tall buildings in a single bound""); so an average performance review at Nationwide is fantastic anywhere else. Lots of opportunities to advance and move around the company. When they laid off anyone in our area (which is to say, I don't know if this is company-wide behavior), they told us that we would be receiving our 60-day notice about 30 days in advance. Once we got our 60-day notice, our job was to find a new job. Still had all of the benefits during that time. Severance pay was one week per year of service. Decent pension, if you work there long enough.","Nationwide's I.T. strategy is to move software development off-shore as much as is possible. For those positions which cannot be moved to off-shore, they bring Indians over here to be the interface for the devs back home. Nationwide's partner in crime is Infosys. As we trained our incompetent replacements, we saw all of our hard work flushed down the toilet when they decided to hard-code *everything* instead of using our table-driven ""code"". Our manager was disgusted, her manager (and, probably, upstream managers) saw only dollar signs.

1450,"""Stability... Always Most Valued in Hindsight""",4.0,"I got my post-college start at a subsidiary of Nationwide and then spent years working directly for the company. Nearly four and a half years after leaving, I have the perspective to appreciate how lucky I was. The company treated me very fairly, and its culture was patient, meritocratic and supportive. I was always adequately or well compensated, and there was plenty of opportunity. I was always given training and support to accomplish my work. I have grown to appreciate this access much more after working for other companies that are less generous with these essentials. Nationwide was also a relatively stable environment. Although there was significant change and reorganization during my time there, employees were seldom laid off when a job classification obsoleted. In fact, most that I knew were given months of advance warning that their position was being eliminated, and encouraged to apply for other positions internally. This was consistent with Nationwide's general culture of developing talent within the company and encouraging lateral job moves as part of career paths. Again, I have come to appreciate this tendency far more after realizing how rare that approach is. Stories of the executives who started in entry-level positions and gained expertise over time were common knowledge, sometimes celebrated by the subject of the stories themselves. Management culture was generally forthright and friendly, and willing to coach employees for performance improvement rather than simply terminate them. As a new employee I made plenty of mistakes, including misunderstanding office etiquette, and am continually grateful to the managers and mentors who took the time to teach me. Overall, I found Nationwide a very professional environment, and a great place to grow for those who are interested in an earnest, reliable organization.","Admittedly, property and casualty insurance is not the sexiest field. So those looking for excitement or hip coworkers may not be as happy with the culture. Nationwide has had plenty of organizational growing pains, especially in its IT area. Sometimes it was clear that executive level strategic vision was regarded as unrealistic by middle management, which led to mixed success or long delays for some initiatives. Employees in my area frequently felt disconnected from the strategic level considerations discussed at all company, or division wide meetings. Although this a fairly meritocratic organization, every company has politics. This is probably more of a concern for those hoping to get into upper management or executive jobs. It was not uncommon to see some of these leaders leave with obvious frustrations at leadership or their inability to effect change.",Nationwide

Large company thus implementing change is very difficult especially when leadership at different levels can't embrace (generally the long tenured ones) it or are too slow to. Too many CYA activities monopolize time. Work life balance for leadership becomes an issue the higher you go up. In a nut shell, uninformed decisions made by leaders who hide in their offices and then time spent by directors (sometime AVPs) reacting to those decisions and cleaning up the mess made. And if you don't effectively clean up and fix it, you will have performance issues yourself. Extreme break down in accountability and the worst of all anti-core values behavior by officers to whom you should be looking up to... not down on. There are many amazing leaders but the bad ones ruin it. So as you can imagine basic symptoms flair up: turnover, sick leave/stress leave, performance issues, lack of engagement, interdepartmental transfers, poor quality work outcomes, etc. The passing of the old guard will eventually take place but we have LOTS of damage to manage until then.

Nationwide's horribly slow network makes file maintenance and case management almost impossible, especially since the caseload is enormous. IT tries to be helpful but can only do so much when the system is not modern enough to handle the internet traffic into Ohio (Nationwide's headquarters). It is also confusing, user-unfriendly, and complex interface. The department was grossly understaffed and if someone was out sick or on vacation, we were expected to work on that person's caseload as well. The target productivity expectations are completely unattainable. I received literally hundreds of emails a day. In my opinion, I wasn't able to spend an ample amount of time on projects to double check my work. Updating the software system to input the case status took almost as much time as the project itself! Supervisors required us to file Motions to Compel for late discovery from plaintiffs despite the fact our own discovery was also overdue at the time. Overtime was completely prohibited. Employees were closely watched to make sure nobody clocked in/out a minute earlier or later than one's set time schedule, including lunch. There was no litigation support to help with copies, mail, or typical runner's duties. Paralegals do not go to trial with their attorneys. When I walked in my first day of work my desk was piled high with files and papers, the status of which nobody knew. I wish I had left then and there. We were required to attend numerous weekly phone conferences consuming valuable time that could be spent on our caseloads. While management asked for feedback and encouraged questions, staff was under the belief that any input was futile, therefore, questions or comments were generally suppressed. The phone conferences amounted to cheerleading sessions that were repetitive, redundant, and a colossol waste of time for those of us working in the legal department. They discussed company profits, etc. that may have been important to very upper management, marketing, or sales, but certainly not the legal department employees.

A bad performance review can diminish your opportunities for advancement. You oftentimes get notes from management that seem to be focused on perception rather than results or efficiency.

Meetings with upper leadership quickly devolve into un-constructive ""kiss-up"" sessions. This is fine for the most part: a large national carrier like Nationwide, Geico, States All- & Farm, etc. can make money hand over fist in direct sales while running on auto pilot as quantity beats quality. This breezy attitude, unfortunately, does not fly in the independent agent market that Nationwide is attempting to infiltrate (in part, by purchasing regional carriers- which is how I became a NW employee). All the witty TV commercials and treacly appeals to company values mean nothing to agents when service suffers due to closing offices and the resulting attrition of staff and talent. Additionally, going back to the ""Pro"" about compensation, if you have health problems, expect the ""great"" wages to be spent on out-of-pocket medical expenses as NW, probably like many companies now, only offer what is essentially the bare-minimal product that can legally be called ""health insurance"".",Nationwide

Additionally, given the balance between insurance and financial services, the company has a strong financial position. Gallup employee engagement scores are built into the compensation structure for management. This drives both desirable as well as undesirable behaviors.","If you do not like the idea of working in Columbus or Scottsdale or Des Moines, depending on the role you're interested in, Nationwide may not be the place for you. Culturally, many areas of the company are not very open to temporary or long term virtual work arrangements. Unlike former places I have worked, I get the vibe that many senior leaders at Nationwide are arrogant (at the SVP level and above). This is CERTAINLY not true of all leaders, but it is a vibe that I have consistently felt during my experience here. While Nationwide is moving in the right direction uniting as one organization, and while it claims to be member-focused, culturally Nationwide has a long ways to go before it can truly say it is customer-centric in every breath it breathes. Base compensation is strong. However, annual performance bonuses and raises are very small (bonuses for non-leadership level roles will generally be around 1.5-2.5% depending on company performance; raises even for great performers may be at max around 4%). Additionally, while Nationwide has a pension, it is not a multiplying pension.
