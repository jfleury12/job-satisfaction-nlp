Location is well...not good, and because of this, talented and bright individuals are a scarcity. Anyone who has those qualities has already left for other opportunities outside of the area.

Each person feels powerless to make real change given all the layers.

People in NJ might have a boss in NY or TN, who then has a boss in NJ, etc. I've never seen anything like it in my career. This all leads to virtually no business relationships being built and diffuses accountability. No camaraderie within department; morale is low depending on which office you are in. People brought over in acquisitions seem to just be hanging on until retirement, unenthused about anything. Processes are inefficient and highly rigid, leading to the strictest deadlines I've ever seen in my career (leading to work/life balance problems at times, as you will work Friday nights and weekends, when it doesn't have to be that way) and resulting in tasks being beneath what they should be for a given experience level. Extremely uninspiring work. Way too many layers of management and way too many meetings of various size circles that are completely unnecessary - there should be more small-team meetings with real purpose. Training/guidance is almost nonexistent, as everyone seems too busy to meet their workload to guide the various new people that have been brought on board.

Coupled with a less than ideal location (40 miles southeast of Raleigh), high potential talent choose to work for other companies in the RTP area instead.

Management only recently tried to implement a downtime tracking and inventory tracking system but don't know how to use either to drive down delays or order materials for the equipment.

We have what is call a Pfizercation, where colleagues are encouraged or required to attend telecoms or meeting even when they should be on holiday. One colleague was on a webex the day after an emergency appendectomy. Because it's a global company you are on call 24/7/365, it's not unheard of to have telecoms at 5AM or10PM several times a week.. In addition the constant restructuring and cost cutting leaves the employees who are left with the workload of 7 or 8 until the straw that breaks the camel's back is realized and then more attention is paid to workload. The matrix organization where one group pays for project, but another group has to provide the FTE holds up projects and ruins relationships with KOLs. there is constant adjusting of strategy for the sole reason of cutting costs, not what is best for the asset or patients. There is no 5 year plan, it's just want we can do today for the lowest cost. Bonuses are a farce as many employees had a 10 to 21% pay cut last year just to have to replaced with a bonus that may not equal or surpass what was cut.

Pfizer also is sensitive to life / work balance.,"Over the last several years, due to a failing and unpredictable pipeline, the company has become a lot more risk adverse and nervous.

Specifically, Pfizer is less likely to do research in diseases / conditions that will not guarantee a return of at least &gt;/= $1 billion annually. As a result, I found a lot of the research to be more ""reegineering"" established products than conducting innovative research. Additionally the culture has become a lot more competitive than collaborative; colleagues are more likely to try to take credit for work that they may have not done completely individually themselves.
