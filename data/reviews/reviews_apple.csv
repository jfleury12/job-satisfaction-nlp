After all the rah rah APPLE IS GREAT dies down it is a sales job. For the most part Apple products sell themselves. Most people tend to know what they want. They come to the store for the Apple experience. After that you're being judged on stuff like adding AppleCare+, Apple Business introductions and other metrics. Training feels rushed. 3 weeks of partial drilling of sales highlights. Too much to know for the incredibly complicated world of products, cell phone plans, AppleCare+ and Genius Bar. Basically they pound you full of the overview and you'll pick up the rest on the floor. Seasonal workers are exposed to the benefits and perks of the full time employees but can't participate. Feels bad. You get some of the benefits but not others and it is often not clear. Had more experienced staff snipe business referrals from customers I was working with. I had one interaction with my team leader in 4 months. Nice guy but felt very uninterested in our team growth. I'd be curious to see what the retention was per team related to the team leaders. Had coworkers tell me they avoided taking customers who appeared to be from abroad due to the likelihood that they wouldn't be able to attach AppleCare+ to a sale and drive down their numbers. Managers seem to be oblivious to that fact. Constant drumbeat for retail employees to care and give back to the community with employee donations and volunteering. Asking people making $25k a year to donate and volunteer for things felt weird. While they are all very earnest and good causes, they should be teaching financial planning seminars more often. The amount of coworkers spending their paychecks back into Apple was astounding.

It is not flexible at all and working with management to take time off can be frustrating.

416,Apple,"Where to start. You basically have to live and breathe it at every moment, on the clock or off. Forced overtime during releases or holidays. Passive aggressive management techniques designed to make you feel guilty for missing work. Revolving door of employees because of nearly unobtainable requirements set by management. Training had a lot of bumps in it, not because of the trainers, but the lack of material. I mentioned holidays before. You might as well forget seeing your family if you have to travel. No time off is allowed during the winter holidays. Zero, none, even if you have planned a year in advance. Overtime is often forced even during the weeks with holidays so you have even less time off for your families. When you express any concern over these practices the management takes you aside to remind you that only the customer is important and that you agreed to work any times the office was open. Speaking of time away from family, if you get assigned to a special project prepare to work 60+hours a week. Management becomes aggressive when you aren't performing to specific standards and this can sometimes lead to 20-25% turnover in a given month. In fact, less than 5% of my starting group lasted more than 90 days. Busy work is given almost daily, which interferes with work operations. Any new training is given via these ridiculous online courses or through a very brief summery in an online meeting (Webex). Worst of all, sometimes it is given out via email with little explanation of policy changes. Attendance is always an issue and with little wiggle room, no manner your tenure. I guess the best summary is they put product and capitol far above their employees worth, like most businesses, but without a real pretense of caring. Low pay, long hours just to have Apple on your resume probably isn't worth it since most companies of the caliber pay more with better incentives.

They are not there to guide you along your journey at Apple or the organization. Not all managers are people people. The rules are mean to be followed and not meant to be bend, even for the greater good. You will be among followers, not leaders. (Apple has succeeded because they break the rules and don't just follow.) You will be micromanaged on your work. This may be refuted by those in management, but its is accurate. The entire place is micromanaged ""up the wazoo"". The business always comes first. Always. ""Business needs"" are the reason for everything. Of course the business is important, but some seem to forget how the business needs actually get fulfilled and by whom. Compared to Apple retail, you are left to fend for yourself and be your own advocate - as no one else will be there for you. Retail also has many more team building and moral boosting functions then App Review. App review works and schedules based on shifts - and the options are few. When you are hired, you may be given an odd work week schedule. Even though this is an office job, don't expect to work Monday through Friday. Career advancements in the department are small.
