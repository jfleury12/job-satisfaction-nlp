First off who knows what customers and employees are breathing in while walking around in there. The vents in the ceiling are constantly dirty. The aisle with the cement products can have over 20 bags of cement broken at one time. Just the 200+ people walking up and down that aisle and carts rolling through and breathing in all that cement dust is disturbing. The customers can just be plain rude liars. For a lot of the women, the customers creeping them out, asking them out or for their number is quite common. The bad customers are cowards because they know most associates won’t do anything since many of the associates need their jobs. These customers are bullies and management just wants associates to brush it off. The scheduling is erratic. It’s done by an app but then I think someone is supposed to double check it. It’s just gotten worse and worse over the years. The gaps in coverage force people who actually are workers to have to work in multiple departments and run around like maniacs. Turnover is high, salary is low. Management basically hires anyone. In my opinion they don’t really care since they won’t be interacting with the ones they hire unless there is a discipline or scheduling problem. The majority of managers are lazy actors just playing the part for their marginal pay. They are yes-men who will never question corporate. I’ve been with the company 10+ years and I’ve never heard(other than a select few and only in private) them question anything from corporate. They constantly encourage cashiers to open up three credit cards per customer. Although they have some nice no interest offers, the cards like other retail cards are deferred interest and can seriously bury people in horrible retail debt. I can go on and on lol.

I gave them roughly 25 hours to work with when I was first hired and this rapidly turned into 39 exactly every week. (They did not want to pay overtime and wanted you to work up to the absolute max before it would kick in). *Not to sound cliche but I am a very hard worker. I made an effort to learn all the systems for every specialty department (Kitchens, Flooring, Millwork, Home Decor, Pro among others). I became the go-to whenever some form of equipment or machinery needed to be used, be it running the paint desk, saws, In-stock carpet, keys, etc. I learned to do this by myself without asking from a manager. This became one of the biggest issues with my time at the company. I would be constantly pulled from whatever I was tasked with to do something else. Come the end of the night I would be scolded for not completing the original task which there was no time left in the day to do. They took advantage of one of the few people that made the effort to grow and in turn beat me into the ground. There were many nights where the store was severely short-handed and I would be given the phones for three if not more departments. I was often the only person scheduled within most of specialty and had to take care of all of them. To prove a point they wound up installing all the specialty programs on one computer so I didn't have to run back and forth between departments. Typically I was closing shift and that created a whole bunch of other issues because of the aforementioned reasons. *The only bonus that I received after all of this was a $0.35 raise after being with the company for a year. I was started at $12.00 an hour. There were associated that were paid a lot more than I, who did a fraction of what I did. *While I was running around the store like a madman we had other associated that would sit on their butts all day and were never tasked with anything outside their assigned department. Because I was willing to work and showed that I was more than capable to do so, I was, in turn, worked into the ground while fellow associates didn't have to do anything. *I was given the same sales quotas as a full-time associate while being only part-time. Even though I met and exceeded those quotas on a consistent basis I was heavily scolded when I failed to meet one for a week. Other associates would not even be spoken to. *I wound up being fired after asking for a raise approx. a month earlier, for a ""safety violation"" of not using a safety knife to open a cardboard box. *Below is what my ""Disciplinary Notice"" stated: *(my name) was using a carpet knife to open boxes he was not wearing gloves or using an approved safety knife. ASM (ASM name) stopped him and had him get a safety knife and gloves. Based on the company's investigation, it has been determined that this conduct violated the company's safety policies. * Improvement Plan: * (my name) employment with Home Depot is terminated. *Upon my date of termination, I was worked hard once again and then was called into the office approx. 45 minutes before the end of my eight-hour shift and was let go. I was asked if I needed someone to escort me to the door after grabbing my stuff because they were afraid that I was ""going to make a scene"". The whole experience was extremely dishonorable and a terrible way to treat someone who had worked so hard in their time with the company.",Home Depot

I learned a lot about painting from the online trainings and from Glidden and Behr reps. My co-workers were funny and made it enjoyable to come to work most days. Opportunity to get really good at color theory. They have a wide range of shifts to work so it makes it easy for a night owl college kid or single mom to work there and maintain some structure in their other endeavors. They offer lots of fun employee events and do a great job of providing a comfortable (air-conditioned) break room with fun employee engagement programs. The micro-communities that developed in all the different departments were enriching and provided new perspectives and encourage teamwork.,"The work can be exhausting and your feet kill at the end of the day. I am a klutz, so HD was a challenge at times. I would come home with entire buckets of paint spilled down my leg and would have some trouble in garden or lumber because I would get in the way of lifts and get yelled at (ha). If you are a perfectionist, prepare to stop being one. It gets so busy and fast-paced on weekends that you don’t always have time to be perfectly aligning stuff or worrying about a perfectly shiny counter. You just have to take care of that stuff during the slow times. Customers tend to ask for miracles and you have to understand and explain to less intelligent people about the science of light. The hours are rigid and it’s difficult to take vacation or be flexible and spontaneous in your personal life at all. While the scheduling works for someone with a strict pattern, it’s more difficult for a whimsical, free-spirited person to enjoy work/life balance (maybe they like it this way).

Being able to get time off whenever needed is also a great pro.,"I've personally worked at multiple stores. I've come to the conclusion that most environments at THD are toxic. Grown adults act like they're still in high school. They talk about and harass other individuals. Management doesn't do anything to stop this because they are also playing a part in the harassment. Management tries to get people written up because someone else doesn't like them even though they have done nothing wrong. The favoritism in most stores is astonishing. If you are not brown nosing, you will go nowhere, and your raises will be terrible. People get promoted because they're liked not because they deserve the promotion. These same people were later demoted because of failure to complete the duties of their jobs. Some of the customers who walk in there are rude as hell. You get screamed at constantly even if the customer is incorrect and you are following policy. When they ask for the manager, the customer gets anything they want even if it is a huge no that is against corporate policy. Department heads are never on the sales floor because they think they're entitled to sit around all day and do nothing.

I’m a hard worker that always follows the rules and helps or asks questions but the environment at Home Depot is just toxic. * 4 hr orientation to tell you useless stuff you could read about the company in 20 minutes * training is useless: 3 hours of safety videos that could be summed up on 1 or 2 pieces of paper. * no training for your actual position: how do I use the Home Depot phone? How do i do various types of transactions? How do I use their order management system? What are the basic aisles/locations of certain goods? Who do I call if ___? WHERE DO I GO THE FIRST DAY?!?! NONE of the managers told us or even knew so I literally ran around the store the first day trying to find a manager that would give me a simple answer. * you can request days off but only 1.5 months in advance and even then, most of the time it’s denied. If you’re already scheduled, good luck getting anyone to help you - they just send you in circles * understaffed * terrible management - not just in one store, it seems like all of them in the surrounding states * no store map directories - seriously? This would be great for customers too but when suggested, management said it was a waste of their time * PCs super slow so by the time it loads, customer is upset or leaves. They crash/reboot often * There is a manager that is always on vacation. Where’s HR? Vacation. store manager? Vacation this week. I have only seen once when someone is not on vacation. There are 4 main managers here. * managers are terrible (lazy, rude and arrogant). Lazy in every way: refuses to get out of chair to help employees and customers / don’t do any work *no one knows who to talk to / management will keep sending you in circles * automatically enrolled for their short term disability plan so you have to fight HR to CORRECTLY setup/link your account to corporate so you can access it * if you’re hired on you’re stuck with whatever hours they want you (ex. “I am completely open right now”. Hired (they only hire as PT. Hard to get FT). Later on due to school, health issues and life, you can only work mornings. “You were hired on with this availability.” Request Denied. Now you’re stuck working the ridiculous always changing / non consistent schedule. * Hired as PT. “It’ll be about 20-22 hours a week”. LIES. They always schedule you for more but not quite FT (ex 37.5 hours). Even if you tell them oh hey, I need my hours reduced to the 20-22 we discussed, they will not help you. Even if you try to let management know that you will not and absolutely cannot be at work __ day, they send you around in circles again and you will end up being written up as a no show. * As a customer - Expensive! you have to be really careful on prices as a shopper. Ask for the marked down clearance items. They charge 20¢ here and there but then some if their items are ridiculously marked up $50. Try to do it online on amazon or Lowe’s. * “Even if you don’t like the department or position, we’ll take care of you and you can transfer immediately” Again, LIES: Cannot transfer to another department until after a full 6 months. * They literally hire and pay people to bring in carts. Where are the carts? Still outside while employees are sitting around (and hiding in the back) talking to other employees so customers have to do it instead. * Wasteful company. They do not donate or reuse any of their damaged or un sellable clearance items at all. Instead they throw it all into trash. Even the aprons are not washed, they just throw it away and get a new one. * they want lots of young part time employees that don't question anything because they are too busy, new to the workforce or just need the money * You’re lucky to get breaks. Even if you aren’t in your department, you’ve gotta (or at least should) help customers asking questions on your way to the break room. By the time you get to the break room, it’s been 20+ minutes. So to your department it looks like you took extra break time when really you just started. Most employees ignore or tell customers I’m on break, but then you have upset customers. If you take your break then everyone else around you is frustrated. * Employees hide in the back or stand behind huge items so customers do not see them. Have to chase them down then they pretend they didn’t hear you. * Little advancement: eventually you can get hired on as FT. But if you look at the managers (store, region, etc) it took them well over a decade to even get the most basic promotion . * They bully and intimidate you into donating to the homer fund. This place seems nice on the outside but is toxic. *Leads/pro referral services is a joke. More like a list of contractors to avoid in this area. Contact method listed will be spammed. * Terrible benefits. Super expensive but if it’s the only one then you’re stuck with it Summed up: Management sets you up to fail.",Home Depot

They taught me how to do some DIY on my own home.","For the first two years, I absolutely loved my job. I loved everything about it. I had full intensions to stay forever and hope to work above and beyond to show I would be a good candidate for management. Very suddenly most of our upper management were moved to other stores. I tried to stay positive and adjust to what the new management team expected while also trying to stand out as a top cashier and worked harder and handled many concerns without needing to always call a manager. I was very successful and the customer left happy. I often had customers purposely seek my register out so they could say hello and we could chat for a minute while I rang up their purchases. I will admit I have a hard time with injustice and people not being treated like people and not just a number. I watched this happen more and more everyday. Management did not say ""hello"" or have any interaction with the exception of associates at their same level. I knew my experience with other positions I held at other companies could be a great asset to Home Depot. I spoke to several new managers and one of the senior managers about this and ask to give me a chance. I am assuming they did not feel I was ready (considering I ran an entire department (attractions) and over 70 employees at a time. I was very discouraged and my ego was rubbed raw. My husband got sick and he and I decided I was unhappy and I left Home Depot to spend time at home. I could have continued working, but I was so unhappy I felt my attitude did not need to be conveyed to the other cashiers and more importantly, our wonderful customers, I can put on a good face, but I was so disappointed with management and their treatment of the front line associates, I couldn't watch anymore.

Lot attendants at Home Depot are seen as the bottom of the caste system, even though they often work the hardest and have to be experienced with customer service as well. I had to push dozens of metal carts up the parking lot, which is a hill, during traffic and brutal weather conditions (storms, snow, summer heat, and so on). Meanwhile, customer service was expected - helping in the lumber department, tying down trees and wood to vehicles, disassembling grills, loading mulch, and getting propane tanks. General maintenance had to be done as well - salting the parking lot, shoveling snow, sweeping and mopping, and taking out the trash. The physical labor was insane even for a weightlifter like myself. Taking tips can get you fired even though employees are severely underpaid and overworked in all departments.

The core values they have are great to live by, but most managers forget they wear the same value wheel associates do.","Corporate doesn't chose good leaders for managers at the store level. The review process is poor and doesn't allow employees to be reviewed accurately for their hard work. Managers are not well educated on specialty, merchandising, or operations and how to resolve issues that arise; managers really need a lesson (or ten) about proper managerial decision making. They are inconsistent with following corporate policy and make their own rules when it is convenient for the MOD. Managers love to task associates at random (most HD employees can self-manage their time and department), and supposedly we aren't allowed to say no to them. Scheduling is atrocious, we are ALWAYS understaffed (and then managers wonder why customer reviews are poor). Most days I managed to run 3 separate departments on my own, but somehow managers never recognize that hard work in your yearly review. Speaking of hard work, if you want it to go unnoticed, work at this store. Best of all, management will set you up for failure in this store to make them look good.

Lots and lots of turnover without the foresight to treat current employees so they want to stick around. Had to have a car full of samples which allowed no room for any personal use of vehicle with passengers. Stated culture and values not adhered to in this division.

You learn a ton about products, companies, contractors, install methods, etc if you are willing to seek out that information from good sources. It's a job that can teach you skills you learn only by doing first hand.

Possibly one of the hardest in the store. You have to cut carpet, vinyl, blinds, and shelving. Process special orders, installs, give sound accurate advice and order everything perfectly or you will get written up (this is not that bad but management can blame you for unforeseeable mistakes or customers who just don't cooperate.) Call customers, HDMS, and manufactures and freight companies on a regular basis. Keep about 10 aisles and a desk spotless as much as possible including the dreaded tile aisle where customers pick up random tiles and move them all over the place everyday when trying to select them. Drop pallets with equipment for customers and other departments and finally do all returns before close. All while being tracked for sales, measures, leads and credit cards more strictly than other employees that add nothing to you income as it's not commission. Essentially this all boils down to having to perform all these duties nobody else can seem to do often at the same time. so you will be at the desk processing a expensive order that needs attention and excellent customer service and 4-5 customers interrupting your sale every few minutes for a blind or carpet to be cut making it difficult to help everyone to the best of your ability.

They are moving teams away from the main SSC building in Smyrna to smaller buildings in Marietta (MTC) to alleviate horrific parking issues. But this also means no access to the full-service gym, large cafeteria and; daycare. 2)You only get 6 federal holidays. You do not get the day after thanksgiving off FYI, so you have to use your PTO for that. Also,no holidays between Jan 2 and Memorial day. 3) If you are coming from another company with perks such as free meals, delicious catered lunches etc, then you will be in for quite a transition. The MTC cafeteria has limited options, some really rude staff and is disorganized at best. The cafeteria in the main SSC building has more options and better service since some C-level execs/senior leadership eat there.",Home Depot

Then at other times, when there were no customers, I would make a phone call to schedule a medical appointment.

But this is what happens when a company doesn’t value higher education, maturity or leadership skills. Just gotta be able steam a mirror and kiss up to the right people.

Speaking of SOP-anyone who works there, become familiar with this. This is the Bible of law for the company and will be violated on a regular basis by management teams for their own benefit. Knowing the rules will keep you out of trouble and not caught up in their garbage. And violations are a plenty within this company. Not only do they regularly violate the company’s rules, but also possibly criminal laws on a regular basis.

They do not understand at all than a 5 foot, 120 lb. female cannot lift as much as a 6 foot, 170 lb. male can. They seem to think that it shouldn't take longer than TWENTY MINUTES to finish a pallet, even if there are more than 60-70 boxes on it, bearing in mind that you have to individually scan each one (if you're even lucky enough to HAVE a scanner), locate its home, see if it will fit, get a ladder if need be, and carve the box open and lift/stock the item. I was consistently given tasks that were extremely difficult for one person to do alone, let alone someone who is literally physically incapable of doing them, and then I would routinely get called back for conferences with my manager about not meeting the 4 pallets/hr quota. After awhile this started to really bog down my self-esteem, as I was made to feel worthless and lazy, even though I had NEVER been working so hard before in my life. I was also told that I wasn't even doing the bare minimum, even on days when I completed many tasks to try to prove myself to my manager. I almost had an asthma attack 6 times. Almost fell off a ladder 3 times. Nearly passed out from the heat several times. I was busting my tail and the only time I was ever talked to was to be told I'm not working hard enough. I almost put my back out trying to lift 80 lb. boxes of bleach and my manager exaggerated saying they were only 20 lbs. It literally said on the side of the box, 80 lbs. God forbid you can't physically lift something on your own, or they will roll their eyes at you like you're a weakling. When I asked for help lifting something, they would LITERALLY respond with ""Oh you can do it! GIRL POWER!"" I was also yelled at for taking a bathroom break longer than 5 minutes even though the manager and several choice favorite employees would take random 10-15 cigarette breaks whenever they pleased.

That diminished over time. Now we are spread terribly thin, and sometimes there are only two or three sales associates in the whole store in the evening. When someone quits, they are not replaced. Department heads are now expected to also work the floor as well as keep up with their regular duties, and departments are merged so that there are half the DHs as formerly. Associates are expected to offer outstanding customer service, do aisle maintenance, and do a lot of stocking. If it is busy and you can't get to the maintenance, you are looked upon as a slacker. It has become extremely stressful, and we are having a lot of injuries because of working too fast. - NO employee discount. Yes, you read that right. They offer ""Perks at Work"", which is a third party discount service that offers discounts on stuff most of the hourly workers can't afford in the first place. Just give us a discount and forget that other stuff. - They hammer the employees to push credit cards. I am NOT comfortable with that. I couldn't wait to leave the front end because of that pressure. - Management is in a bubble. They also seem threatened by intelligent subordinates. - My store is in the Bible belt, and though Corporate stresses acceptance and diversity (and keeping politics and religion out of the workplace), our store seems to be run by a clique that all attend the same fundamentalist church. There has been some proselytizing, which I don't appreciate. - A lot of the work is very heavy and physically very demanding. Also a lot of walking on concrete. Sometimes I rack up as much as 5 miles on my app. You will need good shoes. - Awards are given to those whom management likes, and if they don't like you, you won't ever get them. If you earn one by meeting certain goals, it will be very grudgingly given. It can be very discouraging to work hard and see slackers getting award after award. - The company has their ""values"" on every apron, but the only one that actually matters is ""increase shareholder value"".

Supporting each other and volunteering to help is something I enjoyed. Competitive wages $11 an hour! But that's about it for me since I wasn't there long.,"I understand that every Home Depot is different. But for me, there were a lot of cons. It's going to be a long post based on my short personal experience. No hours. One time I only had 9 hours for the whole week. I was use to 40 a week from my last job, but I was forced to leave because of car trouble. Training is mostly computer based. Which I can understand to a degree. But, I didn't even get to complete the training before being put on the floor. And when I was put on the floor, the environment was completely different from computer based learning. Customer service. Now, this is a con for me because, even though I can be a people person. Being told to always be friendly is an annoyance. More so because I tend to be very quite when people aren't on my immediate area. Also I have to be engaging when checking out customers. Which, is a skill that is learned, but it's not something I am use to. So if you are an introvert, good luck lol. House Keeping. When I first started I was told to keep my area clean and organized. But later I get told not to organize the surrounding area. It was confusing and conflicting statements. More over, they want to keep the store clean, but every piece of merch I scanned was dusty! Cards. I understand company policy, but I am not a fan of having to ask every customer ""Would you like to apply for a Home Depot card?"" Or the process of them applying since it takes so long. Most of my customers either had a card or were in there early 20s, which most of them didnt want a card. Self checkout. This is a weird one for me. At other stores, self check is an option where customers check themselves out. At home depot, we have to check you out there as well? We ask for cash or card and personally check you out. It's confusing and convoluted. It is much more logical to help those who need it. Most young adults know how to check themselves out by themselves. Cell phones. When I started i was told that we can use our cell phones to help customers find products. Which I thought was awesome. Home Depot has an app you can download to help find anything in the store. But once again, I was told to not use my phone. And I'm sure they meant in a ""check fb"" way. But seeing as how I would see other cashiers snapchatting or taking IG photos while at work only for me to be told not to do it?? How strange..... Talking. This doesn't mean there's a no talking rule. What this means is that, me being an introvert, I am very to myself. So one day I just decided to be more personable to the other cashiers, since I see them doing it as well, so I walk over and join the conversation. Only to be told the next day to not leave from around my area and not walk around.... Register setup. Maybe it's because I am paranoid, but having the cash be visibly to the customer is just a weird set up for me. There's no real way to explain the setup unless you see it. But it was weird for me. Also, the fact that a customer can walk up to any checkout and if you are signed in, they can technically check themselves out since there's no preventive measures, like putting in a unique password before checking them out (something I was use to at Walmart) All in all, the overall ideals of the company were something that I enjoyed, the Homer Fund, the partner discounts, and the pay. However, if a job pays well, but gives you less than 20 hours for 2 weeks of work. It's not worth it in my opinion, unless you are a student.",Home Depot

I met a lot of nice customers and on the rare occasion when I was actually able to talk to customers about plants, it was fun. My coach was very nice. She and another one of the stand in managers gave me a lot of help and mentoring as I got familiar with the place. The day went fairly fast The money wasn't too bad for a retail job",No teamwork for the most part. I was hired with the understanding that I was only available certain hours and it was immediately dismissed by the scheduler. The manager gave us this whole song and dance about how dedicated he was to his employees at hire and then I never saw him again. Very poor communication between management and staff. If it had not been for the self service system they have I would have been lost. Customers come in grouchy a lot of the time so you are often met with a lot of hostility. Wearing an orange apron sometimes can turn you into a punching bag for people who are miserable that they have to be there on a Saturday. It can be extremely difficult not to tell some of them to go jump in the lake. The courtesy desk-at least in our store was anything but courteous. No matter how nicely you approached them or even if you were bringing a customer to them they acted as if you were wrecking their whole day. There were times when I was embarrassed by the way they'd be treating someone who was spending close to a thousand dollars on a grill. Good luck getting a lift to help you bring something down for a customer. I have stood there for 40 minutes sometimes waiting for someone while a customer grew more and more upset. I found a few of my co-workers to be downright rude-including one of the managers in my own department who seemed to think it was acceptable to walk past me each morning without even saying a word. There were a lot of uneducated people working there who didn't have very good people skills or the ability to talk about appropriate things when in the break room. If you are new and you get stuck with something or you are not sure what to do you could twist in the wind for a very long time trying to find someone who can give you a hand. Even the managers are on the floor chasing themselves all day. It makes it a very frustrating place to work.

Over 2 years at one location, left them to seek employment elsewhere only to return to them at the Baytown location in Texas. Store 6507. It was a warm welcome back to a company I have enjoyed working for before. I had their culture and work ethic engraved into my being from day one. I did everything in my power to do what is best for the customer. I still practice that to this day. I grew up under the Home Depot and it helped shape me into the man I am now. I had a fair pay, fantastic benefits, an understanding manager, a wonderful open-door policy, and great people to work with coming from a variety of different cultures and backgrounds. -Benefits outweigh pay so don't expect to make a lot work there unless you have been there for a long time. -Depending on your store, people are often friendly and understanding. Especially your co-workers. -The culture is possibly the best in corporate history. I have never seen a company so dedicated to their employees as the Home Depot. Other companies should learn from them. -The ability to move around and even change locations is very easy. -The support they offer to students is amazing. It is a very good company to work for. I would encourage people to start here so that we can flood the future working world with well-disciplined and hardworking employees.","Unfortunately, this is where the title of this review begins. In mid-February, I had a conversation about a black associate in the presence of another black associate. No one else just us two. I believed that the associate and I were on great terms and I had been open and honest with her in the past. I have been working with her for almost a year now. The conversation was about another black associate and how they refused to perform their work duties. The conversation ended with both of us agreeing that the employee had been making improvements to their work ethic and I should ease up on criticism. I agreed, and we went on with our jobs. A few days later I find out that the black associate that I had been speaking to, accused me of calling the other associate, that the conversation was about, the N-word. I denied ever saying such a word and even wrote a statement. After an investigation by corporate, I was terminated from employment due to the severity of the situation. According to the termination papers I received, I violated the Respect Policy. The situation became a He-Said/She-Said debate and since she is black and a female and I'm a white male, her word is more valid than mine. I will take this as a lesson learned and move on. My experience is unique and is not a reflection on the all employees or all stores and their management teams. It is depressing that a company I had adored and loved was willing to toss me away to secure their title as ""An Equal Opportunity Employer."" I was treated unfairly multiple times and even skipped over for a promotion 4 times despite having greater experience and knowledge than my supervisors whom I had 5 total in my 2 years of being there. The 6-month record for all write ups prevents good employees from advancing and instead, promotions are given to people who ""suck up"" to management. If you really want to be promoted in the Home Depot, you need to shred yourself free of your pride and dignity. I never believed this to be true until I worked at the Baytown location. The wrong people have been promoted and the hard-working people who understand their co-workers better than management are often punished or ignored for promotion. I even had a bad experience at the Clear Lake Shores location where a manager yelled at me for asking for help. This doesn't reflect all stores but unfortunately, certain stores are very poorly managed or bad places to work at. You will often hear of good stores and people will try to transfer there. The Baytown location is by far the worst place to work. I am likely being bias, but I have a right to be. Managers will have ""coachings"" with you and advise you on how to improve your performance. This can be great except, they record the conversation without informing you and leave ""notes"" on the conversation they had with you and you are NOT permitted to read them. So, a manager can and will say anything they want to you and make ""notes"" stating something else and you cannot confirm them. You can be written up for minor things and write ups can prevent you from getting promoted or transferring. I was written up the second day after getting out of the hospital from recovering from an illness and the write up was for, ""Voluntary Insubordination."" -You do not have the freedom to speak your mind, even in the Break Room. If anyone hears what you said, they can simply tell management and you can be written up. I was once written up for complaining about driving an hour to work for a 4-hour shift. My write up was for ""Poor Integrity."" -Most customers are very rude and disgusting. Needles and used condoms are found daily and so are dip cups. Baytown store. -Management is a mix bag depending on your store. Store managers are very disconnected with their employees despite being friendly and trustworthy, do not expect him/her to solve your problem. -Resolutions are often very slow. -There is favoritism sadly so make good friends with management and the higher ups to get promoted. -The company stands behind certain races and ethnicity more so than others. Figure out which one your store supports the most. And good luck with that uphill battle to promotion. -Good employees often get selected by other companies and leave. This means bad/lazy employees will be the most common people you work with. -Drama is a problem so keep your life mostly to yourself unless you really trust the co-worker. Keep in mind, my experience was great up until certain managers left and others got promoted. I had a very unique experience, so this does not reflect the company as a whole, but it certainly is a bad stain on their ethics as a company. I do wish I could return there but maybe its best that I do not. To sum it up, it's a great place to start but seek better employment elsewhere or be a student.",Home Depot

3581,"""Toxic Culture That Doesn't Adhere to its Own Values""",1.0,The Store Support Center is a nice environment to work in.,"The culture at the Home Depot is toxic. The company Values emphasize building strong relationships, showing respect for others, entrepreneurial spirit, and other things that sound great. There's an inverted pyramid that puts the associate first and the CEO last. These are nice decorations, but the company doesn't even pretend to try to live up to these values. There's an unhealthy obsession with rank and title at THD. Merchants are revered and feared; many pitch temper tantrums and scream and yell to get what they want. Vice Presidents and above are treated as if they are gods, and lower associates really aren't supposed to be talking with them. My director would frequently arrive late to meetings and announce that she had been meeting with this RVP or that MVP or was in a meeting where the CFO was speaking, as if there wasn't a need to be courteous to her team as long as she was doing Important Things with Important People. I'm a person that likes to find new ways to do things, to improve upon old processes and make them better, faster, or more accurate. Entrepreneurial Spirit as a value appealed to me when I started. I quickly found out however, that every single suggestion I could make was unwanted and unappreciated. The entire company uses the same PowerPoint background, for crying out loud, and any deviations from this are forbidden. If you can't tolerate a different background on the screen, how much are you really embracing Entrepreneurial Spirit? When I was hired, I was told that the company does a horrible job of training. This was true. There are no documented processes, and in fact not even a single sheet of paper that tells the person training you what to train on. It's a hit or miss process, yet they seem to be proud of this. In fact, after I'd been there several months, I discovered I was doing something wrong. I confessed this to my manager, and he was surprised ... he had been doing things the same way. When I explained why it was wrong and described the right way to do it, he said ""That makes more sense."" If the leadership can't even refer to a printed process to make sure they are training their people correctly or to audit the work that's being done, then they have little control. Where I work, five associates have been the HR to complain about the treatment they receive from our Director. Three have been out with stress related illness. Others have taken demotions to get away from this one leader. And yet still, the company allows that Director to use up and dispose of people in a constant churn. One coworker, who quit after just a few months, told me ""I've never worked so hard for a job I hate so much. I'm afraid to even go to the bathroom for fear I'll miss a deadline."" A number of coworkers express frustration. Many have said they are hoping Amazon will open an office nearby. Several have told me that they are looking for work elsewhere. The company culture simply chews up people and spits them out, only to move on to the next body to fill a seat.",Home Depot

If you're easily assimilated into the ""Good Ol' Boys"" club, you will do well here.","4 years ago, this was a fantastic place to work. As soon as senior management changed that year, it began its slow decent. Most of the initial turmoil was contained at the management level. Intimidation and harassment paired with a ""Good Ol' Boys"" club is a recipe for disaster for anyone that wasn't in said club and this impacted both women and men in management. In 2015 and 2016 management turnover doubled to what it has been in prior years. It didn't matter if you were a horrible leader, if you got the numbers, you were promoted. When it became apparent that the dissatisfaction began to permeate at the hourly employee level, upper management put together a presentation for the hourly employees to illustrate why it was so great to work at that facility. If someone has to tell you why it's so great because you're not feeling it, then it's not a great place to work. Talk has less weight than action. There is no professionalism at the middle and senior management level and they don't seem to care that they are stepping over the line when it comes to employment law infractions. There is a constant corporate presence in the building for a reason, and it's not just an issue of operational performance, it's lack of true leadership skills and integrity that they are digging into. Work Life Balance - there is none for salaried employees. 10 days off a year until you've been with the company for 5 years, then it goes up to 15 days. Considering you're expected to work holidays that they are open (you're only off on Thanksgiving day and Christmas day), and 10 hour days are the norm during non-peak season, it's a slap in the face when senior management expects you to work 3 four-hour Saturday shifts to earn 1 extra day off (8 hour day, mind you).",Home Depot

Yet new employees walking in the door are making the same wage I am at this time because of an across the board wage increase for new hires in due to a competitive Amazon warehouse pulling from the employee pool in the area. I train the new hires as a coach, I am a team safety captain, and receive terrific performance reviews every 6 months, yet I’ve been told that if I don’t become a supervisor, I won’t see a bump in pay. This means I’m spending my time training new hires that are making the exact same wage I am. I have no desire to move up at this point in my life (2nd career). So now I’m backed into a corner. If I don’t move up to supervisor, I will then step down as captain and coach and then become the mediocre run of the mill employee they’re forcing me to become instead of the “go getter” they have in me now. I’m not a big union person, but I feel a workers union would have protected my wage and I would have been compensated for my efforts, but they drink the KoolAid at HD and it’s taboo to even mention the word “Union” to management. I don’t see the justice in HD’s logic about fair compensation and it’s very disheartening for a 4 year loyal employee to be making the same wage as a new hire walking in the door. I understand the whole “At Will”employer issue, and that’s why I feel a union would have protected my wage against this.

That was awesome, too bad it's not like that anymore. Anyway the part time benefits received lots of local discounts as well as medical discounts (90% if I remember). At my preferred store (as I later transferred) my management team would always come up with incentives to work harder with seriously gracious cash bonuses. Participation was optional, but the rewards were worth the extra initiative. There were always oppurtunites to make a little more money there.

Home Depot is very proud of all their new tech from the much lauded First Phone to their robotic ordering system which is the source of major headaches for freight. This ordering system was explained to me one night. Basically, they have buyers who visit a vendor and set up a deal to buy 100 widgets at $1 each. The vendor says, ""I'll sell you 500 widgets at .80¢ each for a bulk discount. So, the Home Depot buyer will take the bait and then each store gets shipped box after box of product that has no proven track record of selling. Yes, it's simply a crapshoot. This ordering system floods the store with unsellable product which plugs up the bays and makes organization and pack-out very difficult. Then associates get blamed for not packing down product or not putting product in the overhead of the bay where the product is sold. In the old days, human intelligence did the ordering. Now a computer will order product according to what is sold at checkout along with many ""luck of the draw"" items sent from the warehouse. So, many freight jobs are extremely difficult because you have to constantly shove unwanted product in little holes and shelf corners. You'll stare in disbelief at like 300 yellowjacket traps for $19.99 that nobody wants because there is a video on YouTube on how to build one for free with an old Coke bottle. Management is also completely dysfunctional. For all their technology, they do not communicate at all. One manager will tell you not to come in and another will wonder why you didn't show up. They seldom come into the aisles to see how you're doing with your job. Instead they like to rely on all their software. They worship what the spreadsheets tell them. Most of the reprimanding you will receive will be according to their software telling them something isn't right. Nevermind that you are being asked to do an impossible task most of the time (eg: run 3 departments at once; pack down a bay in 20 minutes). It's a typical situation where they want you to know they are there for you and when you ask for help, you generally get jibberish SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) rules. They rarely try to understand your plight on a level of empathy or intuition. The ""Veteran Staff"" are all sloths who have mastered the very ARTFORM of not doing any work and blaming new hires for what is wrong. They are masters at whining and hiding. They have like a thousand hiding places so as not to be found when customers need help. A typical example of their laziness is not bothering to pack down product during the day and leaving all that work for freight at night. Then blaming freight because no product is packed down. They are masters of ""walking slow"" across the store and taking a 20 minute bathroom break. It's almost comical to watch. When they are in dark areas of the store (no eyes/cameras), they move like sloths would, slow motion. Every now and then, you'll come to the break area and see lofty yet obscure adjectives written on the dry erase board such as ""synergizes"". They love acronyms. Just take a word like ""PIG"" and pick three corporate concepts to add to it. ""Profit! Integration! Global Audience!"". I can see them in there, behind closed doors, pounding the words on the board with their hands and then telling the ASMs to go out there and pound those employees with more adjectives and acronyms. Eh, but what can you do. A job like this is about is good as you will get in the modern day without education. Society is collapsing and Home Depot has all the symptoms. They will be a dead company in the next 20 years, killed off by Amazon and internet shopping. Even lumber will ordered online, packed by robots and sent via drone.

Many of them make more than execs from NON-retail industries. If the store workers are paid so low, the executives should also have their pay drastically reduced. Store workers treated poorly via work schedules that change daily, low pay, and store managers who are told to say stupid things to the workers like, ""break up this pumpkin patch."" That statement is code for ""hey employees, do not dare talk about getting in a union to help you."" Store assistant managers abused with 60 hour work weeks every week and low pay. They are given inane tasks to do. The managers of the store have to do cleaning in the store because the co is too cheap to hire more janitors. Products mostly cheap chunk from China. Top management puts on a good PR show to the public which is lies, especially when they pretend to do philanthropy. Charity begins at home, so this company needs to start their charity by improving things greatly for their workers like better pay. There are way too many stupid rules the employees must follow. Employees in store often get fired for breaking a minor store rule. They opened too many stores across America with low-wage, meaningless store clerk jobs with no future for the store employees. The only job the store clerk can move up to is assistant manager and that is the very worst job in the company where you basically go to work each day for long hours, go home to sleep; wake up and repeat. Forget about having a life if you are an assistant store manager. Company is too cheap to put enough workers in the store so customers know that most of the time they can never find anyone to help them. This is a company that discourages the employees from thinking and making good suggestions. They want you to shut up and be stupid and follow their dumb rules. They try to brainwash the employees with pointless meetings and fake cheers. When the electricity goes out in a store, they force the workers to keep working in a building with NO AIR for their whole shift even if the electric is off all day. This happened to me and I almost fainted. Their backup generators DO NOT provide AC or anything like that for the employees! The generators only keep on a few lights and just enough for this cheap company to keep selling to make money. The overnight shift job is terrible - they turn off the air for the entire shift of these workers! These overnight workers don't even have air to breathe. They do not pay the overnight workers more for hurting their health by working overnight and doing very heavy lifting. There is no overnight shift increase. Why do they have a huge, fancy office at headquarters and private dining room there for the execs when the managers in the stores have offices that are broom closets? In fact, the managers don't even have an office, only the store manager does and his/her office is a broom closet.",Home Depot

Overall, an okay place to get your experience up, but not a place where you'll want to stay longer than a couple of years.

For example, we have spent an entire day (almost 8 hours) putting up displays etc for a new event, and the store mgr will wait until it's almost time to go home to check our progress and then decide she wants things done in a completely different way.

4910,"""If you have PTSD or any other mental disability with physical symptoms do not apply.""",1.0,If you have no disabilities and can get in socially with managment you can get promoted with hard work.,"When I was hired i was asked if I had any disabilities that may interfere with my work. I stated that I have PTSD and an anxiety disorder that were documented and I was hired within a few days and given a cashier position part time. I did fairly well then, and eventually moved on to the deliveries dept. I did well there and was promoted to full time. Shortly after this the entire political system changed and I was continuously forced into unreasonable scenarios. For example the service desk endlessly interrupting me when they had three people there playing with their phones to go get them items from receiving. The same people would then complain that the deliveries were behind when they were interrupting me. Repeat forever. Customer interruption was never factored in and the dept was constantly understaffed because of turnover rate (for these same reasons) and one associate constantly calling out. This started to elevate my symptoms until it became unbearable and I started having severe panic attacks. After months of begging and pleading the store manager finally accommodated me by moving me to the parking lot as I requested. By this time my condition had severely worsened from a combination of work drama and losing a close family member, and rising medical expenses. Once I settled into the lot job I started feeling a lot of relief as the routine was simple, I was always busy, and customer interaction was lower than usual. Eventually they started scheduling me also on cash register because they over hired for the parking lot and there were 7 of us at once and the rest were part timers and they were getting 4-8 hours a week so they started putting me on register again. With my worsened condition I began having panic attacks on register. My eyes rolled into the back of my head, I lost the ability to hear because my ears rang so badly, I saw stars, my chest hurt, I became nausious, lightheaded, etc. They let me finish that shift in the lot. The next day I tried again, same results, they grudgingly let me work elsewhere after chewing me out. The following day when it happened again I was given a lecture from mangment that despite my condition I had a job to do and If i did not do it I would be written up for insubordination. They did not believe my condition was real because it did not happen when I started there. After 5 days in a row of this and little to no sleep I had exhausted my personal/sick time entirely and missed too many days and one more would result in termination because of this uncontrollable situation. I came to work and was brought into the office and threatened with termination if I did not ""perform"" on register. I had a severe panic attack crying, hyperventilating etc. I was placed on a forced medical leave to prevent further missed shifts counting against me after I begged and cried for two hours. They kept saying ""do you have anything else you want to say?"" over and over to try to shut me up and told me to get back on register. ""we can not do anything to help you"", ""our hands are tied"" ""we can not do more for you because it would be unfair to other associates"", ""if the people that work in blinds decide they don't want to cut blinds we do not just let them stop"", ""you were fine when you started here and nothing has happened to make you worse here"", were the types of answers they were giving me. Previously two times they had sent me home early excused to not count against me, by this time they refused to do that anymore and demanded I once again get on register knowing what will happen. I got so sick my chest pain was unbearable and I went to the emergency room where I was put on an EKG and had my heart tested. I had the doctor fill out accomodation paperwork for me which he was happy to do and I turned it in to the store. I was eventually contacted by the store manager during my leave who told me that I needed to have it redone by a primary care doctor which I did not have and that I had six days to get one, and get the paperwork redone, after I had not been paid on leave for nearly two weeks. Somehow I actually managed to get a new primary care and appointment on day 5 of 6. I was allowed to return to work after being cleared by the same doctor from the ER and a counselor I was forced to see as well. I returned on day 4. At the start of my return shift I was told that even though the store manager gave me 6 days it had been rejected on day 3 (because I told them I would have the paperwork on day 4 probably) and not only do I need to re apply but I am expected to be on register in the meantime. At this point they had documentation from a medical professional, a psychologist, and pending primary care doctor documentation and still demanded I work register. This is also after hiring many new cashiers. I was once again told that even if I am working the lot and am requested to get on register and I refuse it is insubordination and I can be terminated.

Crap scheduling practices that put stores interests well above employees life. As like most big box employers, have not figured out the balance between keeping workers happy with scheduling and well compensated would equal to better productivity which in turn leads to better sales. Crap benefits. Another example of a ""corporate welfare"" taker company. This is where compensation, quality of life, and expensive benefits costs borne by employee lead them to seek social safety nets like SNAP, Medicaid, WIC, housing assistance programs, etc. and corporations knowingly keeping compensation low and benefits capped and unaffordable so that they get out of paying living wages, thus maximizing their profits. Assistant Store Managers are overworked, underpaid, and have several lawsuits in play for not being compensated for work performed. Imagine their effectiveness in managing and their mindset after getting shafted week after week. Most are ineffective zombies who are hanging on by a thread in the busier stores, who are always putting out fires and not managing. Tools to resolve customer service complaints need rethinking. Inadequate staffing levels to meet customer demand due to heavy reliance on metrics for comparative daily, monthly, and quarterly sales. No real coaching of employees. Just another crap company selling crap products who are getting away with paying and treating employees crap wages and benefits.

Minority women are *HIGHLY* coveted in this company to promote to management. In general, they like to promote women quite frequently. When I started with this company 12 years ago, I really bought into their policy of ""taking care of our employees"" & treating them as if they are family. In the past couple of years I would say that HD has gone away from that almost completely.","There is DEFINITELY a huge change in this company. There has been an obvious shift from the original founders values to one of basically just doing the bare minimum to meet sales plan, and at any cost; including firing people simply because they make too much an hour (This after years of dedicated service.) This means letting go of GOOD, HONEST, HARDWORKING individuals who have lived and exemplified the standards HD set forth. Now, it's all about cheap labor, and the company comes first, period. Inconsistent with handling problem employees; policies and procedures are not adhered to consistently leaving employees confused and wondering why there are different policies and procedures followed one minute, & different ones another. Managing employees is difficult with this company as sometimes discretion is left up to the Store Manager one minute, the next it is left up to ASM. No clear and precise way of handing specifc issues when they arrise even after taking concerns to upper management in an effort to resolve this issue. Employees often complain about being fearful of being fired for making miniscule mistakes. I can't say as I blame them for feeling that way as well. No one should have to feel that way ever. EXAMPLE: If there is an issue that management isn't sure how to handle, they call corporate headquarters in Atlanta. Corporate has a TEAM of lawyers who make a recommendation as to what action they feel needs taken. It is simply a recommendation mind you. That information is then passed to the appropriate management member and is either handled by them directly or the store manager. Often times any decison on firing is at said managers discretion; he or she may or may not heed corporates recommendation. Ultimately, it is up to the SM. I left after being asked to fire an employee for something other employees had not only done, but had a habit of doing repeatedly. The employee I was asked to fire had never had a write up. He was an extremely hard worker. His mistake was picking up a beverage to go on break, not paying for it, & taking it to the breakroom. He received a phone call from a customer while on the way to the breakroom, & set the drink down. (Per an investigation which included reviewing survellience footage.) He,never drank the beverage but since he didn't pay for it immediately it was seen as stealing. He was told that here firing was not in any way shape or form a reflection of her integrity or work ethic while employed by HD. They also acknowledged that he was an EXCELLENT employee who made a mistake simply because of said integrity and commitment to her job. This employee then asked if termination was at the recommendation of corporate or at the managers' joint decision. The Store Manager said that she was basing the termination on corporates reccomendation; she also conveyed that she knew she had the authority to make a decison based on her own judgement if she chose to so do so. She chose not to do so. In addition: this employee was in the process of being promoted and was one of the highest paid employees in said store and district as well. Draw your own conclusion if you will. The only thing I can POSSIBLY say to somehow remotely justify the actions taken here is that Colorado is a ""right to work"" state. HD isn't in the habit of simply firing people though. They make sure to document EVERYTHING so as to avoid any appearance or implication of discrimination. Based on the direction the company is going now, I would dare say the firing was prompted to ""cut some fat"" in order to reduce costs and meet sales plan. Secondly, District managers are terribly angry, hostile and unhappy which resonates throughout the company like a ripple effect. There is a continual change in job titles, as well as duties; coupled with shuffling of new district managers. In the 6 years I was an ASM, there were 3 different District Managers. Just when you had gotten into a rhythm of what to expect (professionally as well as specific to personality traits) a new DM was arriving. Each time the end goal was different and usually the complete opposite of said previous District Manager. Changes were made, unmade, then reinstituted once again; causing for a lack of cohesiveness throughout the store as well as the District. I understand full well that change is needed in order to grow and stay relevant in the workplace. However, fixing something that isn't broken isn't change for that purpose; it is simply changet for the sake of change. I quickly learned the hard way a majority of changes were made by DMs simply to promote THEMSELVES personally in their desire to become noticed & in hopes of further advancing their careers. Little to no feedback from store staff was considered even when specific customer complaints were offered up.",Home Depot

Not everyone here is like that. Some of us are educated, well spoken, well dressed, and took the job here hoping to get our feet in the door of this company not knowing the perception of the call center and are now stuck because they assume the entire call center is unprofessional (I've had that told to me by associates and leadership at the SSC when asking about an application process)",Home Depot

When you page a manager, the managers hide in managers office and doesn't responds to any calls to them on their first phones. Too many meetings. The one manager even admit to me is lucky that the labor department didn't come after them with all these complaints. Management tries to pin the blame on you when a customer complains without hearing your side of the story and expects you to sign their pathetic write up without showing proof or investigating both ends even if you ask them making you feel set up and fire you anyway. They return anything and everything at returns even stuff that the store doesn't sell and still give customers their money back sadly. They do anything to make your life miserable to try to make you quit. Word of advice, if they are about to fire you, DON'T sign anything. Especially full timers, you'll waive your rights to unemployment if you do. A new manager whether assistant or a new store manager comes in from another store and cleans house of associates they don't like and forms their own clique and if your not in it with them, your toast even if its your first write up even if they don't like you enough and the severity of the incident. They make you work in multiple departments with little or not training and if you say no that you don't know how to do something like cutting wood, metal or fixing something with or without training, they act as if its an act of defiance instead of teaching and coaching you and ask you to do something anyway that you know you don't know how to do without asking, if you do it and then if you get hurt, they deny responsibility ever telling you how to do it that they ever told you to do it as a setup. I have never worked in a store with so many ""walks"" and ""meetings"" that when you page a manager or supervisor, they are all of them are having lunch with associates in the break room or in a manager's meeting that they have more than once a week, or ""fraternizing"" especially with male managers and female associates and cashiers in the break room or all in a bi-weekly staff meeting and with no manager to be found when sign of trouble and when you page, none answer and then when they do, they scream at you like it was a big bother since they are all in a ""meeting"" like you disturbed them from their BS meeting when you or a customer requests a manager. One manager even admit to me that he ignores my calls or hide. Had I recorded it, I would have reported them to the labor department or Atlanta or if neither helped me, I would have sued. Its easy to make big bucks and not do anything to earn your keep and doing your job. I will miss one or two good managers in the store, supervisors and associates and the rest, good riddance, as well as the HR and ASDS that are a joke to and to them, this job and this company and the way they do business. They cut, cut, cut hours to part timers without checking the war boards thoroughly and leaving holes in departments leaving full timers with more work to do because they part timers didn't do squat and if you don't get it done, you get yelled at by your supervisor or manager that same day or following day afterwards when they return. No wonder the part timers don't care. Now they got rid of all the full time positions a few years back and closed 10 stores but opened new ones? They cut part timers to less than 29 hours to save on benefits and plus with Obamacare, they limit part timers do less than 29 hours to not have to offer health insurance anymore and even benefits. I remember being told by another full time employee that the most people last on average is 6 months when I was in my 90 day probation back in 2005. That ought to tell you about the company and culture at Home Depot that it stinks. Like any retail job, this place is a revolving door. Its good for a short term gig, but they will burn you out in the long haul if you make it just that. You ask for a weekend off even once a month every few weeks and a manager argues that its too much of a hassle for them to grant it to you yet you request it with more than two weeks in advance or more than that. They act as if Atlanta does it, but we know the stores also have a hand in the schedule assuming Atlanta also does it also like they claim they did. The fact that they got rid of HRMs is a joke and the HR and ASDS are just as utterly useless as much as some supervisors, all the ASMs, the store managers, district managers, regional managers, etc. Too many chiefs and not enough indians or managers in the company and half don't do anything as well as. presidents and vice presidents for everything whether national or regional?! Really?! Must be very easy to sit around on your butts and bark orders all day and do nothing for your money up and down the company ladder. You even have tenured associates thinking they they are managers also, when in fact they are just like you, AN ASSOCIATE, seniority or not, which is kinda sad. Too much power trips in the company. Unless I really have to as a last resort, I won't be giving them a dime of my hard earn money to this poorly run company. They are just as bad as their former CEO who later went to Chrysler and is one of the top 10 worse CEOs ever and is now in charge of Freedom Group. The current one isn't much better either. After all, he was his ""boy"". No wonder they don't want unions in the union training video they have that they force you to try to sign and if you don't, your fired, so they can boot you out the door for saying what you have to say even when they are in the wrong.

I am a good sales associate, and I have excellent customer service skills, and I was not interested in advancement, so it was a cushy gig for me.

There were good and bad associates at my store, but mostly good because a new store manager took care of most of the bad. I showed up for every shift, I did any job requested, I found plenty of work to do all of the time (customer service, in stock, store appearance). I sometimes slacked on the last two when there were opportunities on the first. I did mess up for about two weeks when I had some family issues, but management made sure this was not in my file (no tardies, not missed shifts) or noted for counseling, because I covered the aforementioned basics so well for so long. Home Depot and I worked well together. I went to work, they let me do my job. They never micromanaged me, a few attempts were easily thwarted. I knew what I was doing, and I got it done. Customers loved me. I handled customer problems without management, but when I needed a manager, they just signed off on whatever I had decided.

I do try to treat others with respect, so I guess what goes around comes around. I don't feel like someone is looking over my shoulder but I suppose that is because I DO what is expected of me and don't just stand around gabbing with co-workers. I feel like people are stealing time on the clock when they goof off while expected to work. They accommodate if you have restrictions such as bad back, etc. Co-workers are always friendly and seem to like their jobs as well and that creates an atmosphere where customers enjoy coming into that environment. One of the things I love is that customers are greeted at the door during peak times by an employee that stays in the front area during those times. That is not to say that we don't greet and offer help to every customer every time however when it is very busy it really is nice to have customers know exactly where to go when they are busy on weekends. We almost fight over who gets to help the customers at Home Depot---what other store offers that kind of help?--not many I assure you!. Before I worked here, I did some mystery shopping whereby you evaluate an employee/employees so I know exactly what to look for from the workers such as how many seconds/minutes did it take for an employee to greet and offer help, were they smiling, did they seem eager to help, etc. You don't ever have to worry about searching for someone to help or of receiving bad service here as it just comes naturally as they hire friendly, energetic people and have training which you must complete in order to become knowledgeable about the products and safety of the store. It is a great company to work with many benefits. They truly seem to care about their employees and everyone works together as a team which is the way it is supposed to be. I enjoy working here very much!","Sometimes it is hard to keep theft from happening, and it does happen, but it seems to me that if they employed security guards whos primary task is keeping an eye on what's leaving the store that theft would be down.

The sky is the limit in terms of advancement; my current DM (district manager) does not have a college education. He started with the company as a part time lot associate fifteen years ago. He makes $100k+ a year with $0 in student loans. Granted, we can't all reach that level of management, especially without a bachelor's degree. However, even an Assistant Store Manager hauls in about $50k, and most of them do not have a degree. Associates are recognized and rewarded for their efforts. You get what you give. If you are hard working and dedicated, you will get promoted (if you want). If you are lazy and believe you will advance by virtue of tenure, you are wrong. It took me just 8 months to become a Department supervisor, and I am now a key-carrier and hope to be promoted to ASM soon. I have been with the Home Depot for 4 years.","Associates at the Home Depot are subject to discrimination and favoritism. Those under-educated ASM's that I mention above essentially run the show, and we lesser employees are subject to their whims. Most ASM's are good people, but in my time I have worked with some real tyrants who abuse their authority. I had one in particular who tarnished my otherwise spotless record by writing me up 3 times in a 2 week span shortly after joining the store management team. I was very frustrated, and it was obvious he was making an example of me; flexing his metaphorical manager muscles. I complained to my Store Manager, who seemed shocked. I was quickly moved to another department and have not been written up since (3 years later). The ASM left the store within a year.",Home Depot

Needed an easy part time job, it's easy.","1.Online training is only as good as the person taking it. If you don't take notes while trading the class, then you won't be an effective sales person. Example: a customer asked me about a product in a department that wasn't mine, I couldn't find the answer and the specialist fur that area was not around. I asked if I choke get the customers number so we could help them...they were not interested. I found the specialist later and asked him the same question, and he saga it was the customer's responsibility to find out. The other two people that worked the area didn't know the answer either. I called the manufacturer to find out and shared the information with the three of them. That customer wanted a $500 item but did not buy it because no-one was around and if they were they wouldn't have known anyway. 2. Inventory: all departments have major issues with on hand counts being off. The Inventory management system, IMS is updated by a company who does inventory by visual count only (they see which item is in front and key it in, no manual count). It is nearly impossible to fix the count once it's off. The department supervisor does not have the ability to correct on hand counts, even for risks less than $100. The store supervisor had to approve them. It seems as if on hand counts are not corrected because it would affect their sales, and if sales don't meet quotas, then there are no bonuses. 2. Bonuses: Bonuses are structured to payout higher to managers and supervisors but sales floor personnel are hounded to get leads and up sales. Where is the motivation for floor personnel and cashiers? : example: I asked one of the assistant managers that question, he said meeting their job was motivation enough. 4. Staffing: key departments often, must of the time, have only one employee. The problems with this level of staffing is that the employee cannot meet their required job descriptions. Walking customers to the item they are looking for ( there's a line of people waiting to talk to you, you go to another department and are stuck there because the employee there is on break, on lunch, or overwhelmed as well... you have other tasking that if you don't complete you'll get written up). Generating leads... At least one a week, this is roofing, ac checks, flooring...if you don't have time to form relationships with customers, then how will you generate leads. Downstocking: filling holes on the shelves...see item two. If on hand count cans be fixed you can't fill holes...well you can, just stick something in there so you don't see a hole fill it with something. Staffing continued: when someone goes on lunch it means you are responsible for two departments.",Home Depot

I got in, did my work. ~Managers were nice; they really liked my work ethic, so they gave me a bit more leeway. ~most days, I worked as a lot tech ( glorified cart pusher), some days, I was working in a department like electrical or garden. ~At my location, most people were nice, well behaved, and managers did take notice of dedication. I could see myself rising to management positions if I had stayed. Keep in mind that workplace environment varies greatly by location. See if you can get a job at the top performing locations. ~You gotta look at the OrangeLife website; it's full of corporate discounts and whatnot, like taking a flat $25 off your ATT and Verizon plan, or getting a better deal from that car dealership I bought a Lenovo thinkpad @ 40% off and got points redeemed on that purchase to add a $100 prepaid card with it. For a bottom of the totem job, that's not bad. ~As a lot tech, I had a better chance to observe the workplace politics and 'who's who' in there. I also had a better chance of moving up is I got noticed. If I was a cashier, I'd be pigeon-holed in there and wouldn't get much further than Head cashier. READ THIS: The HD is actually a pretty nice place to work, if you get a good location and do your job. Granted, I was only there for like 4 months, but I had my fair share of encounters with irate customers. Subbing in for Electrical, Plumbing, Garden , (high demand/understaffed areas) will do that. I wasn't trained for any of these, but that's what coworkers are for. Proving that I learned on the job meant managers took more notice of me and slotted me for higher positions, even if I was only a 'sub'. When I left for a more major-relevant job, I'd already become a shoe-in for any department I wanted and I was giving evaluations for my fellow lot techs. Kind of sad to leave, but I couldn't let that degree I was earning go to waste. Overall, I quite enjoyed it. PS. The thing about dealing with irate customers is, you're in retail. That means you have very little 'real skills' required that can't be found in a random guy on the street. Unless you've been there for years, you're replaceable. As a result, you'll have to make yourself valuable, and the best way is to prove your customer service skills. Said service isn't just making returns easy and smiling; you also have to stand through a customer's yelling and screaming. It will feel like he's yelling at you, but you have to remember that this is your job and you can't take it personally. He's pissed at the Home Depot, not you, and you're home depot while you wear that apron. Let him vent, then try to appease him by offering alternatives, and always, always make them think you're on their side. It goes a lot easier if you're not trying to fight them. For reference, I had a Chinese construction company wait an hour for $4000 worth of lumber and supplies we didn't have at 9pm. Better yet, he only spoke Chinese and I had to try to appease him with my 4th grade level skills. I learned a lot more about those job search buzzwords like customer service skills, and fast learner. I can confidently say I posses those skills and more now, and I can definitely draw on my experience to answer those interview hard balls.","~Towards the end of my employment (better offer), a new guy was hired. He did absolutely nothing, and no one could locate him during his shifts. I get that the supervisors have to find something to nail him for, but damn if it didn't take a while. My coworkers were reluctant to point the finger too, but this SOB was MIA and the rest had to pick up the slack. Typically, we only have 2 lot techs when we close the store at night, but that guy threw his partner under the bus and left early. ~sometimes, lot techs would be blamed for not coming to assist customers in time.

The company recognizes it needs to change the way it does software development and it's trying new things.,"Corporate culture is toxic. Full-time associates and contractors on the same team are regularly pitted against one another when they should be working together. Management talks about developing a sense of collective ownership of the product, but in the next breath says that contractors are expendable. As such, contractors tend to show little initiative, instead waiting around to be told what to do. Corporate IT is in the middle of an Agile adoption but team leads and middle management still act like dictators. If you're truly Agile, you give the team a goal and let them come up with a solution that meets that goal. Instead, the team leads treat everyone else like children and tell them exactly what to do, leaving no room for negotiation. There's virtually no work-life balance. All software developers are forced into pair programming on dedicated pairing stations rather than on their issued laptops. If you need to work remotely for any reason, don't expect to get any work done. Management won't give you licenses to install the software on your laptop. The company hired a bunch of consultants from Pivotal Software to tell them how to do software development. And whatever Pivotal says is what goes. That includes using all of Pivotal's software like Pivotal Tracker and Pivotal Cloud Foundry, which aren't necessarily bad products, but you're forced to use them even when there might be better alternatives. Home Depot is in the process of changing the way it does software development. But that change, for better or worse, is going to take years. In the meantime, you have to work in this weird hybrid environment where everyone's trying to apply Agile development principles to legacy applications that are poorly designed, difficult to maintain, and have virtually no test coverage. So even if you manage to write a few unit tests for your bug fix, you're still reliant on manual QA to verify it because no one knows how the app works but them.",Home Depot

Rampant and Blatant favoritism at all levels. If you are buddies with upper management (friends, church buddies, related etc) You can have a nice salary and nice life working way under the minimum hours required (55). If not one of the chosen few you will be required (forced or ""don't bother coming to work tomorrow"") to work 70-80 hours a week to compensate for the other managers. I was forced to work 90 hours a week, 7 days for almost a year straight until I ended up in the hospital. And don't expect any empathy from upper management/HR. Most hourly associates are allowed to come and go as the please or sit in the breakroom for their entire shift as the managers and people that actually care are running around like crazy picking up the slack. The focus used to be on the customer, it is now whether or not the associates are happy. A new Metric called ACI is what all managers are held to now. It used to be the if the customer was happy. Hence associates are allowed to run wild and treat customers and managers with disrespect and there is nothing we can do unless they are stealing. Quick true story to show the new regime at Home Depot. I was getting screamed at by a customer who had his credit card thrown back at him by an associate that refused to help him. Upper management had me get the customer's info so we can send him a gift card so he wouldn't complain. The next day when I went to write up her termination I was told to go to the training room. They were having a little celebration as the associate who threw the card was getting promoted to Department Supervisor. I kid you not! I almost quit right there but it took two more years of the same type of things happening and me being forced to work 80 hours a week while other managers were working 35-40 for me to finally quit.

I did my orientation that Saturday (the 23rd)... I just recently did my first 5 hour orientation on the computer then an hour training at the cash register on 08/06/2016. 2 weeks went by and that's all I've gotten. I just don't understand that one. I was told that because the schedules had already been made for the following 2 weeks it would be hard to get us put on immediately (which I understood) but it's the 3rd week and I'm not on the schedule. I just don't get that at all so I'll probably receive another 43 dollar check.

The Home Award program in place is a nice incentive because after you reach a certain tier you are able to receive a monetary prize for your awards. There is also the success sharing program which is based off of your store's success during the previous half. With the minimum check being $100 (like $60) after taxes, it is a very small incentive. They also give out customer service all star awards twice a year which comes with a $250 check, which is always a nice boost if you are honored.","Overall, your coworkers make your job. If you don't like (or at least tolerate) the people you are working with, every day will drag by. Being at the service desk, I can confidently tell you that the customers are tough and usually don't care if they treat you like a human being. As far as management goes, I have been severely underwhelmed at both of my locations. The unequal treatment and and standards placed upon employees is baffling. I have seen someone get fired for forgetting to clock out for lunch. I have also seen someone who called out at least 3x a week and was late most others not get fired for years. There is not a set rule for anything at home depot- everything is based off of personal preference and opinion. The training is also sub-par at home depot. There is very little product knowledge training. At the service desk especially associates are expected, by both customers and managers, to have a working knowledge of everything in the store.

Otherwise, this is a good company to work for but some of those in leadership positions; some of the managers, supervisors and team leads, have created a work environment that is full of tension and strife with ritualistic tactics they carry out on a daily basis. It starts at the top and trickles down. Their office politics are a combination of spying on others, brown-nosing, back biting, eaves dropping, gossiping, lying on others and conspiring against those they see as a more qualified and more talented than they. Most of the managers, supervisors and team leads run in cliques and stick together and if one of them don’t like you, they’ll blackball you so that no one else will. The majority of these leaders are very immature, very unprofessional and unqualified to be in their role but the superiors who are largely responsible for promoting such individuals do so as a personal benefit and set out to promote them rather quickly. The environment would remind you a lot of middle-school. On the other hand, if you come to work every day, mind your own business, don’t join cliques, have uncompromising work ethics and carry yourself in a professional manner, more than likely you will be the very one who will be picked apart by your team lead or supervisor on a daily basis about something minuscule. It is common practice that some of the best and brightest people quit soon after they’re hired or end up being fired by one of the leaders who saw them as a personal threat. As you can imagine, the turn-over is very high.

Other than that, it will come down to the ASM's or Store Manager that you deal with. Some care, some don't.","Their HR department is based in Atlanta. Few if any have actual retail experience in the stores they represent and you'll never meet them face to face. If a couple associates decide they want to get you fired because you're their boss and they don't like that you make them work, all they have to do is file a claim that they witnessed you violate a safety policy. Since HR assumes no one would ever fabricate a claim (even when it's the same two people over and over again) they'll side with the accusers and put you on a final. If it happens again within 6 months, you're fired. If you go to the ASM's and/or Store Manger, they will not intervene because then they'll have a target on their back, and the same associates who got you written up could do it to them. This creates an environment where no one can actually ""manage"" anyone. Subsequently, you see a much greater turnover of supervisors than you do sales associates because the latter know they can get away with doing just about whatever they want as long as they show up on time and wear an apron. But as a supervisor (or as an associate who cares about the quality of his work) you'll be constantly frustrated at having to do your work plus the work of others who hide in the breakroom or constantly claim they were helping customers in another part of the store. If you need a job and they offer you one, I'm not saying you shouldn't take it. But be aware that in NC there is no such thing as job security and in certain departments you can't function without being on a forklift. So be prepared to accept whatever associates you have because you will have no power or support to reprimand them. That all comes from HR. They decide and then let the ASM's or Store Manger know what to do... from Atlanta... and with no retail experience.",Home Depot

Managers want the best close to date every night and with limited machines and people it gets rough. Lack of communication between managers and associates. Store manager wants something done so they talk to ASM's. ASM's talk to your supervisor, and then you hear about it from another associate who was there when the supervisor was. 99% of the focus is on sales, 1% is on operations. Awards are almost always sales based with no recognition going to individuals in the department that make sure product is there to sell. Receiving associates do see that kind of reward but the average associate won't see any gratitude for excellent performance making sure that the department is ready for the next day. Schedules are ridiculous as in most retail positions. I work until two hours after close for nearly 3/4 of my weekly hours, usually that means working until midnight. The days I'm not closing I could be coming in as early as 5:00 AM which wrecks my sleep schedule. They won't expect you to close and open one after the other (although it's not unheard of) but being able to work until midnight and being able to work before the sun rises require very different schedules and effect personal life more than it should when you mix them. Promotions are few and far in between. The most promoted people are lot loaders and cashiers, either to sales associate, receiving, or service desk. Mostly a lateral move with a small pay bump.

I don't know yet what the other departments closing responsibilities are but in the paint dept. they are many and time consuming. Recently the store started a 12 day pre- Memorial day sale which included a nice rebate on most of the paints we sell. I was left alone from 8pm until close at 10 pm having to handle customers paint and stain needs while answering questions from other customers. The paint dispenser machines (there are two in this store) require nightly maintenance that includes refilling the colorant reservoirs (16 colors per machine) and cleaning the dispensing nozzles and sponges that keep the nozzles moist so they don't clog. Also all the cardboard collect throughout the shift has to be taken back to the baler along with the garbage and the empty tint bottles. It take at least an hour to complete all these tasks if you can concentrate solely on them, however working alone having to serve customers and being scheduled to leave at 10:00pm when the store closes it's next to impossible to complete all the necessary tasks and get out of there on time. I get up at 5:00 am every day for my day job, which the HR person, who does the staff scheduling, and my DS are fully aware of. The store is very successful, busy and meets it's weekly sales goals regularly. There is no reason not to put an extra person on the help with the work and customer load.

They don't leave store managers in position long enough to be effective, rotating them out of locations every 2-3 years. Store managers are only able to offer a single candidate for promotion opportunities. Promotions are based on politics instead of ability often to people who are completely incapable of performing the duties they are responsible for. The hours are improperly allocated by the corporate office, while they can be altered by the store manager, Atlanta doesn't know or care how scheduling affects customers and employees, often leaving busy or detailed departments unattended for maintenance. The only time anything gets done is the 3 days before a visit from the RVP or one of his direct reports. They want the few employees who work the best to work their fingers to the bone often staying much later than scheduled to correct some issue and later cut their overtime. The store schedule is written by low level management. If they care about their job and ""taking care"" of the associates, some of them are actually good at it. If they are in a hurry or have lost focus they don't concern themselves with employee schedules, Requests off's, holidays, family obligations, or simply work life balance. There is no accountability for the scheduler. They schedule people 10-12 days in a row (perfectly legal as long as it's in a 2 week period) then send you home because they forgot to schedule enough people over night. They approve requests off then schedule you anyway or add request off's that you never put in. If a manager asks you to work a different shift you have to follow-up so that you aren't held accountable. Corporate wants the best customer service each employee can provide. It ends up being an exchange for time when an employee should be addressing maintenance. The employees who service customers get the most recognition while others who have equipment licenses or are more attentive to shelf maintenance are often overlooked and left feeling unappreciated.",Home Depot

I can't count how many misdirected and completely ignorant PM's respond to something with ""this is agile..."" and not actually understand the intent behind agile. So they default to blind metrics which are manipulated to give a a false sense of security and accomplishment. Oh- and management isn't even in touch with current benefits.

If a store does not have enough workers THE STORE WILL NOT BE UP TO STANDARDS. Scolding employees already under stress and working hard will not fix things.

My co-workers were helpful and supportive. I had a flexible schedule and was OK with that.","I worked an average of 39 to 40 hours each week, mostly evenings on a flexible schedule. I felt the store needed more help as serving customers took much time and always seemed that there were other customers waiting for my help. Many times I spent my whole schedule working on my feet with little no breaks. There were times when some customers were seeking items that I had mush difficulty locating, or the lack understanding what customers were looking for. A few customers were very demanding and literally shouted when I didn't serve them or move fast enough for them Most of the time I was alone during a shift and found the work exhausting at the end of the shift. Yes, it was a busy job for part time. The breaking point came when I found out that I was probably being watched by my supervisor in an upstairs security office - it seemed he knew everything I was doing and when. But believe it or not, I was OK with that. One of the issues that led to me leaving Home Depot was one of the managers - who seemed to want me to be on the floor at all times - can't tell you the many times I had to forego lunch and/or coffee breaks. One evening he followed me in the break room, where I was getting ready to eat my sandwich - and he told me that there were a lot of customers on the floor and that if I wanted to take a break or a lunch break, I had better find another sales associate to fill in for me. The store is busy and it seemed that some of the sales associates were never around or too busy - so guess what -- I didn't count on having lunch breaks. (Talk about exhausting). The final breaking point came after the same manager accused me of jamming up a machine after it got jammed . After that, a couple came in looking for a circuit box that felt was on sale - and showed me a photo on their cell phon. I looked it up on the hand held item locator and couldn't find wher it was on sale. We searched all over for it and finally I had to admit I couldn't locate it, so I asked the manager (That's right, the same one), if he could help my find the price and help me help the customers. Oh yes, did I mention that the hand held device I was using battery went out. This manger got indignant and literally scolded me in the front of this couple. He told me to go to the front desk and look it. I had to look up the item number and could not find the sale price they said they had. I asked on of the front desk staff to help, they couldn.t find it either. We spent up to 45 minutes trying to locate the sale price with no luck. I went back to the manager and had the couple show him the price from their phone and could he look up the item and price. He told me that that was my job and walked away. I felt so embarrassed to be scolded in front of the other customers and staff standing close by. I had other run ins with the management, but kept my composure but this was getting be enough for to handle. I found very little support from management and yet the training always encouraged asking for help from management. Like I said, I found more help from other sales staff than from management. I'm not trying to put down management staff as I was management person myself in a previous job. I really expected more from these managerss so in the best interest for myself - I left the store.

Low commission sales position (4-8% on products sold), and on top of that Home Depot eats your commission on most jobs. How you ask? Installers (sub-contractors who don't work for Home Depot) are allowed to add ""miscellaneous labor"" onto every job, this results in what is called a ""mis-spec"" (wrong price), mis-specs come out of your wallet. This is probably the biggest conflict of interest I've ever encountered in any job. Most people, if given the choice, pay themselves more money. Installers are no different...so open up you wallet and never expect full commission on any job. If you do accept this position make sure to watch yourself or else you could end up OWING the company money. What? That's right. Home Depot will take a cut out of every paycheck until you're paid up. You can actually get a negative paycheck. One of my co-workers took out a loan just to do the job. How ridiculous is that? You'd think a multi-billion dollar company that puts so much emphasis on employee equity would behave differently, but this assumption is dead wrong. As long as the stock-numbers are going up, everyone is happy. Except you, of course. You're broke. Pay heed. PASS ON THIS POSITION. Or take it, and be back on the job-hunt in two months.",Home Depot

They tell you when they hire you how much everyone is ""selling"" and what they pay rate is so you assume that equals what the sales people are making. However, they also call a sale something that a customer said yes too but didn't qualify for financing so the deal never completed and the sales person does not get paid on those sales. They tell you the average ticket price is $xK but in reality that's just for 1 of 3 items. Cabinets, Counter-tops and Back-splash closer to $xxxK They promise feedback to help you improve yet never actually take the time. The call center who contacts the customers is rude and act like you work for them. They don't do a good job verifying info or try to understand what the issue is before saying they can't help.

Kitchen designers rude to all outside sales people. Everyone else in HD super sweet except the area you need to be near - the kitchen! You are told during interviewing you are expected to work at HD (for free) for 4 hours a week to self generate leads. The reality is they expect you to work there helping customers and working them over for sales more like 15 hours a week!! (15 hours is stated in actual training material after you're hired on) HD Interior dept tell stores they 'help' the customers while generating leads but they are not focused on helping anyone but themselves. After you make a sale good luck not having an upset disappointed customer. You promise white glove treatment for the overpriced kitchens but in reality they get treated like an average customer for their top dollar spending. You are not advised when the install happens (only promised) so are unable to show up and support your customers as you promised. Constantly had to remind my manager to do his job.

I would say that there's room to advance, but if you have any self-respect, it's just not worth it.","Little to no effort is made in employee retention. After 11 years it is shown to be abundantly clear that most employees are seen as expendable. The only exception is in the specialty departments, most of them can get away with anything because they generate high dollar sales. I've seen a store manager do a happy dance after a Part-Time employee asked him to work with her on her schedule to accommodate a second job. He flat out refused, so she quit and he came over doing a little dance when he told me to take her name off the schedule. People are expected to ""put the needs of the business"" ahead of everything. College kid working for some extra cash to help pay for school or a mother of 3, if Home Depot isn't #1 then your services are no longer required. One of their favorite games is to force people into quitting so they don't have to pay unemployment. I've personally seen that one happen 4 times. Training is a joke. Sure there's plenty of computer classes, but I can't say they're very useful. Most associates are thrown in head first and expected to sink or swim. There's a reason why the guy you asked didn't know the answer to your question, he was never taught. Reasoning for lack of employee discount is that prices are so low that the company can't go any lower, despite competitors having comparable pricing while offering a discount to employees. Years ago employees would get about six 10% off coupons around Christmas time, they were only valid for a short period of time. That was phased out in favor of a $20 gift card. Veteran's Discount doesn't apply to ""commodities"" such as lumber, electrical fittings, most plumbing fittings or items featured in weekly ad. Favoritism is rampant to the degree that the Front End can be struggling to give people bathroom breaks and a person in a sales department is juggling 3 customers, while ""specialists"" sit at a computer browsing the internet right next to a manager that is texting on their phone. Certain people are allowed fixed schedules while others are told that they're required to have 100% availability. Attendance policy is such that one medical emergency or serious illness gets you tossed out the door like an old newspaper. (This is what happened to me. After telling management I was struggling with depression I was fired while in the process of trying to follow HD's guidelines for medical accommodation.) Moving from Part-Time to Full-Time is next to impossible unless you're one of the chosen few. They'll give you close to Full-Time hours for brief periods, but make sure they keep it below the threshold so they don't have to pay for the Full-Time benefits. Managers worry more about making their metrics look good on paper than taking care of customers and employees.

During busy hours, you can end up being the only person in your department if your coworker calls out sick or, in some cases, just not show up, which means you'll have to do twice the work during your shift. There's usually two people working during the closing shift in the paint department. There are sometimes three to four people scheduled for the morning or afternoon shift. There have times when none of coworkers showed up, leaving me by myself to handle long lines of impatient customers. If you are lucky, the ASM can send in someone from another department to help you. Inhaling paint, spray paints, solvents, dust and performing repetitive tasks such as opening paint bucket lids and operating dangerous machinery is not exactly good for your health. The work can be very monotonous, repetitive, and labor intensive. Facing the aisles; making sure all the products are lined up with the packaging facing forward is a very mind-numbing task. You come back home feeling drained and tired. When a customer asks for a product that's supposed to be in aisle, but for some reason, is not there, it can be a real pain to look for it.

The Home Depot makes a point of supporting their staff during times of greatest need. As an example, one of our department supervisors recently suffered a myocardial infarction, which placed him on the disabled list. The remainder of store management rotates in substitution for the stricken supervisor. In my forty-years of government service, I have never witnessed such devotion and dedication to your fellow employees in the public section. I find it unusually right and fitting that the private sector employees at The Home Depot should exhibit this kind of caring for their fellow employees. The Home Depot stores promote from within their own organization, thus allowing each associate to form his/her own career path with the company, if they can stay the course.","The Home Depot’s decision to implement temporary hiring as an institutional requirement for entry, results in lessened monetary compensation for all. Unfortunately, the PPACA (Obamacare) employer mandate for medical benefits makes The Home Depot decision to hire temporary employees first, and eventually transition them to part-time status (etcetera) is understandable, albeit regrettable. This makes the transition to full-time employment a long process, which includes working the unwanted schedules, (e.g. store openings (5-AM) or store closings (11-PM)) for up to twenty-four months with limited hours per week throughout the transition process. These criteria make it all the more difficult for those who want to stay at The Home Depot to remain on staff.

Also in my opinion, the new hire wage increases may be there to offset the potential ObamaCare directive. If/when implemented, ALL part-time employees would be required to have health care coverage. As an example the $200 per month insurance costs would be partially offset by the new wage, keeping Home Depot's wage competitive and able to draw part-timers to work.","A perfect example of the flip side to the 29 hour rule - I was called by another associate to cover his shift.

However on my first day of in-store-training they automatically changed me over to a order puller position that only gets 20 hours a week, they did so without my permission.

Once hired they say you have to wait until you reach past 90 days, and then they tell you that you are not eligible for tuition benefits because you are part-time and only full-time employees are eligible for tuition benefits.

They told me that they would put me on ""full time"" on a temporary basis for 90 days, and then make me permanent if things worked out. If I were to get 40 hours a week, my pay would have been in the ballpark of what they promised me - almost $35K/year. But at Home Depot, ""full time"" means ""at least 30 hours/week"". So right off the bat, given the hours I was scheduled, I was making under $25k, instead of the promised $35k. Then the 90 days came due. I told them that I would like to be made permanent, and my department supervisor was on board. By all accounts, including the weekly ""Associate Effectiveness Report"", I was kicking butt. The store I work in did about $1,500,000.00 more in sales for the year than expected. The company's stock has nearly doubled in the last year. Things should be going great. So what happened? I was made permanent. Permanent Part-Time, that is. My annual compensation is now less than $18k/year. I have none of the benefits that I was told about at my interview. I surmise that the Store Manager who made the promise knew quite well that I would never make what he promised me, nor would i get any of the benefits he bragged about. He lied to my face. And what REALLY kills me is that the schedule is done in a manner which will not allow me to get partial unemployment. In this state, you can get partial unemployment if/when your hours gets cut by more than 1/3. My hours were not cut by 33%. On a rolling average basis (the basis used by the state unemployment office) my hours were cut by 32% compared to the ""full-time"" hours I had worked previously. So now I have my hours cut to half of what I was promised, with pay of half of what I was promised, and I have no ability to get any unemployment. I cannot get Food Stamps because I make too much, but I cannot afford food and rent because I make too little. I cannot get free State health insurance because HD offers (inadequate and illusory) health insurance to part-timers. I cannot afford to buy private health insurance when I cannot even afford a cheap apartment and food. And the health insurance offered to me has an annual cap of $10,000.

9095,"""Progressively got worse""",3.0,"This was a very fast growing company when I began working there in the early 90's. The company had a family atmosphere and I believe everyone put the overall success of the company ahead of their own personal successes (we called it bleeding orange). The feeling was if you did what's best for the company, you would be rewarded down the road. We worked hard, partied hard, and enjoyed the fruits of our labor. We built the vast majority of our systems in house and actively promoted from within. Life was good.","When the founders (Bernie & Arthur) of the company left and Nardelli was brought in from GE to be the new CEO, the culture of the company changed completely. The list is too great for this space but some of the negatives include: outsourcing of IT staff, the replacement of FT store associates with PT folks with no product knowledge. Little to no work/life balance. In general, all processes and operations were overhauled to cut costs and improve efficiencies. Departments at the SSC no longer collaborated, but now competed with one another. Senior management ruled by fear, intimidation and were basically bully's. The GE / Walmart mentality may be good for some, but the culture shift was a complete 180 from where it was when I started. I will say that things started to get better once Blake took over.",Home Depot
9096,"""Terrible""",1.0,"Fellow associates and most of management are amazing individuals to work with. Knowledge of fellow associates is often in-depth and invaluable. As long as you get your work done, no one bothers you. Quite easy to get promoted from being a temp, to being permanent. It is also quite easy to go from one department to another, or to even transfer from one store to another. Fellow associates often have a genuine and deep bond with one another. I also approve of Home Depot's efforts to include Spanish-speaking associates and culture, as well as try to put on do-it-herself workshops or children's workshops. They also seem willing to donate to schools and community events upon asking.","Favoritism, nepotism, and disorganized and apathetic upper-management. Are not open to working with associates who have children, or are going to school, have associate or personal conflicts, or have medical needs. I've heard it all, and I do not hear of good support. The swing-shift schedules are within legal bounds (8 hours between shifts), but very unhealthy. Very little employee benefits (no employee discounts, ect). ""Success-sharing"" scheme is mostly a joke, and seems to encourage management to cut hours to meet sales goals. It is very very very difficult to get promoted to 'full-time' through hard work, knowledge, or personality. No small amount of kissing-up is required. The pay is determined during your first interview. Raises and equality of pay is completely unbalanced. Some people get paid lots to do very little, and some get paid very little and do lots.

They wouldn't hire me unless i took a 5$ pay cut so i told them that i wouldn't use what i know from my electrical work. Thinking they would maybe give me more $ but know they said that is fine you just have to show them where stuff is and stock the shelf. * Most females start out making more then men dont ask me why ask the people they just hired with no product knowledge or even home improvement knowledge. * They promise a lot like how people move up in the company real fast BS they will find someone they like for the higher up position hire them as just a regular associate 3 -4 months later they moved them up. * No real pay raise i have asked 3 times for a raise nothing did get my .25 cent raise after my first year. They say they don't give raises and that we should think of are success sharing every 6 months as are raise. Maybe i would think of it as a raise if i was a manager or corporate getting anywhere from $20k as a manager or corporate making a million/millions for my success sharing every 6 months. * Management is just not right they will only put you down and tell you what you have done wrong.

Working on the MET team was nice because it was a different environment each day. For me, I like to interact with people so I also enjoyed the opportunity to assist customers.","Just as all companies have those employees who still think they are in high school, so does The Home Depot. I was the senior employee of the MET Team and was going to be assigned a store close to my home and because of my above average evaluations was scheduled to receive a nice raise this year. I never received any type of disciplinary action during the eight years employed there. A co-worker anonymously called the awareness hotline on me and the third party vendor did a telephone investigation of the complaint asking if I had ever threatened anyone or spoke down to my peers in a way that made them feel intimidated. I told them I hadn't and the story was completely bogus and my file spoke for itself. I also requested they speak to my manager and ask him directly because he and I had a great working rapport. Instead, they interviewed only 3 members of a 20 member team (why it was these three I don't know - they did not interview my manager or the people I worked one on one with daily) Evidently, the complaints made through the awareness hotline happen frequently and most are documented unless gross misconduct is proven. I really thought I had nothing to worry about. But, the next day I was terminated and I was never given a detailed description of the allegation, only that I was found to have violated The Home Depot's harassment policy. When the company who conducts the investigations becomes involved, management and local HR representatives are not involved. All decisions are based on the the vendor. So, it didn't matter what my district manager had to say, or the fact that I had perfect evaluations for the last 3 years, and absolutely no progressive discipline on file. I filed unemployment and received it because the unemployment office determined I was not terminated for just cause. I have a family of three children and to have this happen completely expectantly was devastating. I wish they would address these allegations in a different manner. Employees should have the right to defend themselves from their accusers. I didn't even know what I was supposed to be defending myself from.

Potential to expand your knowledge and experience available if you choose to do so. Large workplace and associates are great.,"Still sexist, not that they admit it, but generally men will be paid more per hour than women in the same position. It is not acceptable for associates to discuss wages with their co-workers, but they do. And I know women that had been associates for 3+ years and find out that the newly hired, non experienced male in the same department was hired at a payrate that already exceeded hers! But she can't use that knowledge in negotiations because she isn't supposed to know. It's horrible. Also, advancing from team member to any department head position is difficult due to favoritism. Most department heads didn't get there because they were wonderful employees, but because they are mindless butt kissers. So this creates a ridiculous senario of mostly idiots running things. Management doesn't even try to hide this behavior, thus causing the associates that are actually deserving of advancement and dedicated knowledgable workers to get frustrated and eventually quit. If you work hard and are good on the sales floor don't expect to advance. **I have been told this varies from store to store, but ultimately, if corporate accepts the behavior from the Store Managers, and they obviously do, then it happens more often than not. And most department heads do not know anything about the department they are running and are told ""delegation"" is what is expected from them. So they pawn all their paperwork off on the associates in their departments and take all the credit for it. Usually they hang in their manager cliques during the workday and spend time gossiping, etc. My favorite supervisers were the few that would teach by example and work with their team. Unfortunately managers see that as weak and not driven to lead. So backwards! Terrible pay and annual raises are insulting. No employee discounts in the store. And most Managers favorite thing to say to associates is ""you should be grateful you have a job."" Full time employees MUST have open availability and only a handful of them have set schedules. Infact corporate has elimainated almost all positions where the hours regular week to week historically and tweeked them just enough to change them also. It doesn't make sense, the only reason must be a control issue, because it certainly doesn't make veteran associates happy. Unfortunately the days of Home Depot being all about the customer & the associates are long gone.

You mostly work without too much supervision and you are generally free to go to the restroom and drink water when you please. Potentially lose weight and build muscle while working.","Cons... where do I begin. First off at this store you make $8.50 an hour. Before it used to be $12.50 but now it is $8.50 and there is absolutely no negotiating. The hours for part-time are Midnight to 6am Tuesday through Saturday. Chances are you will stay awake during those hours on your days off because your body will be used to it. You are constantly changing your sleeping schedule and therefore always tired or sleepy. Very few times everyone finishes early and you get to leave sooner but usually you can always help someone else and leave around 6:30 to 7 AM. Secondly the work is brutal especially when you first start, you basically get pallets of merchandise and put them where they go. The full time people usually get the same (easier) departments every day. The new part-timers get sent where ever is needed but usually do the more annoying work that nobody likes doing. They usually put you in paint right after starting which is possibly the hardest and most annoying department to work in. You are constantly picking a cardboard container of 4 1gallon paints can and putting them on the aisles which is a paint because the cardboard container is flimsy, and when ever you push merchandise back everything gets stuck and becomes a pain in the rear. You also have to move around the big 5 gallon cans but those are not too bad. I'm a pretty fit person and it's not that the things are heavy it's just that its just annoying to repeatedly do the work nobody wants to do, in massive quantities, for such little pay. Ultimately you feel like you are busting your ass for nothing, you could be making just as much money doing a job that is a lot easier and at least work a normal. The people joke around a lot which might sometimes be annoying considering your working over night.

With enough time anybody can become a professional by working with these company training sources, contractors (customers), and hands on company products. * Potential for long term management growth and development - while landing a management position is extremely difficult, Home Depot develops extremely strong managers that have an extremely high understanding of basic and even moderate levels of business management, and finance. I myself learned more at work about business than I did in college. If you're willing to learn, and partly due to extreme micro managing (which in this sense is a good thing) anybody can grow to be an amazing manager. However if you don't put in the appropriate time and effort you will not prosper with the company.","* Completely incompetent managers at all levels - this is probably the biggest con with the company. I have worked at several places in my career and no job is perfect but Home Depot has got to have the most incompetent managers across the board. The only reason these ""managers"" keep their job is because they play the ""buddy system"" and CYOA (cover your own a$$). Basically if you're not on the in crowd then you're on the out crowd meaning a potential target for harassment and termination. I've seen it time and time again, and even myself have been forcefully apart of this completely unethical, and unmoral business practice. THIS MUST STOP!!! Staff walks around with no trust in upper management and in either general fear of their jobs, or feeling so beat down that they could care less if fired. This is a problem that must be fixed. * Extremely poor compensation compared to companies past - Home Depot used to be the gold standard for compensation. Back when minimum pay waws $5.50 an hour Home Depot started at 8-12 dollars an hour and specialist were adequately compensated for their skills grossing in $20 an hour. Now the pay is a joke, Home Depot offers new hires as little as possible with work loads mountains high. New employees generally don't care about their jobs, or customers cause Home Depot has become just that ""a job"" it's no longer a ""career"". * Little to no ability for promotion due to stagnation in the company - gone are the days of being able to be a top performer with the ability to be promoted to Store manager within 5-10 years. Now it takes 5-10 years just to make a lowly department manager, let alone assistant or store manager. The company is stagnent with little to no opportunity for growth. Those that are promoted are usually promoted due to the ""buddy system"" rather than due to actual performance. THIS NEEDS TO STOP!!! Too many hard working, extremely intelligent people are being passed over for incompetent kiss butts that have ZERO leadership skills, and even worse management skills. Ever notice how bad customer service is or how bad stores look compared to your top competitor Lowes, having worked for both companies I can attest that Lowes, while not perfect, has a much better mindset in this area and doesn't allow incompetent managers.

One hour a day for designated for each but I was only scheduled for 4-6 hours because they had a budget cut. The rest of the time was usually spent on the floor taking questions for all departments, locating merchandise, pulling merchandise, calling vendors to locate lost merchandise, and catching up on training for the job I rarely did. When I attempted to check the emails for the Design Center I was approached by the Store Manager. Later it was put on my review that I was pretending to work without so much a question about what my motives were. I was reprimanded for using the computer too much... As a Kitchen Designer training on 2020. They placed a majority of the store on Probation called PIP all at once. Most of the people in my local store quit while on probation and the rest were fired causing a mass hiring of new employees. I've never been so humiliated by managers. It was the first job where I was was completely dissatisfied. The customer first policy only go went far to get someone to spend money. Nothing was done to follow up on orders, the time needed to build a customer relationship with those people was not there. About 60% of the calls I took per day was dissatisfied customers.

This is not only very demoralizing but probably detrimental to the business, since the consultants incentives are not strictly aligned with the company's goals. * the mentality was ""we are all super busy all the time and have to work all hours"", even though it wasn't really accomplishing anything. Very much ""look busy for the sake of looking busy"", which not only will burn out your employees, but also makes them feel useless since the overtime work doesn't go anywhere. * vacation, time off, benefits all suck: 2 weeks of vacation is new college-hire level, plus there were only 6 national holidays (par for the course in retail, but still crappy). Health insurance was crazy expensive for such a large self-insured company, and they won't cover spouses if they work for a company that offers health insurance--this left some new hires' spouses without coverage because it wasn't during their open enrollment and couldn't get on their employers' plan right away.

Employer does a very good job of empowering associates to resolve customer issues with discounts and value added services without management approval. P/T associates do have access to a minimal benefit package with some nice options. This includes employer match 401k, and a minimal medical insurance plan among other things. Some minimal advancement and training potential does exist - all based on starting pay rate. One can define days of the week and times available for work. This is good for retired and students. Monthly meetings (at 5AM!) with lots of ""RA RA"" ""go team talk"" and snacks if you like that sort of thing. An hourly employee can rise through the ranks to department head, then to assistant store manager, etc. There is a ""home Depot University for management possitions.

For those associates looking for maximum possible hours including older full time associates - little if any attempt is made to define a regular work schedule with reasonable hours. Many examples of single parents with a different schedule every week and hours ranging from 5am to 11pm. No realistic carreer potential these days as all advancement is based on starting wage rate. Example: Start wage for P/T cashier is $8.50. Start wage rate for Electrical/Plumbing/flooring sales associate is $10.20. After a year with the company a cashier manages to move up to a sales possition. That indevidual doesn't get the sales pay rate promotion. Pay raises are annual events and ammount to 3 or 5 cents per hour, at best. But, if one moves from night shift stocking duties to daytime cashier - they certainly will lower the pay from 10.20 to 8.50 - that you can count on. Very Top down management style. There is a great deal of emphasis placed on the value of employees towards business success in management presentations and training, however employees have no input into what is stocked, or how it is marketed, or how it is priced, or how it is shelved. Employees can be and are regularly terminated for minor infractions and deviations from corporate written pollicy. Although these policies are available online to the employees - many of the firing offenses are not explained to the employee durring orientation or ongoing training. Examples that have occurred in my first year include: even a minor atempt to confront a shoplifter. Annother was when an employee was clocked out after store hours; the associate waits twenty minutes after calling for a manager to unlock the door; in frustration the associate walks out the open rollup door where a fork lift and several people are working.

10216,"""Thoughts of former sales associate moving into a corporate role w/ another retailer""",3.0,"There are a couple of things that Home Depot does better than other national retailers. To start, there is legitimate room for growth at the store level. You don't need a college degree to get promoted into the managerial levels within the store. The supervisor of my department had never set foot in a college class room and was making about $40,000 a year plus benefits – a modest salary if you’re just graduating college, but a really good one if you’re lacking a degree. The Assistant Store Managers (ASM) made anywhere from $50k to over $60K I believe, and often they did not have any kind of college education either. While I strongly believe in education (I myself am a military veteran who used my education benefits to finish my bachelor's degree), there are two good reasons why it’s a good idea to promote store managers from the ‘enlisted’ ranks of non-degree workers, so to speak. First, a retail environment can quickly wear a person out. If the regular store workers have no prospects for growth, there is little incentive for them to work hard or stick around with the company. The quality, morale, and pride of the workers will quickly drop if they don’t have a proverbial carrot on a stick to chase, or more simply a feeling of recognition. Many of the people I worked with at Home Depot have been with the company for years: the store had a great sense of team spirit and pride, and the location was very well managed by long time HD employees. This leads into the second reason why Home Depot’s in-store promotion methods work well: the best retail managers are often the most experienced. Another major retailer could learn from Home Depot in this sense. That company currently has a policy of essentially requiring all store executives (basically the equivalent of assistant managers) to have a college degree. There are a lot of complaints about that company's stores essentially being run by college kids at their first real job without any real leadership abilities or managerial skills. The managers and supervisors at the Home Depot store I worked in were competent and worked their way into the position for the most part. The second area where Home Depot really differentiates itself is in the emphasis on directly approaching customers. A lot of the sales associates are people with some kind of contracting, construction, or trade experience and so they are able to more often than not point customers in the right direction and give advice on projects. The constant customer contact is one of the big draws for many of the shoppers, especially those who have little to no experience with home improvement and repair. It’s surprising, but just about every time I approached a customer and asked them if they needed any help, they usually did. It seems like it would be common sense, but other major retailers could stand to focus more on customer interaction and being sociable with the store guests.","Now to the negatives. There is the general ‘retail suck’ of dealing with customers and then there is dealing with customers at Home Depot. If you are not an expert in the products in your department, you should be prepared to be abused. The customers are a strange mix of weather-beaten contractors with very specific and demanding needs, to rich soccer moms that have never touched a tool in their life but have it set in their mind that they want to build a tree house by themselves for their kids and not only want you to tell them exactly what they need to do this, but to tell them how to do it as well. There are literally tens of thousands of different products in the store and it is easy to get overwhelmed just by questions of where things are. But customers also expect that each sales associate is an expert in home improvement and repair. To be fair, many of the sales associates were very knowledgeable from years of experience. But there were also plenty of people like me who were not. Home Depot’s training program was generally relegated to the standard safety videos on a computer along with a few product knowledge videos that were whole inadequate. I was tossed to the wolves to learn the products on the fly and it’s really a difficult process. When someone is looking for recommendations on which $200 power tool to buy, they’re not very understanding when you tell them you’re not sure which tools is the best one for their situation. There really needs to be a lot more hands-on product training and/or live demonstrations. There wasn’t a single training session like this at any point while I worked in the store and I had to rely on the other more knowledgeable employees to help me out over the radio. There is also a general ‘retail suck’ of keeping shelves stocked and then there is keeping shelves stocked at Home Depot. I suppose it might appear to be efficient on paper, but keeping all the inventory stored high above the sales floor is a huge time-suck and plainly gets in the way of interacting with customers. There were countless times where it took me all day to try and get an item down with a forklift and I had to keep stopping what I was doing because customers kept hitting the help buttons in my department. If the stores had more of a back warehouse component to them, the stores would be far more operationally efficient and would be less cluttered and full of ‘holes’ on the shelves. It doesn’t help that HD’s inventory system and general store technology are outdated and inefficient. I don’t recommend working for Home Depot at the store level if you aren’t already an expert in home improvement and repair and if you cannot handle conflicts with customers – not until HD improves their training, or you will risk feeling like a snake oil salesman peddling products you don’t really understand. There are some nastier customer conflicts at Home Depot than at a regular retailer because of the relatively higher prices of the products and because customers have an extremely high expectation of the expertise of the sales employees.",Home Depot

We all smile, laugh and greet each other in passing. All Home Depot Associates will stop whatever they are doing to lend a hand to, not only a customer but to other Associates as well. And that is really important. Management is very talented at keeping employees happy and makes the shift a pleasurable one. It almost feels like a family. Managers as well as Employees, bring in food to share, leave coupons for discounts on food and leave a wide range of literature in the breakroom for all to share. When someone has a life issue, Associates will come together to try and help that Employee. For instance, last week one of the Employees had a death in the family and needed money for the funeral. Home Depot said they would match all donations and Everyone put what they could into the fund. This type of Attitude is why I really like my job. Everyone looks out for each other. One other thing I like is helping the Customers. I love problem solving and boy do they have them! Even though I'm stocking, I am consistently asked where something in the store is.

Constantly picking upwards of 100 pounds and miles of walking from the receiving area throughout the store is quite a workout. I go home every night exausted! As a Professional Framer (lack of work) I compare the physical labor as the same, yet at half the pay. One other issue I have as a Freight Team Associate. The harder you work, the less pay you recieve! It really doesn't make sense...

We are also expected to handle a lot of customer issues and operational tasks. Job titles are not rigidly constrained, so there are lots of opportunities to step up and learn new things.","There is a tremendous amount of work to be done each day, with fewer people to do it and less time to do it in. Occasionally Store Support will announce they are going to slow down the ad-sets or endcap merchandising so everyone can spend more time helping customers, but within a few weeks merchandising tasks start creeping back into the weekly playbook and pretty soon it seems like you're doing more than before. As a DS, we also have a lot of reports to work each week, and these suffer the same kind of creep. We're still scheduled to cover our departments most of the week, and tasking is restricted during Power Hours (10am to 2pm) and weekends , so when you do finally get a chance to get something done, you just have to put your head down, ignore everything around you, and power through it.",Home Depot

After being with Home Depot for six months they gave the department supervisors another ""opportunity"" which was taking on more work doing all the purchasing for your departments. Many different instances when the management and I were in confrontations because we had a disagreement. Packdown is a word anyone working for Home Depot will come to hate. This is the process of a list of products that have to be brought down from the upper shelves when they have sold out. Problem with this is that most of the time the department supervisor will be griped out for this not getting done. You are supposed to rely on your associates that are subordinates to finish this on your days off or before you come in for the day. If this task is not finished again dept sup's are the one taking the heat. Lastly, there are many more reports to finish on a weekly basis that along with waiting on customers, packdown, and not having enough employees because of labor being too high, are impossible to finish.

Some of the new policies I've seen have really made it easier on the associates in that they are now actually allowing us to do our job. When the customer is satisfied, the associate experiences less of the stress that such an environment seems to naturally bring. The pay isn't spectacular, but is probably better than most retail jobs. All the usual benefits, 401k, health, dental, etc. They aren't impressive, but the fact that they are available to part timers as well makes them worth the while for the more casual employee. Co-workers sometimes make for a fun work environment. Other co-workers, not so much. Great place for those that like to avoid the sedentary lifestyle.","I've found promotional oppurtunities to be disappointing. It seems that the people I've seen promoted to DH and sometimes even ASM were given the positions for reasons other than performance (seniority, AA/EEO,favoritism,etc.). Salary increase at the hourly level upon promotion to a DH position is unimpressive (though this may just be in my area). Again, perhaps this is just in my district, but they try to sell you on a DH position as being just a stepping stone to a salaried ASM position. Those not interested in such a long term commitment to the company are out of luck with a low wage increase compared to the workload. There's almost no reason to accept a DH spot unless you really want a career with Home Depot. Occassionally highly stressful with fewer employees, yet the same number of customers.

Job security in this market would rate as better than average if you're in core operations.","While Frank Blake has made some profoundly positive changes, there still appear to be severe disconnects at the field levels.

That's very true at THD - there are some very good leaders there, and if you happen to be part of that, be thankful and supportive. However, best-in-class companies don't typically espouse that view.

No training otherwise for anyone regardless if you are a woman or a man. You literally have to go away from the company to learn how thei company owrks. Look higher in their organization and you will see very few female Sales Managers and maybe one token female Operations manager.

The initial high salary opportunity upon getting hired is generous.,"Home Depot has a very disjointed senior leadership team that changes priorities faster than the wind changes direction. Employees that execute these ""on a whim"" plans are set up to fail because there is not enough working processes and cross organizational cooperation. Even if you are able to complete the projects you are tasked with, there is a very high chance it will not be used or implemented (due to a changing priority or there isn't any money or people to make it happen). The systems are outdated and only a few know how to extract information out of them. Training has been slashed, so the only way to learn how to do your job is to learn from kind coworkers. The culture is very cut-throat so good luck on getting any training from your counterparts. The office politics are unreal - no matter your skill level, you have to be able to back stab and politic because your promotions depend on it. Many are promoted who do not have the skills necessary to be in that position. The Nardelli management style (run the employees into the ground) is still very alive in this organization. The work hours are 10-12 hour days and weekends for less pay as people in consulting or similar type work. Individuals are set up by the group leaders to compete with one another rather than working as a team to get results. People are out for themselves and do not work together. The sign-on stock bonus is generous, but it is not yours until you have stayed with the company for 5 years. Most people do not last this long there.

The company has changed a lot in the time I have been with them. The job security is there even though they now like to dangle it over your head and make you keep running on the little wheel. The secured stock offered to store managers and above is a great benefit, if the leaders of the company could every figure out what Wall St. is looking for and get that stock to gain value.","In the last 7 years the amount of square footage that a Home Depot sales associate has had to cover has increased by over 200%. The company continues to cut hours from the floor. In addition to the normal daily issues created by not having the neccessary staff to run a store the size of an orange box the company drills their managers constantly on customer service metrics that in fact they are driving down with years of poor decision making. Home Depot was, when I started, a customer service, sales based company. At this point the company is all about metrics. It all started with the decision to put an unproven, and in my opinion, unqualified CEO in charge of the company. The customer service/ taking care of our people culture that we had all grown up with disappeared. In it's place was a culture of making a number just for the sake of making a number. The company's new found focus on top line sales, which has nothing to do with being profitable and creating shareholder value, only shows that this is still the case. In addition to the stores being grossly understaffed, as voiced not only by our managers, but also by our customers the company has made it extremely difficult to order the product that is needed to take care of the customers. When I started with the company we did all of our own ordering. Everything that a customer had the opportunity to buy was ordered by someone in that store. Someone who was there with the customers every day and knew what their customers wanted and what would sell. This system was replaced because, ""it created inventory imbalances"". This system was replaced with several systems. One of which orders merchandise based off of what the computer thinks you need and will bump up an order to as much as 10 weeks of supply if it can make the minimum and stay within the guidelines. Another system creates orders based off a preset weeks of supply, and you as a store manager do not get to set that predetermined number. Yet another system is in place so home office can do blanket orders to cover seasonal and advertisement items. The problem with this is that it groups over 2200 stores into just 4 volume groups and doesn't take into account what the season is or what a particular store sells. As a store manager you have the ability to order about 25% of your active sku's without jumping through hoops to do so. All of the systems that were put in place to give the company more control over our inventories have created more imbalances that experienced, engaged associates ever did. Physical inventory is another issue. As a Home Depot store manager you only have vision to your perpetual inventory, or what is in you store computer. You have no vision into what your book inventory is until after you complete your yearly inventory. In addition Home Depot uses an old antiquated system of keeping inventory. We are the only retailer to my knowledge that inventories based on retail instead of cost. This creates multiple issues. One, you have to have individuals that could be used for sales and service to physically do price changes. This is something that all other retailers figured out years ago. Instead of having to physically count everything every time there is a price change, companies like Wal Mart do a manual price change in the system and all the associate has to do is change the labels. Incorrect price changes cost Home Depot more in shrink every year than theft. Another down side to working at Home Depot is the fact that the company was founded on the ""good ole boy"" system and remains that way today. We've all heard the stories of high ranking officers of the company starting out as a lot tech. I'm not taking anything away from those individuals but maybe a former lot tech isn't the best person to lead a multi billion dollar retailer. The bonus structure has been reformatted to give the company the ability to change your sales plan in the middle of the year to ""give more store managers the opportunity to make a bonus"". The fact is I haven't seen that. What I have seen is managers that made their goal for the first half of the year having their sales plans jacked up so they couldn't make it the second half. I call this the Katrina rule. Too many managers bonused in the wake of the storm. The company had to do something to control the expense. There is very little appreciation for a job well done with this company as a store manager. In fact my only motivation at this point seems to be, ""I don't want to get fired"". This company has forgotten how to treat their salaried managers. We are beaten into submission over taking care of our people but the company fails to take care of us. I guess anyone can see the irony there. The fact is that a salaried position with this company is a constant source of stress and dissapointment for anyone that truly wants to succeed. If you are just looking for a pay check (a pay check that isn't equal to what a store manager at Toys R Us makes) and you are really good at putting up with a constant beating and not really good at figuring out that things don't make sense this is the job for you. In fact the company's recruiting tag line should be, ""Creative? Driven to succeed? Need not apply, all yes men welcome!"".

And we don't smell like cooking grease at the end of the day.,"Downsides include (but are not limited to) a severe lack of coverage on the floor. Often one associate will be covering up to four or five departments all by themselves because either no one was scheduled in a particular department or because multiple people went to lunch at the same time. Going to lunch at the same time would not be such a problem if there were more than one person scheduled to a department at a time. Associates are supposed to find someone to cover their department when they go to breaks or lunch, but most times they do not. Management does not enforce this policy. Management also rarely make an appearance to help out on the floor when there is no other help. We who call management as a final attempt to find help for a customer often have our concerns brushed off, and are told to keep calling around to try and find someone else to help. It takes, at bare minimum, eight cashiers (aside from their immediate supervisors) working a full shift each to smoothly run the registers, and cover eachother's breaks. Many times there will be scheduled only five or six cashiers and two or three of them will only be for a half shift. Management does not open a register when there are lines, but they are quick to call the cashier supervisor and complain. There is a deplorable lack of communication. Rarely do any two people in a given department have the same set of instructions as to what needs to be done for the day. However management is ready to chastise when things are not done according to ""specifications."" Specifications that are at times not given at all. Each manager has their own set of rules. In order to get along for the day, associates need to know which manager(s) are present, and which rules apply to which manager. Managers chastise associates for not following their rules even if the associate was following a different manager's rules. Following the rules of the store manager does not exempt one from trouble. Associates who seem to spend all their time in the break room or simply are rude and/or uncooperative can escape diciplinary actions if they are ""buddies"" with management.

If we ask for a Saturday or Sunday off for a family commitment, (which they give us) we are scheduled the following week to work 10 days straight with no break. This is their dysfuntional ""payback"". Also, this can be a dangerous place to work, especially garden. Since the garden areas are outside, the dust from fertilizers blows into the nostrils of the cashiers and associates moving these bags from pallet to shelf.

Urgent need for a fully functioning HR Section with staff that have knowledge of employment law. HR has no authority with decisions left to managers without the necessary experience or knowledge when things go wrong. * Performance culture (Yr End Review) based on who you know rather than on results. Managers too blinded by personality rather than on delivery. Poor performance ignored.Management never accepts responsibility for failings or puts things right. * To move posts you either have to apply externally or leave with management often interfering in applications to stop people moving. For some staff, the issues are such that it can affect mental health through the inability to move posts quickly or not at all. Lack of duty of care shown in all levels throughout the organisation. Your success is based on the quality of your management and under Transformation, you no longer have the ability to move to get out of situations. * Promotion is almost impossible to achieve in lower grades especially in Finance and Project Controls with only 10% salary increase offered. Lower starting salaries since Transformation. Ability to earn more is based on Management offering you and recognising work which exceeds objectives (rare). Very common to be expected to take on work at higher grades with DE&amp;S failing to pay deputising allowance. Continual history of broken promises from management. * Continual drive to recruit from outside and ignore talent within the organisation * Better opportunities in Project Management and Commercial than in Cost Control or Finance (poorly managed) * Culture of middle management bearing down on lower staff, imposing unreasonable workloads and expecting staff to work whilst on leave, weekends or evenings whilst the management has a life. Difficult to take leave. * Since 2016, blame culture is common practice where management fails to respond to feedback. Working relationships with other functions can be strained to the point at which processes fail to function effectively. No support from management in many cases. * Parking onsite and commuting is an issue. * Not an inclusive culture - disabled staff in particular tend to have a poor experience where managers cannot be bothered to service or respect reasonable adjustments. Often witnessed staff excluded from activities *Lack of on the job training - you have to train yourself and don't expect help from others.

And the supervisors have no training or supervisory skills. They get the job by being the one associate that didnt quit in the first 3 months. I had given my notice and ended up walked off the job early after repeatedly coming on shift to find my section in a shambles because the associate before me had done nothing all day and my supervisor doing nothing about it.

Hours vary a lot week to week--you can get nearly 30 hours one week & then the next week, you might get 8. Speaking of hours, it seems like there are usually 1 or 2 times a week where you close & have to open up the next morning which stinks. Sometimes departments are understaffed or hours get cut depending on how business is--usually employees will leave if they've got overtime or if they just feel like cutting out early, but if you're asked by management as a temp/seasonal employee, then you don't have a choice.

This is horrible if you want to try to go to school to get a degree or want to spend time with your friends or loved ones. - Managers would give promotions to employees who had been there less time and knew less because those people would brown nose the managers for a promotion then once they got the promotion they just stopped brown nosing. - Alot of managers are used to having employees do reports and work for them so they dont really know how much of the business or day to day operations of the store really work which causes them to have unrealistic expectations. - Some managers refuse to work with employees when the employees need something in order to complete a project that the managers would assign to them. Sometimes managers would assign me a huge project that would take really long to complete on my own and when I ask if I could get a couple of people to help me out the manager would give me only one person who would usually be a part timer who didnt really want to help me with the project to begin with. - Some of the managers would make you feel guilty about calling in sick when your not feeling well and would try to convince employees to come in to work and go home after a few hours if their still not feeling well. - The managers dont really acknowledge alot of the things people do throughout the year for when it comes time to write employee evaluations, they would forget things that employees did to help them out and the company and only write stuff in the employee evaluations that happened when they had to come up with stuff to write on the 6 month evaluations for employees. The managers would only start to notice the stuff you did around the time that it was to write the evaluations when they start to observe the employees. - Managers and Supervisors arent permitted to give excellent ratings in all fields of employee evaluations because they feel its being too generous. This causes them to give an average rating to most of the employees who dont brown nose them, even if you try to argue with them and tell them why you dont agree with their evaluation they wont change more then 1-2 things in the evaluation. - Most of the pay raises that happen once a year will be anywhere from $0.10 to $0.50 for non-supervisor level employees, that isnt what I call a raise its adjusting for inflation (and not even that since inflation is getting crazy lately). - Supervisors receive double bonuses when it comes time to receive a bonus and Assistant managers and managers receive even bigger bonuses. Depending on the sales that the store makes some assistant managers receive bonuses of $10,000+ while regular employees might make $300-$600. - Most of the positions that they hire for are part time so that they can cut hours from the part time workers when sales are low. - Cashiers are required to greet each customer that passes by them, open boxes for expensive products to inspect them for hidden items (which I think is rude to do if the customer is coming to pay for the items), ask customers if they want to apply for a credit card, ask customers to participate in the online survey, try to sell customers the ""product of the month"", scan all the products under a certain amount of time, check id for each customer, and many other things that really make the job not enjoyable with all the rules that employees have to follow.

I'm rather detailed-oriented so making sure prices are correct and that product is in the right spot is nice.","My biggest issue is with the MET team. They do all of the bay resets and merchandising and such, and we always clash. The BIAs have these mobile carts where the price tags print from, and on them we have our supplies, like tape, scissors, wobblers, etc. The MET team members, when they need any of these supplies, instead of going to the supply closet or the sign bay, they just take stuff from our carts without asking. It got so bad I had to put my supplies in my locker when I'm not working. They also sometimes don't sequence the bays after they've reset them, or they do but don't change the tags. I understand that they have a limited window to do their work, but not sequencing the bays at the very least makes my job harder. And I've talked to them as well as my managers, but nothing has been done. Now it's so bad that I always dread the day of the week when they come in. Some of the department heads make my job tough as well. In one department, the head always closes packdowns I open without putting the product on the shelf.

You also get a store assigned to you and in the store there is also a lead generator. You get to roam the store and ask people if the would like a free estimate for Windows, Gutters, Insulation, roofing, and siding, Unfortunately the majority of people at home depot are contrators and the common folk have been asked so many times for a free estimate they see you coming. Since its commission only you work the store for free. The paid lead generator at your store can assist you with leads but they are usually for one window, a repair or for customers that just want the bottom line quote to compare you to others or do it themselves. No compensation for milage you drive to the store or to appointments and YOU pay it all out of pocket with your commission money. MONTHLY QUOTA: You must hit $98,000 in four weeks or $115,000 in five weeks to get the 5K monthly bonus. Only a few people per team get enough leads and sales to qualify for this bonus. Only about five people in the whole company will qualify for this bonus selling windows only. Fact is you need to sell big ticket items like siding and windows to really generate the bigger dollars to make your monthly quota to qualify for the big money your told about. Lets say you do sell a whole house of windows... good job..... but then you better hope that your field inspector who measures the job again after you have sold it measures it correctly and orders the correct sized windows for the install day. OH, If you miss measure work or he finds something you missed you have to go back and explain the increase and get them to sign off on it to complete the job. Otherwise bye bye commission. If the installer you have been assigned loses the paperwork or doesn't show up on time for an appointment your the one that takes the heat. Installers can ruin almost every sale you make and they rarely read the required detailed reports and diagrams you submit. again a waste of time. Be prepared to sit for three hours doing the full presentation and paperwork. Lugging windows around all day in the heat of summer is a treat.

I've had more than two dozen extremely happy customers send letters and e-mails praising my great customer service and never once--NEVER IN FIVE YEARS--has my manager or anyone higher in the company said ""Good Job"" for customer service. I grew sales in one class of merchandise from under a million a year to more than $1.8 million through careful purchasing and effective merchandising and then I am chastised for being ""infatuated"" with that product class. Xqqqqqs me! I could make it $2 million or more if they would give me the floorspace, but instead they keep shrinking the space for these items. No doubt in a few months when sales have dropped they'll rake me over the coals again for not meeting sales goals. Give me a break! They claim that ""taking care of people,"" i.e., associates, is a core value of the company but their actions do not back up that claim. The focus is always on the negative and what is wrong or could be better and never on what is good. I am an Assistant Manager. The company has an award program ""Homer Award"" to recognize performance above and beyond expectations. Up until a year or so ago at least one ASM in my store was recognized monthly . Since then (14 months passed) not one Homer Award has been given to an ASM. This is not because we are not performing, but because the store manager(s) could not care less.

Can move frome dept to dept","Home Depot treats you as a number. Management does not have the time to get to know you. Also, raises are very bias. Your manager will decide alone if you deserve one after 1 year.",Home Depot
11820,"""DON'T!!!!""",1.0,Originally thought because it was a big company they would treat people fairly. The stores are mostly okay but RSW is a joke.,"They treat most sales people like slaves. The RSW sales people are managed by browbeating and intimidation. Nothing you do is ever good enough. ""Flogging will continue until morale improves"" mentality. They have an exceptionally hight turnover rate because of the way they treat people, and make outrageous statements to get you to come onboard. Lots of driving mileage. They pay for nothing except base training and expect you to do everything else for free - or else! It takes awhile just to make enough money to go to a fast food restaurant!",Home Depot
11821,"""Run to Lowes""",2.0,Helping customers find things they need to fix up there house. Very flexible work schedule. Not very busy. Easy work load.,Employees are not trained on products. Not enough employees to satisfy customer needs. Need more qualified employees. Upper management cut all pays to all jobs.,Home Depot
11822,"""Once enjoyed this company....""",3.0,The values are really good at this company..they work really hard to please their associates...but i have realized that all depends on which store you work at...this is my second store and it compares nothing to the first store i worked at.. ..offer lots of rewards and bonuses towards certain goals... ..overall a fair and easy company to work for,again this comes from which store you are at..i have found that the management makes a big difference in how things are run.. if they dont care than why should you?,Home Depot
11823,"""It all depends on where you are in the organization""",3.0,I loved the company's passion for taking care of customers.,"People aren't valued. Sadly, sales and politics rule.",Home Depot
11824,"""Only work here as your last resort to get a job""",2.0,Pros=better than being unemployed. You can discover products for your own home that you were not familiar with working there.,"Only work at Home Depot as a choice between being unemployed or finding SOMEWHERE to work as a job or a place to work in desperation. Upper corporate states something like, ""take care of your associates and everything else takes care of itself"". This may be a sincere attitude of upper corporate but lower corporate generally consists of an array of ****suckers that upper corporate knows nothing about with their shenanigans and gratuities with their quid pro quo. It is a giant company and just about everyone means nothing. The first thing you find at Home Depot is no communication other than personal discussions with other associates and orbiting managers that rarely even have a word with you. Home Depot is generally an unsupervised work environment with associates disappearing all the time without anyone caring where they are. If you are a dedicated employee, you will find yourself doing their jobs too. Department Managers are rarely in departments unless the Store Manager is walking around, otherwise socializing or on the phone with their girlfriend or hitting on the cashiers. Home Depot generally promotes people to Department Managers that are using in the 20 to 28 year age bracket. They then can delegate to some seasoned older workers and very knowledgeable in some case that are usually never promoted. I don't understand why there hasn't been an age discrimination suit against this company. Then they can rudely order around those of their father's age while knowing nothing. Attractive females that date managers get promoted. One very pregnant in my store. 'Respect your elders' is not a concept used by Home Depot, imo. I have never seen anyone over 40 promoted. Managers usually walk around and you do not hear anything from them unless a customer may be complaining and he may ask you a question. No ASMs walk my store to see if people are working or to supervise employees for efficiency. The phone is most of the time not answered. If you sell at a high rate nobody cares really. If you search the Internet you will find many firings of people that claim they were high-number-sellers. An associate can and will be easily fired if writing an order with a mistake costing the company on the first offense. In fact, the whole store including the managers up to the Store Manager lives day to day with the fear of being fired. Many of their judgements are based on this alone. The store is actually ran quite like a Marxist organization where usually any promotions you hear are political and cannot be tied into anything known of accomplishment in labor or solid sales numbers. They do enough Affirmative Action not to get in trouble with the EEOC but that is it. ASMs usually do not know anything about the products in the department and have no clue to serve any customer that has anything of a technical nature in a question. ASMs usually leave too on the first opportunity to work with a 'normal' company, imo. For more skilled workers they use a concept called ""rifting"". They may hire a licensed plumber for example at 25 dollars an hour, have him in the department training 10-12 dollar any hour employees for a few month and then fire him after he trains the low wage workers. ""Rifting"" is well known about in the Home Depot work environment. This can also happen with, say, a kitchen designer that earns $20 per hour. Someone new may come in at $12 per hour that unexpectedly is pretty good and the designer will be railroaded out who earned the $20, imo. Working at Home Depot is a job and better than being unemployed , but hang in there until the economy has picked up to move on and get your respect back. If you have a choice of Home Depot or another job, do yourself a favor and take the other job even if slightly lower in pay. A lot of the longer employees and just about all I know are on medications for nerves after working there for a duration. I kid you not. It is also well known that when Home Depot managers usually at the ASM level write up an associate for something minor what is on the write up is complete fiction or exaggeration that I believe protects them from lawsuits. This is very, very common and I have often wondered why there was never a class-action suit of multiple people who have received fictitious writeups. If you have a choice of another job or Home Depot, stay away from Home Depot. It is really an absurd place to work. I write this completely honestly and have no agenda/anger but trying to be helpful.",Home Depot
11825,"""A Realistic Assessment of Home Depot as a place to work""",3.0,Fellow employees for the most part are supportive and committed to providing the best service they can to the customer base. Customers too for the most part are reasonable in their expectations of the employees who work in n environment where it is virtually impossible to know everything about entire store contents. An interesting exercise in creating solutions for customer problems.,"A lot of lip service paid to training, much of it is quite trite as well as being geared more to the US. In addition beyond the first month it is difficult to go off the floor to complete the required training. Although store systems are being updated, they are often cumbersome and unreliable and again the training does not delve into the complexities necessary to feel comfortable with the systems. Too many situations where department supervisors request something be done which is later contradicted by next level management thus wasting considerable time.",Home Depot
11826,"""base compensation on individual employee performance.""",4.0,"Individual effort is appreciated. Gender bias seems to not be an issue, at least in my store.","Pay is too low, and too many floor assiciates are just taking up space, not putting in any real effort.",Home Depot
11827,"""Sad Times in Winnipeg for THE HOME DEPOT!!!!""",1.0,Only work here if you have no choice..... this would be the last place I would look to start a career.,They seem to promote the lap-dogs to management. Also prepare to have no life at all. They will not let you change your availability for anything..... This place kinda reminds my of 'lord of the flies' or 'Animal Farm'. The only thing THD has going for them is the name...... but that is almost gone. Can't wait for Lowe's to kick there asses!,Home Depot
11828,"""You can Do it We can Help.""",4.0,"Lots of knowledge to be gained here. If you like helping people learn about their homes and their neighborhoods. Some people find that moving up in the company is very easy and accomplished quickly. Good place with many benifits including health, dental, vision, 401 k, stock options and great community involvement. Benifits are not paid by employer 100%. The quality of employees has significantly improved over the years. The company is now seeking people with actual working knowledge of home repair and everything that goes with that. There are Master Trade specialists in both Plumbing and Electrical that are wonderful postions with a lot of respect.","Major downside is often times the staffing is very sparce. The biggest complaint of customers is that there is no one to help them out. The company staffs it's stores based on sales and if a store is in a ressesion or dooing poorly their hours are cut drasticly. The other downside to Home Depot is if you want to be full time you technically have to be ""full time, Full flex"" which means you must be able to work any shift that your specific department needs. Now most managers will make many exceptions to the rules but it really depends on the managment.",Home Depot
11829,"""train your supervisors""",3.0,fun and close to home,total incompetence of supervisors and management. low pay. They are concerned only with the almighty dollar. They give away merchandise to customers who complain thinking that these customers will be loyal. Unfortunately these same customers just tell other people to complain or just return the good s they have been using and they will get thier money back.

And some stand-out, but few, amazing supervisors.","It is agreed among associates at the Home Depot Canada that there are ""too many Chiefs and not enough Indians"". They do not have the bodies to fill the sales floor and provide customers with the satisfaction they seek and have seen in popular media advertising. Instead, the many on duty managers and supervisors are too preoccupied by their store phones and blackberries to ease the congestion of customer dissatisfaction.",Home Depot
11832,"""The Right career move at the right time in your career.""",3.0,"Home Depot can be an excellent place for salaried management - with the right team to work with. There is career growth and opportunity to take on additional projects, and great leadership training. The volunteer organization, Team Depot, is actively involved with the community, and that makes one proud to be associated with THD. Salaries are good, particularly when you are ""education light"" in your field, and the benefits package is the best in retail. With a few exceptions, the Core Values set by the founders 28 years ago are alive and well.","Extremely long hours and an overwhelming list of responsibilities is the norm in the Mid-Atlantic. Opportunity to express concerns above a certain level is completely dependent on the individuals one works directly with. Using vacation time can be difficult, and the 55+ hour requirement can be a strain on family life (particularly with a rotating schedule and the necessity to work many weekends and holidays)",Home Depot
11833,"""reasonable part time job for self motivated students""",3.0,"The company is quite flexible with regards to part time hours, particularly with students. The work can be quite fulfilling at times, especially helping customers who truly need help to properly complete a project. Opportunities to gain knowledge. Some very knowledgeable associates and vendors. Recently instituted a health and benefits package for part time associates.","No employee discount. On the job training is lacking. Current Sales Associates take personal responsibility for training new associates rather than management. The employee stock purchase plan is not worth anything because the Home Depot stock is decreasing. Store, department, and assistant managers do not regularly help in departments, and when they do help frequently give improper advice or refuse to seek help if they are not qualified to answer a customers questions. There is an over-reliance on metrics when assigning hours weekly, this causes under staffing issues when some weeks are more busy than others. When associates call in sick, there are usually no reserve associates who can be called in, causing under staffing issues.",Home Depot
