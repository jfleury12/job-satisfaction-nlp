Commission has been changed to bonus, so they have more flexibility in making it nearly impossible to get. You are forced to carry budgets for companies that no longer do business with TD. The new compensation plan is extremely difficult to calculate considering they are beginning to limit employee visibility to sales figures and instead you rely on occasional updates from the same compensation team that messes up paychecks multiple times every year. We are also required to carry budgets for other team members despite not having the visibility or ability to affect those sales. TD is quietly changing all sales commission plans to a bonus format with numerous sales growth gates that makes it very easy to get zero bonus if you miss anything. Less $ for you, more for TD. My group was the first to change last year and a 2nd team was changed last quarter. They are going slow to limit the impact of employees quitting. This effectively lowered my pay by 20%.

A lot more seasoned employees are quitting or moving on. Unless you are placed on a ""lucky"" team, then you are more than likely going to deal with a toxic work environment. Management shows obvious favoritism. It is a numbers crunching game where skills such us organization or creativity will get abused but not recognized. I wouldn't let any supervisors know about health problems (physical or mental), because it gets taken advantage of or spread around the office. I saw a handful of team members leave because they felt unsafe about their privacy and told to put work first. There is often lots of free food and training available, but sales teams will pressure you to skip break or not take advantage of the opportunities around you because it's a team over personal development mindset. Make sure NOBODY finds out if you want to switch to a different department. Management might tell you that they support internal transfers, but many people feel pressured to leave for a new job because there is a 1.5 year requirement before being able to move to a new department. Workers get treated differently if they don't show blind loyalty to sales. There is also a trend of promote good workers to internal positions that may not use their skillsets efficiently-only to lock them down in the department longer. If anyone has watched as many Ted Talks as I have, my advice is to be very, very cautious if you are a Giver. People who are Takers or Matchers will move up quicker and be rewarded much better. The company has not figured out how to pinpoint their key people who value quality over quantity. If you can scam or fluff your productivity numbers (which isn't difficult if you find the right tools or master certain vendors), then you are golden.

During the earlier part of my employment, there were no issues; I worked peacefully at my station by myself as a void fill operator without any problems with supervisors or other employees until late in my employment. Was a temporary employee for one year through Staffmark Temporaries, then was hired permanently, with a raise. Worked a lot of overtime during some periods but received good compensation.","In early 2018, a woman in her late 20s told me, while on the job, confidential stories about her personal relationship, and that when she was 19, she first became involved in an intimate relationship with her 14-year-old boyfriend. I was quite astonished that somebody would tell me this while at work. When I told other employees and management, one of the managing staff told me not to dare say anything about it, appearing to defend the woman. At that point forward, Tech Data began building a file, alleging numerous things from being too loud, to damaging equipment. Furthermore, a man in his early 50s was making inappropriate remarks to and coercing an 18-year-old girl who worked there, and, in my personal opinion, believing that was wrong, raised an objection, when he responded to me, rudely and loudly, almost appearing to acknowledge his wrongdoing, “You know what? I don’t like you anymore! Don’t talk to me!”. In May 2018, I was escorted from my workstation to the manager’s office, where I was told that I was terminated, and the two managers who were present made sarcastic remarks, smiled and joked about the matter, and, while smiling, told me that I spit on the equipment, which was untrue, along with other similar allegations. I had applied for unemployment benefits which were initially denied due to Tech Data’s allegations, however, in my appeal, which was successful, and based on these facts, Texas Workforce Commission ruled that I was not at fault. Tech Data was a good company, and there were many nice employees who I enjoyed working with, however, I believe that towards the end of my employment there, I was treated very badly by management. Furthermore, Tech Data refused to hand over a copy of my employee file or disciplinary records, and also failed to hand over any relevant documents (other than a voluntary resignation packet) upon the termination, giving me limited evidence for complaints (other than the TWC ruling, where the employer, Tech Data, failed to appear at the hearing).

The company is just so large which is cool in a lot of ways but the company culture really isn’t there. Most of the jobs are boring so people spend all day gossiping which is annoying to listen to. The pay is very low and getting raises is a standardized process so they are low and after certain lengths of time. Switching positions or moving up to a higher role takes about 18 months I think.. and then you have to stay at that role for another 18 months I believe. So it is a slow and long process to move up in the company. There are also so many other people with the exact same boring, low pay job as you who also want to move up. I wasn’t in sales so the interview and hiring process took over a month. My friend who works in sales ended up applying for a higher level job after 18 months of employment and that process took her 4 months to transition to the new job. I think she had to wait a whole month to hear back. That personally would be really stressful for me. That was when i knew i didn’t see a future with the company. I couldn’t imagine waiting 18 months to be able to apply for a barely better job, get a $3 raise, and then have to patiently wait a month to hear back.

It's hit or miss with who you'll be working for and with and there are some standout wonderful people there. I met some of my best friends there, but that is more related to physical location than working environment I would assume. - I thoroughly enjoyed my time with TD before the merger, but it's a different company with new a new leader, set of principles, and direction.","- Office politics run rampant. - Lack of standardized training in nearly every department. - Lack of direction and feedback will depend entirely on your manager as they operate semi-autonomous fiefdoms of desk clumps. - Despite local awards, there is an obvious lack of real inclusion. An overbearing conservative mindset only fosters this as they use anecdotal examples rather than real solid statistics to market this facet. - HR is there to look out for the company and often powerless or straight unwilling to make any improvements. - Open floor plans do not foster a positive environment especially when the wage gap between even team members is stifling. It's also terrible for concentration in a technical field or when working with large calculations. - Lower level people (nearly all the general employees) are often kept entirely in the dark but are expected to react swiftly and with little to no support. - Will treat your employment like a gift you cannot repay. - High turnover in sales, internal logistics, and at logistic centers (warehouses). - Willing to undergo massive remodeling and branding projects while enduring layoffs had an unsurprisingly negative effect on company morale. - There is a clear double-standard in terms of daily responsibilities and expectations for what is seen as the ""inner-circle"" of management and their confidants and the rest of the employees. (The 13 Club was a nickname for the entry level people that felt a clear divide between those making entry level pay for years and those shopping for new Mercedes at their desk loudly.) There's nothing quite like watching bonuses get literally handed out to your team members while you're struggling. - Compared to a lot of places around here the pay is standard, but for IT professionals who are often able to work remote at companies, the financial incentive is minimal. - Meetings to have meetings about meetings. It's 2017 and anything that can said in a meeting can be done on a WebEx or in email. There are much better ways to build trust between a team than a meets on weekly numbers. - Don't expect a cost of living or raise in general without a promotion.",Tech Data

On top of that, a lot can go wrong that isn't your fault but everyone will point their fingers. The order placement system is complicated to say the least and you have to remember a million different specifics depending on what vendor you're placing the order for. Orders also have to touch many departments to be released. If you don't follow up with logistics because they didn't release the order, it's your fault again that the customer didn't recieve their product. At the end of the day a customer isn't happy if they don't recieve their order so you have to play every single role and other departments aren't held to the same responsibility as you are. Because of that there is a lot of pressure on SSRs to place orders correctly, fix issues, and do everything else for their team's very spoiled and demanding customers.

Most companies out there are still cutting back on benefits and it was nice that TD brought them back.",Upper management seems disconnected with what is actually needed from middle management.

490,"""Not the worst place to work but nowhere near the best""",2.0,"The previous review hit the nail on the head. It's a paycheck. Big company, so you can always find people you like and enjoy working with. It's good if you like a monotonous workplace. A negative to some, to be sure, but it is nice to always know what you're going to get. There are very few surprises.","For some reason a decent percentage of lower and mid-level management seem to be poorly suited for the job. My manager was friendly and positive, but clueless as to how I did my job. The pay is okay, but opportunities for advancement aren't as plentiful or fairly rewarded as you'll be told in the interview. There are A LOT of meetings and I swear I've been to meetings to discuss if there were too many meetings. It's not a bad place to work, but it really is a gray cubicle environment and that wore on me over time. When I put in my two weeks I had about half to 75% of the people I work with admit they hated their jobs and couldn't wait to go somewhere else.",Tech Data

Make sure you fluff up your resume since other companies in the area also view Tech Data as a entry level company. Other perks you can get from working in sales or marketing are some free products, event tickets and shirts. It is a paycheck albeit on the low end of a salary range for comparable positions at other companies.","There are many downsides to the company: low pay, unqualified management who have no sense of the industry or business in general for that matter. The only way Tech Data knows how to make money is to bilk their vendors out of marketing dollars by overcharging for activities, but then not following through with them. They embelish reports to make business look better than it is. I've been working in corporate America for over 20 years and this is the first company that I ever heard the phrase ""throw you under the bus"", and the only place I've ever experienced it. I think they pretty much coined the phrase. Mangement is so lacking in skills the only way they can make themselves seem taller is by cutting off the heads of their subordinates. They don't lead by example and many times there are feuds between director and director, manager and manager, etc. It sets the tone for the entire company. They are their own problem and it's keeping them from growing business.",Tech Data

Just watch out, they do a reduction in force every February.","you will not be able to move into a higher position unless someone dies OR you are liked by all managers. You will be worked to the bone and only be told how the managers did good to achieve what needed to be done. There is NEVER any compensation for the long hours you put in. MAYBE a vendor buck! if you are not liked, the managers do not hide that fact. If you are a temp you really need to careful. This company has a revolving door and they do not need an excuse to let you go. There is never any room for improvement. even if you suggest something to manager or directors that could possibly better the company,it will never be YOUR idea. they look at you like you have two heads, fire you for the suggestions, BUT they still implement the suggestion under their terms to make themselves look good. the senior management is deceitful, they even go after leads and areas managers just to save their own hides. The director also cannot make a decision unless he/she follows up with her favorite mangers, (who need to be fired). If you like to be lied to then this is the company to work for. They have the lowest starting rate, can't keep their customers happy, but STILL manage to blame the employees instead of looking at themselves. If they didn't have a reduction in force (letting go veterans of the company) EVERY February, then maybe they would be able to keep their customers happy, instead of bringing in new people who consistently screw up.

Oh and the Cafe food is pretty good too I guess.","The salary and compensation is garbage. For a position that has as many responsibilities that it has, you would think that base pay would be good. Wrong..Base pay is good if you live at home with you parents and don't have a mortgage, car payments, or any other life long financial obligations. You might start to think that if the base is low, then the commission must be good to make up for it. Sadly, wrong again. The goals that are set out for you are unrealistic and unattainable with the resources and accounts that are given to you. Management seems more concerned with micro managing and assigning pointless tasks. For example, the role of a sales rep should be to make sales. Instead, lets piles endless amounts on paper work and reports to fill and have countless degrading meetings causing sales people to be away or unable to make their sales calls. Tech Data also doesn't seem to recognize or acknowledge the staff that have outstanding talents. For example, a position comes looking for someone who will be knowledgeable in a product line (ie Desktops, laptops) in order to support the sales staff with technological questions with product line. 2 people interview, one who has no prior experience in dealing with technology and this is their first technology sales job but has a University Diploma in something completely irrelevant to this job , and another person who has 1) Previous technology sales experience, 2) Previous experience as a technician. The best choice would be to go with the person who has the experience. Nope! The person with the University Diploma (not relevant to this career field) gets the job, and for the next several months emails and IM's the other candidate technology questions that they are getting. So essentially what I'm saying is this, if you want good salary, good commission, less politics and a honest chance to grow within a company, please consider these examples and look elsewhere.",Tech Data
