Manager positions go unfilled even when existing managers try to twist arms and offer encouragement. The smart people know it's a trap and say no - even the ones identified as high-potential employees who are given special nurturing. A few of us retirees have occasional lunch with still-working employees. Apparently the environment has not improved and new employees only last a few months before shaking the LM dust off their feet and moving on. There is no sense of team nor collegiality within so the still-employed have to look outside for some social contact . Not an iota of understanding of ""social capital"" to be found. I put up with it so my chronically ill wife could get treatment. When she died - I was done with LM.",Lockheed Martin

The way programs work makes time tracking extremely important. Most companies will not care if you work 7 vs 8 vs 9 hours if your work is done well. This company cares that you sit in physical office seat for all the required hours (usually 9) whether or not work is there to be done (again with no electronics, but doing anything but ""working"" is time theft).

It's worth noting that there seemed to be a pretty ingrained atmosphere of subtle sexism. That's what happens when you get a bunch of awkward male engineers to work together, I think. I frequently heard male employees making jokes about their girlfriends/wives, and women in general. As far as I could tell, the women in my program were treated fairly and kindly, but it was hard to get past the sense that it's a boys club (I'm male, but I still felt uncomfortable in the office).

The following cons are made from a software engineering perspective. Major Grievances: - Most of the company is living in the past. It is extremely difficult to acquire modern software for any projects. Therefore, it is difficult to keep up with the rest of the world in knowledge of software technology. - Mostly awful programming practices. Although there are a few rare individuals who care about good software, most of the engineers I have encountered write and heavily rely on unmaintainable, difficult to read, and bad code. - Very difficult to move to other projects. I found that it is very difficult to move to different teams despite what you hear from interviewers and management. - Culture of Complacency. People have been doing the same thing for 20+ years and are very resistant to change. (Cshell, C++98, archaic version control tools, and more). Very difficult to make positive changes. - Moving up in the company based on seniority and not skill. You will meet lots of senior engineers that have been with the company for 15+ years who are at the skill level of a college graduate. - Noncompetitive pay. Your salary at Lockheed Martin will be significantly lower than having a software engineering position in any other company - Mediocre benefits. - Marginal raises. There is a fixed tier system that ranks you against the entire department. So even if you did great on your team, you will. probably be ranked low compared against the entire department. I got a 2% raise this year... - No bonuses, no incentives to work harder. Often, people get put in positions with increased responsibilities but with no increase in compensation. - Little to no training. The company has very little training and does little to teach you and help you improve as an engineer. I was lucky enough to meet one good engineer who mentored me but even this engineer left the company out of frustration. - Very low retention rate. Software engineers come in because of Lockheed's reputation and leave quickly out of frustration Smaller annoyances: - Little to no amenities. Pay for your own coffee. Pay for your own snacks. Some cool discounts available here and there. - Overtime Gate. Have to work a certain amount of hours of overtime before they start to count. Example: work 45 and you get no overtime. work 46 hours and you get 1 hour of overtime Overall, you can get lucky and be placed in a good team with good people. But the norm seems to be the opposite.

The culture experience for me personally has been anti-female, anti-millennial, anti-advancement, full of bullies, negative peer competition and backstabbing coworkers. You will be treated as many of the following stereotype cliche phrases read: seniority rules, totem pole, last man in first man out. You will be told to prove your worth when noteworthy assignments are handed out to favorites. You will be treated like the new guy until the next new guy comes along (which could be 5+ years) . There are boys clubs, quite literally, in every department. If you aren't personal friends with management you will get thrown under the bus when it comes to career opportunities. Atlanta area site has been undergoing a culture change initiative because of these issues. IMO the only reason HR pushed out the culture initiative is to have a measurable metric, (read anonymous survey) to prove the culture has improved. The turnover rate is incredible for young people. New training rolled out to enforce ""how to work with millennial's"". Because senior Lockheed employees treat the now largest age range in the workforce like they're worthless. One of the biggest initiatives is how to retain new talent... I cannot make this stuff up. Oh and do not bother complaining to HR about any of these issues. HR is built to protect the company not the employee. They supplement the negative culture and feed the middle management monsters it creates.

I found the work to be interesting, management enlightened, and it was a company that cared for its employees as well as its shareholders. When I started there as a young engineer in 1967, as long as you worked your butt off , were smart, learned fast and used good judgment, you had a career for life. I think it is different now","I worked for Lockheed for 32 years, retiring as a Director at age 55 after serving as a Director of Engineering and then Director of Programs for space programs in Sunnyvale for over 15 years. The salaries they (and other Aerospace companies as well) are giving to both young engineers and experienced engineers are very low, compared to other non-engineering professions. When I left Lockheed 20 years ago, a senior staff engineer made $110K, from the data presented here, it looks like the salary is around $120K!! 9% salary increase in 20 years or 0.5%/year? I own a national manufacturing company and pay my supervisors with little or no college who are in their early 30's more than young aerospace system engineers. This is not right.

Most do not care about their staff; they only care about looking good in the Stay-Green Meetings (whether a project is on track), and upper management doesn't care about how the manager got those numbers, as long as they're in the green.

(The Orlando office is gigantic. About 1/3 mile from one side of the facility to the other.)","High management to employee ratio on smaller teams. Leads tend to be hard to get a hold of and sometimes you have as many leads as employees. They system of management sets work up so that teams are intentionally kept apart and that management is the only proper means of communication. My belief is that this setup is designed for their larger projects which are over 60% of their contracts but they try to apply the same design across the board. However, it just causes chaos on small teams and breaks down communication when partner teams (electrical, systems, software, I&amp;T) can't work together directly. Maybe this works better on larger projects like their F-16 contract which I believe is 50% of their revenue (public data). Skill doesn't necessarily bring about leadership. Many times people are asked to apply online if they want to move up to a higher position instead of just being given promotions based. When problems occur, whether corrective action is taken is dependent on who's in your chain of command and who the complaint is about. Many times double standards are held if the issue occurs with a lead even if documentation can be provided.

813,"""“Ten Signs Your Company Couldn’t Care Less About You – Business Insider” Lockheed easily hits all of those points""",1.0,"You will most likely start your career at Lockheed as a CPE (certified principal engineer) delegate (discount) where you will be doing administrative engineering (level 4 role) while receiving a level 1 or 2 salary grade (had a MSEE colleague who started at L2 but still severely underpaid). My experience and perspectives I can share about Lockheed comes from a large sample size of many individuals who have had over 30 years of experience to where you could easily say they know too much about the company and what goes on behind closed doors. So yes, this is going to be a pretty detailed review. Your experience at Lockheed will vary greatly depending on your manager, team, and program. Unfortunately, the program I worked in had nothing good you could say about it except that some of your colleagues may also share the same concerns as you. One of the funniest things someone said to me to get me to stay was that “you do get paid on time” as if being paid on time was a perk no other Fortune 500 company could offer. If you want my TL; DR advice: know what you want… Get out ASAP if you are looking for a place where you have an opportunity to change the world, develop technical expertise, and most importantly get paid what you are worth.","TL; DR – If you google “Ten Signs Your Company Couldn’t Care Less About You – Business Insider” Lockheed easily hits all of those points without any effort. Backstory: I was on one of the programs which ended up moving from CA to CO. A good decision for current board of directors to save costs, up returns for shareholders, and increase their annual bonuses but bad for you, the employee esp. if you just graduated college and want to be where things are happening in Silicon Valley with all the other young professionals (more opportunities). Since they announced the move back in 2017, every week, we literally had 1-5 employees either retire or grabbed by a Tech company in Silicon which paid 2x-3x more. We also had a bunch of managers stolen by Tech (my manager included) as well which clearly shows the power of money and the ability to buy out talent which pretty much left Space Systems with average performers in general. Upper leadership straight up lied to the employees saying they will potentially get to have a new building in Sunnyvale as they placed a model of a brand new building in one of the lobbies. Fact check: that was from a Google acquisition and that building will be for Google employees. There is a LOT of politics as you would expect and it’s a big reason why people leave… I knew a previous manager who was fired for not following company polices so to combat that the directors had to hire someone from the club who they could trust to 100% follow orders and company policies (you have to sell your soul to the company to become a manager+). If he were to break any policies, he would have probably been disciplined or kicked out of the club and would not be able to ascend to the director level. But this completely sets the program up for failure moving forward because now you have new leadership based on buddy-buddy politics. In addition, new management is forced to follow a rigid set of rules which, according to many successful managers and CEOs I know, is a bad way to manage people because it assumes a one-size-fits-all or one-rule-fits-all for every situation. But contradicting that, managers still have favorites where exceptions are made. Take this for instance, there were a lot of times a colleague of mine was constantly bullied by a senior but less experienced engineer (they bumped up less senior engineers to more senior as they could not find anyone externally to fill the talent gap or anyone who wanted to do administrative engineering) for not being able to complete tasks which he never even got briefed on. Instead of the senior engineer owning up to lack of guidance and leadership skills, my colleague had to own up to it. I’m almost certain he left the company or is in the process of leaving. Another colleague of mine who was on the same program requested things such as WFH as he was the only one living a couple of hours away from work. Instead of empathizing, leadership labeled him as the “entitled millennial” which is interesting because the guy was one of the few people left in the program who actually got things done. Also, the definition of millennials goes back to about anyone born from 1981 to 1996 such that – ironically – most of the new leadership themselves are in fact millennials. I’m pretty sure the guy is no longer there and got picked up by a Tech company, what a shame. I knew an engineer in a more senior role who I seriously believed was on a track to be a manager or a director. Unfortunately they made him – and I couldn’t even believe this – literally sort papers in a 1940s shed (totally fiscally responsible to charge the government $300+/hr/engineer to file papers instead of hiring someone to sort and package them for $10/hr right?). Needless to say, he said that it was his first job at Lockheed and certainly his last. Some more red flags: 1) Program was awarded a 420M contract in 2017, in 2018 directors did not know how to utilize that money to get things sorted out and relocated from CA to CO. 2) Inexperience flows down from the top as I said, the whole buddy-buddy politics caused this to happen and now you have a bunch of unqualified people in a senior role. 3) Facility/infrastructure was so degraded that it’s questionable if it has ever been OSHA certified in the past decade. There were times were the smell would be extraordinary, or times we had no water to drink or no A/C and pipes broke due to lack of maintenance (one manager quit because a pipe burst on him, it was the most ridiculous thing I’ve seen)… Seriously, hope I didn’t get cancer from anything… It was much easier to see the world of difference between Defense and Tech in Silicon Valley by walking across the street and grabbing lunch on the Google campus. That was a wake-up call. And yes, if you are wondering, Google does have water, A/C, and electricity. 4) In 2018 they rolled out what they called Destination Wellbeing which announced higher deductible plans or something along the lines of “the company will no longer cover you for x, y, and z anymore, that’s on you”. This roll out got so much bad press that people were calling it “Destination Bankruptcy” and one of the SVPs had to step in, delete comments, and shut down their internal blog post (I mean… What else did they think was going to happen? Shows how out of touch the board members are with the rest of the company). Several of weeks later they literally had some SVP guy give a blog post about how great it is to be underpaid and have no benefits. It was something you certainly had to see to believe! 5) Lockheed’s inability to retain talent, effective leaders, and move quickly (actual design and development at Lockheed happens about once every 40 years...) causes competitors like SpaceX and Blue Origins to offer the government a better service at a lower price point while grabbing a bigger piece of the pie which was once Lockheed’s. What once was thought a stable company might not be stable several decades from now if this trend continues. There are some exceptions like the FBM program but as I said before, if you are a new grad, do you really want to work at a place that does not challenge you and you have to live with a product which was designed to basically (hopefully) never ever be used for the rest of your career? 6) To add to my previous bullet regarding productivity, there were many times when we would have 8+ person meetings were we charge the government $300+/hr/engineer just to debate how many columns an Excel Spreadsheet should have or how many slides a PowerPoint should have. Next thing you know the joke at the weekly staff meetings would be “how many Lockheed employees does it take to screw in a lightbulb and what’s the cost to the taxpayer per hour?” 7) Pay back in Silicon Valley was about 50% of what other engineers were being paid at Tech companies. If that doesn’t sound degrading to you I’m not sure what does. Lockheed only seems to be able to retain people who a) do not know their true market value b) are so blindly passionate about aerospace such that they are taken advantage of by upper leadership.",Lockheed Martin

This is a well-oiled script amongst LM employees that primarily consists of ""anonymous"" reports to Ethics, various Vice Presidents, and the CEO. The allegations don't have to be true. Since LM is absolutely opposed to even the potential appearance of impropriety, an employee can experience serious consequences for the potential and appearance of improper behavior (it doesn't have to have actually occurred) and/or the behavior of people they associate with even if they never engaged in the behavior or endorsed it. This applies anywhere and anytime regardless of whether employees are at work, at a public place before/after work, or at home. The consequences for perceived, potential and real offenses are recommended by Ethics and Human Resources but ultimately determined by the employee's leader regardless of what the leader says when they dole them out. The use of ethics to harass others, along with other behaviors that were just as disturbing and controlling, made it a priority to pursue a significantly different work environment.

Because Lockheed Martin is so big, there is a lot of opportunity to learn about the defense industry. There is a wealth of knowledge among many employees who have worked at Lockheed for a long time, and Lockheed does a good job of not overwhelming new candidates in my experience. There are a lot of growth opportunities, and there is an increased emphasis in diversifying the experiences of the employees. Lockheed Martin is a company that prides itself on integrity, and that is evident in the way that it treats its employees and how it conducts business. If you are interested in learning about and being a part of the defense industry, Lockheed Martin is a great company to work for. My experience with management has been positive, and I have seen an effort toward empowering decision making toward the lower levels of management.","It is hard to see your role in the grand scheme of things. Lockheed Martin's products are complex and most of the functions are very removed from the actual product. Lockheed Martin is a very large and bureaucratic company. While I mentioned that there is an effort to drive decision making down to the lowest levels, this is a slow process and there is still a long way to go. Lockheed Martin can only lean out its processes as much as its customer allows. This is still a very risk averse industry, and having the government as a customer means that things go slower. Finally, Lockheed Martin is a defense contractor. While I'm proud to work for such an impressive company and feel that we do our work with integrity, I do feel disconnected from the customer as someone who has no affiliation with the military.

Management's actions were clearly against everything that Lockheed Martin purports to stand for. When I stood up to the pressure I became persona non grata. When I contacted their ""Ethics"" organization I was immediately dismissed and sent back to my program HR, which had failed to support me in the first place. The program manager who had tried, through my direct boss to pressure me into hiring a friend of his who was not the best qualified for the position and would have cost the program thousands of unnecessary dollars to accommodate, flat out lied to me about the fact that he had a personal stake and relationship with the unqualified person I refused to hire. He also felt it necessary to suggest that somehow I had used poor business judgment by not making the hire, even in spite of the fact that I hired someone better qualified and there were no problems or lack of performance. Above and beyond that, the program had a revolving door of incompetent managers at the highest level as well as those to whom I directly reported. There were a number of instances where PII and SSI were not handled properly, so much so that it resulted in the withholding of award fees from the client. Program management's incompetence and lack of basic client relationship communications and management talent resulted in multiple instances where money--ultimately tax payer money--was wasted and spent needlessly. There appeared to be no consideration or acknowledgment of this. Related to wasting tax payer dollars, the amount of money paid to subcontractors was practically criminal. Again, this is money that goes from our pockets to the Federal government, to government agencies, to contractors and their subcontractors. It was a generally poor morale and a toxic environment. There was a complete disregard for honest discussion of problems that had a direct negative and performance-impeding effect on my job.

Full health/dental/vision, 10 hours of vacation added per month. 50% matching for 401k up to 8%. Get plenty of company discounts in the area. They'll fully pay for your Masters as long as it's in a related field to what your position is, the program is accredited and you've been at the company for 1 year. For at least the team I am on, plenty of work to do, good managers, plenty of people to learn from, encouraged to branch out to other projects, or teams for ""stretch"" assignments. Relatively easy to move to different teams, departments and locations in the company. Just need to do a interview. Formal mentor system and plenty of leadership programs and seminars to help you grow/learn. Encouraged training hours and paid-for certifications.","Location security can both make you feel safer and paranoid. Cyber security policies as well. Everyone takes their 'level' too seriously. Meaning, a new employee is shunned, ignored, given little thought to when talking to or debating a Senior developer/manager/etc. Little transparency with management to employees. 'special rights and privileges' given to higher up managers, etc. They're behind the curve in both technology/skills used and workplace culture. They literally call their initiative to improve workplace culture: 'culture optimization'. Feels disingenuous, robotic and profit focused. Makes me think of when a company is trying to market to kids, you can tell they're trying hard to be 'youthful' when they're all too old. Same feeling with the manager is trying to figure out what their employees want. Additionally, they use a lot of older technology. I can only speak on the ASP.NET web development side. No teams use MVC, only WebForms. With C# application development, only WinForms is used. But some teams are trying to get into WPF. Confusing time-keeping system and budgeting between teams is a mess. Lastly, all of the cubicles are solid blue and ugly. Doesn't help me feel motivated :/",Lockheed Martin

They didn't pay DBA as they should have for painting or pipe fitting alterations and they never really calculated the SCA fringe benefits as correctly as they should have, but it was close enough for the lazy and politically appointed people down at the local DOL office. At least the DBA/SCA kept them mostly honest.","I was working for the largest defense contractor in the world. To my dismay, I discovered that they are too lazy and unconcerned to identify critical workplace hazards and too cheap to provide proper and might I add common sense and even inexpensive, protective equipment i.e. ""respirator"" programs for workers handling dangerous chemicals; although they are not required to do so under the antiquated OSHA laws. As a result, I was permanently injured on the job in my home state of Colorado. To add insult to my injury, I was made aware of the sad fact that we have been stripped of our legal right to sue for work place injuries in this state. I have no recourse against my employers’ negligence and they have no real incentive to provide a safe workplace in the first place! The Workman's compensation system handles all work-related injuries. The employer picks the doctors, or rather give you the ""choice"" of their two picks. You cannot see your own doctor, for fear your normal insurance provider won't pay. The unemployment doctors want employers to send them business, so guess who they work for? They are very skilled at setting up constant road blocks to treatment, let alone actual diagnosis and they're not afraid to shame you and even verbally abuse you while you are sick and standing before them. They actually let the insurance providers ""case worker"" sit in on clinic and specialists visits and guide the treatment! They have no shame. If you are eventually diagnosed with a permanent injury. Compensation payments are capped, ""very low"" by a schedule of different types of injuries. An eye is worth so much, a finger this much, etcetera, and then they pro-rate by the percentage of total use that was lost. Guess what? Not every type of injury is even listed. Nerve damage, brain damage, loss of balance or endurance for example, let alone pain and suffering. I tried to get legal help, but it was difficult as the lawyers already know all of this. Finally; after seeing their workman’s compensation doctor for nearly a year for this permanent workplace injury and receiving absolutely deplorable medical attention in the first place, my employer’s worker’s compensation insurance provider arbitrarily decided to deny my claim, simply stating that I was not injured in the workplace.

Speaking of that, I found a job at an 87% increase in pay, so don't let them keep convincing you that they pay 'competitively'. That 'total value' the speak of is garbage... health insurance premiums are through the roof compared to other employers and the employee out of packet maximums are absurd. I must also mention that when I left (on good terms with a previous 3 years' rating of '1', which is the highest possible), I was hassled for repayment of the tuition assistance I received.

At LM it's known that there are ""only three ways to get fired"" ... mischarging hours, selling company secrets, or purposefully looking at pornography at work. However, they become more and more strict about what you can/cannot do in downtime during my 5+ years there that ""mischarging"" lost all meaning and became an arbitrary method of removing someone from a position. - I can testify that the other engineers I worked with in ADP were great, great people. Intelligent, upstanding... in the group I was with, we referred to ourselves as a ""family"" for good reason. - I did get an ""in-level"" promotion after being there a couple years and then a full level promotion the year after that. However, career opportunities can be a bit deceiving since the only way to move up in the company is to move around in the company, that is, you literally have to jump from division to division (including moving around the country) just to get anything.","Where to start... - There were literal rats in our workspace, and the only thing the corporation would be willing to do would put down mouse traps and then remove the dead bodies hours after we called to complain about them. The rats could also be heard in the walls/ceiling of the restroom, and a dead rat was very visible in an access panel in the restroom. - There was also a fly problem in the workspace when a pipe leaked brown liquid in the ceiling. - It depended on your area, but I would venture to say the majority of the ""plant"" building (that is, the main building in Ft. Worth) had not been updated since the 70's and would best be described as ""dank"". Even the less dank areas are still windowless concrete bunkers. - I had 8 different managers in 5 years. The last two were not even cleared to the classified area in which I worked, so they had no idea what I even worked on (and, as such, had no loyalty). - Will not pay nearly what the position is worth, relying on the ""stability"" and work/life balance to make up the difference. - Old computers. For a company that wants to appear like it's on the bleeding edge of technology, they were permanently at least a few years behind in machine capability, operating system, and application version (Visual Studio 10 instead of 15). - It's very, very, very corporate.
