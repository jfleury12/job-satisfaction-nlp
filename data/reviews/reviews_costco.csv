The company works with a lot of legacy systems or with software feels like it is still stuck in the 80's or 90's. Management at other locations can be very political in some departments.

The more you work, the faster you get a pay raise. Working past 8 hours counts as overtime (pay x 1.5). Sunday pay is also pay x 1.5. Schedules are flexible, especially if you're a student. But remember, it is retail (at least at the warehouse level), so the management's/company's needs come first. Benefits are incredible, even with a part-time position. Instead of elaborating, I'll just say that you would want your company to have the benefits Costco has. When Google was #1 and Costco was #2 on Glassdoor a few years ago, not even Google's benefits were as good as Costco's. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I don't know if that's changed for Google. Management is pretty good. There have been three warehouse managers at my location since I started working there. The first one was lazy. The second was very hard-working (now retired).

82,Costco,Where to Start. Costco is very out of touch with Technology and the impact it plays on the modern work place. They try and stick with out dated philosophies that dont translate well and often alienate the skilled workers all while trying to shove the idea of culture down your throat. Skilled IT workers at Headquarters are treated as a burden. You can feel the distaste for them from Craig with how he handles issues. Craig insists on treating everyone like a Warehouse worker regardless of what you actually do for the company. This is great for Warehouse workers and deeming towards people who have developed skills for corporate environments. Often times you have managers in IT that started at the company as a cart pusher and have never had a job out side of Costco. They dont understand what they are doing and create all kinds of issues through out the IT department. You have people in IT who simply dont do their jobs or are so far out of their depths because they have risen through the ranks because of tenure . People who are new to the company are often dismissed and ignored when they try to help fix things. This eventually leads them just stop caring and fall in line with not doing anything. You have other managers and directors (ecomm) who are so full of them selves and are so loud they get what they want regardless of what policies have been put in place to protect the environment. Hence Costcos website went down on Thanskgiving. Its not the best workers that get promoted. Its the ones with the best Connections or the loudest voice. For warehouse worker Costco can be great but if you went to any type of schooling to get into the field you are in. I would avoid Costco. It will suck you in and you will slowly start to loose the skills that are needed to thrive outside of it. Costco has a CIO that no one really sees or knows what he does. VPs talk about how they discuss things with out companies CIOs but Costcos does not.

Supervisors often get very big headed with their positions and will take advantage of their role by belittling regular employees and abuse their break time. I've noticed a few flirting with young female employees even while being called for on their radio. Kiosk workers, managers and supervisors will walk around staring at their phones but will write up regular employees if this is caught. Costco shows no value for your time and will keep you there working when there is nothing to do, and will demand you stay until you are scheduled even if you've completed your job early. Even worse, part time employees who do not have schedule restrictions must work 5 days a week, meaning that even if you have been scheduled for only 20 hours, you will work 5 days 4 hours a day. I've also been a corporate employee, which was absolutely terrible. Completely rude and cocky buyers, assistant buyers, and managers overall, I've even heard that there are some groups of buyers, assistant buyers, and ICS's who live together and have families throughout buying, so dont expect to find very diverse opinions within buying. Maybe the company cared for its employees at one point, but after seeing managers promoted solely based on who their parents are, seeing managers and employees yelled at and belittled for the slightest reasons such as running out of a product for a few minutes, hearing about managers who have since stepped down because they were forced to work 7 days in a row 45+ hours a week for MONTHS without a day off; and all other things combined in my experience with costco, I believe have lost their way completely.

You'll be helping the cashiers put things in Members shopping carts. Don't expect much help from the Members to unload their carts filled to a brim, because they'll just leave them there and wait for you to do it. Then they'll ask for everything to be put in boxes, and it has to be done a certain way and the boxes have to be custom made or to their liking if you don't want to be insulted and called a useless worker. You'll also have to go fetch them items that they either realized they forget to grab, or they just decide in the last minute that they don't want some perishable items that you have to run all across the end of the store to put back. A lot of times, Members don't read the price signs, so they don't know that some items come in pair otherwise the cashier can't sell them. That's when you go fetch them the other item because they tell you flat out that they don't feel like going back on the other side of the store to get them. You'll do lots of fetching and returning perishable items, whilst trying to box their groceries.

201,Costco,"I have not read any of the other reviews here, but I will I be honest as I can about any 'cons' working at Costco: Nights and weekends. you give that up. At least until you make it to the top of the totem pole in your dept.. That can be hard if you are in a big dept like 'front end' or in a dept. where employees have been there for a long time. You can ask to have more opening shifts and maybe a weekend off. But be careful asking for Sunday off (Sunday pay is time and a half). If you are trying to have a family, it is rough working nights and weekends. That is why I went to a different career path. Wife worked 8:30 - 5 m-f. and I wanted to as well. But I know Costco employees who make it work. Favoritism/Friends - I don't see that much. But I know it exists. Costco recognizes that. Their warehouse managers and warehouse manager assistance are rotated with other warehouses to prevent that. However, lower level management usually aren't. I can see how they can create a relationship with their employees. It's honestly just human nature. But it is also unintentional in my opinion. It is your responsibility to recognize that and report it if you feel like you aren't being treated fairly. Costco has an open door policy. Tardy's- That is the only thing that bothered me. If you are late more than 3 times in a 30 day period, you will get written up. This has bit me in the butt a couple of times being that I didn't get out of class in time for whatever reason. Its easy to loose track how many tardy's you have sometimes, but it is your responsibility. The upside to that is, write ups fall off your record after 9 months. Their policy is, if you get written up 3 times within 9 months for the same thing, you will get suspended. if you get written up 4 times within 9 months for different things, you will get suspended. They make it hard to get suspended. You have to be a joke to loose your job at Costco. If you notice you are not able to make your shift on times, it is your responsibility to let you supervisor/manager know to work with you on your shift so you are not late. No call/no show - this is also something that bothered me, but understood why it is like that. According to the handbook, you have to call in no later than an hour before your shift or it is considered a no call/no show. Which means, if you call in 30 mins before your shift, its a no call/ no show. And a no call / no show is an automatic write up. Again, it falls off in 9 months. no biggie. its just, even if you called, if it is within the hour, its a no call no show. Black out days for vacation - This was also annoying working there. But not a deal breaker. Costco busiest time of the year is November and December. You cannot request vacation during November or December. So if you have a family tradition, know you may not be able to attend unless you work something out with the warehouse managers. Sometimes they might work with you, but most of the time, they might tell you 'if I let you have vaca then I'd have to let everyone have vaca'. Inventory - Costco does their own internal inventory twice a year, and the week inventory falls on, you will not be able have that week off. For instance, lets say inventory for your building is the second week of February, more than likely, you won't be able to take that week off. And you for sure will work inventory day. Whether you are running the business, counting that night. So if you anniversary or birthday is on inventory day, the best you can do is just ask to run the business so you can celebrate that night instead of counting inventory after the store closes. If you are counting inventory, your shift will most likely be 6pm-2am. However, inventory is not miserable. It can be fun, especially if you like counting. They do feed their employees who are counting with good food. Also, know if you are eligible for bonuses, you get your bonus on your check shortly after inventory. Which is a good way to keep tract when inventory is, or when you get your bonuses. My cons are not really cons. Like I said, I haven't read any of the other reviews. I am sure most of the bad ones are from losers who couldn't hold a retail job and wanted to come here to talk down about Costco. Like I said before, It is hard to get in, but it is hard to get fired. You have to be a loser to get terminated form Costco. I know I wasn't going to make Costco a career because I was in college. So I wasn't striving to be a manager, even though I did become a part time supervisor in the end. I loved working at Costco. I always knew, had I needed to, I could have made Costco my Career and been happy. I just didn't want to give up my nights and weekends with my wife. Costco is a retail store, but it is not just a job. You can make it a career and become a manager in a dept. making about $60k a year. Or a supervisor making about $40k-$50k a year. you might have to just give up your nights and weekends for it.","I tell everybody that if you do not have a Degree or know a trade, or if you are going to school and need a part time job, you need to work at Costco. To anyone reading this considering working for Costco, know that you could be a part time cart pusher making $25/hr getting bonuses twice a year, with excellent insurance and a 401k. Getting sick/vaca, and all the benefits you can think off. Just for being a good retail employee. The best way to get in at Costco is you have to know someone already working there who can vouch for you. OR, do what I did and ask for the hiring manager and make sure they know your name and face. That way when they are hiring, and they see your name, they can schedule an interview. Costco main hiring season is March/April. They also hire extra seasonal temporary employees in October. But just know that they can just let you go in January when seasonal position is done. It is a temp job. BUT when March comes around, you can ask for the hiring manager and let him know you worked there seasonal and loved it and want a permanent position. It is best to create a relationship with either the dept manager or hiring manager while working seasonal so they remember you when permanent positions open up. You start off making $13, IF you can get in. You get benefits (incl. sick/vaca) after your 9 month probation. The thing about Costco, if you are reliable and a good worker, meaning you aren't calling in, hardly late, and give excellent customer service, you will make it past your probation. Its that easy. So as long as you make it past your probation period, you will make it at Costco. Costco does not keep bad employees. They have a strict tardy/sick call policy. They have a strict attitude policy. You cannot go to work with a bad attitude and show it. Hint, that's why every time you go to Costco, everyone seems like they love their job. its easy and Costco takes care of them. You get raises based on the amount of hours you work, not by your work ethics like most companies. Like I said earlier, if you are employed at Costco, there is no reason you aren't a good worker or have good work ethics. So raises are based on amount of hours you work. they reward based on how much time you put in. Typically its 50 cents for the first 3 or raises then its $1 after that. Top out pay is near $25. That's how you can be a cashier assistant making great money. It's just based on the amount of time you work. You start out part time, min 24 hours a week. But you can always pick up shifts, ask other dept. to be crossed trained to further your knowledge at Costco making you able to pick up more hours easily. Plus, it lets managements know you are serious about being employed at Costco. Once a full time position opens up, you can apply for it. But know, there are other part timers who are putting in for that spot too who been there longer than you. But if you have no tardys/sick calls, and great relationship with managements/supervisor, and the others have lots of tardys/sick calls, you can easily be picked. The same goes to applying for supervisor positions. I've seen 2 year employees go from pushing carts, to becoming a supervisor and go from $14/hr (24hr/wk) to $26/hr (40wk) because they took care of business. Once you put in enough hours, you start to earn bonuses twice a year (after each inventory). and bonuses are based on, again, the amount of time you work. And its for full timers AND part timers. Another thing that is true about Costco - Sunday Pay. Its time and a half. So if you are making $25 mon-sat, you are making $37.50 on Sunday. You do not get employee discounts. You do get a executive membership ($120 yearly value) and 3 basic members to give out to family/friends ($180 yearly value) The good thing about getting the executive membership free, is that anything you buy (other than gas, pharmacy, and tobacco) you get %2 back yearly. So if you shop there, every year, Costco gives a check of what you earned and you can use it there, or cash it out. SO the pay is great. And like I said before, if you are working there, you are good employee. Which translate to, the people working at Costco are great to work with. You make friends, sometimes long lasting friends. I've seen employees meet their wives there. It is a family oriented retail store. They have EAP (employee Assistant Program) if you ever need it. Costco does care about their employees. Costco have Christmas parties and give away things. You get all major holidays off. Costco is an excellent place to work at. Costco does not mind hiring students. If you are in school, they work around your school schedule. You have to turn in your school schedule and let them know when you can work. They will never make you pick Costco over School. A lot of Costco employees who went to school and graduate sometimes just stay at Costco. I know an employee who finished their teaching degree, but ended up staying at Costco because of pay and everything else great about Costco. That how great working at Costco is. But they will never be a secondary employer. Meaning, if you work for Costco, and have another job, they will not work around another job you may have.",4.0,"""Costco is awesome to shop at and work for."""

296,Costco,"Lots of challenges. Always stressed, always under pressure, & highly criticized by members/management. The worst part is the management, & how they choose to run the business. They make a handbook & all these fancy 10 page long policies just to pick & choose when they want to follow them. So if you’re not a favorite you’ll get the handbook punishment, if you are favorited, you get an undocumented talk from a manager saying to correct an action. They are horrible at prioritizing. They break rules all the time, set horrible examples for leaders, yet expect lower employees to always do the right thing & not make mistakes. If you’re the kind of person to wear your emotions on your sleeve from things going on in your personal life, expect a conversation from a higher up telling you to essentially be a robot. They tell you they need you to get over it & overbear you with saying it’s not okay to feel that way at work because the members are more important & we don’t want to rub them wrong or ruin their shopping experience. Write ups are the literal definition of nonsense. One manager will tell you it’s okay to do X & then you get a write up a week later for doing said X. Communication is expected from lower workers, they ambush you with “you need to tell your higher up everything you do every time you do something”, yet the managers never communicate. You get frowned upon for not using the restroom on your breaks or lunches, especially within 30 minutes of taking them. When I was first hired everything I did was done the wrong way. I had one manager tell me how to do something & then the next manager I’d work with said that was wrong & showed me how to do it “correctly”. That is literally with everything, & every manager tells you how to do a task differently. It is stressful. The members are also extremely entitled, you’re expected to wipe the corners of their mouth after a meal. It is soul crushing. You just have to stand there smiling & eat it. Otherwise you get a write up for explaining the policies of the business, that you can’t allow them to break the rules because they “do it all the time”. So if you tell them they can’t do something you get in trouble, if you allow it you get in trouble. No winning. There are definitely cliques, a handful of employees are nothing but bored workers who create major drama. There are a ton of negatives, because I like to enjoy my work environment. Granted I know you get a fair share anywhere you go, but this place is overall exhausting. You can never win, even if you know you were in the right, it doesn’t matter to them. It wasn’t right enough, or that was good, but “do this instead next time”. They let the members walk all over you, & some employees. Like I said they pick & choose. It’s exhausting, frustrating, & stressful. You get guaranteed hours, but it gets stressful if you pay bills. One week/pay period you’ll work minimum 24 hours, the next almost 40. There was a span of 4 months that I got no more than 24 hours a week. That’s a 600 dollar check. When you work a ton of hours you can get up to 900+. If you were to apply, I would highly recommend to go to any department other than the front end. Every other department seems to run smoothly, front end is under a microscope. Managers always watching & picking your work ethic apart. As you can tell from my super long list of cons, it is a job that isn’t a joke, but also is. Major pros with major cons. The pay can be worth it at times, but all of the stress makes you dream of quitting. Main issue is management, if you can handle the rude, entitled members, that’s one thing, but the higher end is corrupt.",Most employees not in management are awesome to work with. The pay is probably the best part with guaranteed hours plus benefits. Always busy so time usually flies. Two breaks & a paid 30 minute lunch for an 8 hour shift. Shifts vary for part timers 4-8 hours. They are very much about a “sense of urgency” which basically means the job is your daily workout.,2.0,"""Cashier Assistant: packing groceries, running errands, pushing carts, stocking, blocking down,"""

I recommend not working at Costco Burnsville. Costco Burnsville is poorly managed. From the first day, working at Costco felt like a prison. A network of surveillance cameras and supervisors micromanage every move employees make. Management does not know how to respect employees, which they treat as disposable. Good employees are not promoted. Good employees do not receive training to advance. The turnover rate for employees Costco Burnsville is very high. After the warehouse closes in the evening, employees are required to have a supervisor let them leave the building. The work as a Front End Assistant at Costco Burnsville is grueling. I worked in -30 degree and 100+ degree Fahrenheit weather pushing carts for entire shifts at a time, often over the course of multiple days.

If you have to park at the main garage, be prepared to wait for the shuttle then wait as you stop at other buildings and going through Issaquah traffic.

You can literally cause a mistake that results in millions of dollars in lost profit/sales and nothing happens. Holiday vacation blackouts - this is the dumbest thing for IS. There is a change freeze during this time anyways. This is the PERFECT time for IS to be able to take vacation. Issaquah - traffic is so bad. Most of this is Costco corporate employees.

Poor communication from management. When I meet a lot of my coworkers in the position a lot of them came out and said they ""hated this job"" and left a toxic environment for new employees. The systems in place are a bit archaic and in need of refinement as there is manual forms for nearly everything. All of the temps, times in and out of the oven, and cleaning were marked on a paper form and a manager came by and just checked what was done or not done the night before. I never really had a relationship with my direct supervisor who only worked days and I may have spoke with her 2 times - poor communication skills. Overall regrettably a waste of time when I had other offers out there and I assumed all the good reviews were meaningful, not just fluff.","Not a lot that I could see. The job forcefully placed me into a union, so there are the benefits which come with that, ergo raises based on hours worked, support for grievances. The management had an open door policy and a lot of tenured employees seemed to love their jobs.

In my mind, it shouldn't be hard to train a new supervisor and teach them Costco values and ethics coming from another employer. Lack of communication between supervisors, breaks go out from 30-60 minutes late, throwing production off when staff of around 30-40 are waiting. I typically worked outside pushing carts, which I'm fine with but when we are told rules such as ""Don't wear your hoods while it rains"" because our manager would rather us get wet than get hit by traffic. I understand that but it came across as an insult to my intelligence. I can't fully turn my head side to side when crossing?

733,Costco,"-Management doesn't really care about you, and doesn't listen to feedback at all. We had an employee survey that, after many promises, was never given serious consideration by management. After repeatedly saying they would release the results, it was swept under the rug and no official response ever came out of it. The main response was to hire a different survey company, who released results that Costco IS had the worst results of any company they had ever surveyed. I also found internal documentation showing that management had paid for cultural consultants to come in years ago for an assessment. The consultants summarized all of the issues perfectly and management chose to ignore all of their feedback. Costco management has a culture of doing whatever they want at the expense of their employees. Costco management as a whole also has a reputation of being a good-old-boys club. Just Google ""costco management sexism"" if you don't believe me. Management is filled with suck-ups who really don't care about you, and only want you to fall in line. -Management is for the most part not technical at all, and this really hurts the IT organization. It wasn't uncommon for management to transfer from the warehouse to IT. The running joke was that we had bakery managers running things. -Costco IS has a culture of awarding tenure over ability. They don't care if you work hard or not. All that matters is how many years you've worn a Costco badge. This is reflected in the parking, vacation, 401k and other policies which reward people who have worked there the longest. It doesn't matter if you have 15 years of experience prior to working at Costco. You won't be taken seriously unless you've been there a really long time. Speaking of vacation, it is totally non-negotiable. You start with 2 weeks of vacation up until 5 years. The 401k is the poorest of any that I've ever personally seen with a maximum $500 match for the first year. They basically treat you like a warehouse worker even if you work in Corporate IT. -Parking absolutely sucks. They have an insane reserved parking spot system that rewards employees who have been there 15+ years. At one point it was so bad if you weren't at work before 7AM you weren't getting a parking spot and would have to shuttle over. -There is a real lack of accountability. It doesn't matter if you only work 5 hours a day, as long as you are able to man a chair for core hours, you will be receiving a paycheck. I saw people cause multi-million dollar outages through negligence and they were not punished. I never saw anyone getting fired for anything and it was really bad. -Working from home is strictly prohibited, unless you are a contractor. They repeatedly wouldn't allow us to work from home, but at the same time they were willing to allow it for contractors. This felt like regular employees were being punished while contractors were being rewarded. -The on-call rotation was the worst I've ever been a part of in 15 years. When you are on-call expect to be paged at all hours of the night. You won't be able to have a normal weekend because you will be repeatedly paged for the dumbest reasons. -Technical debt is a huge issue at Costco IS. If you're big on 1990s IT concepts this is your place. Things like the cloud were in their infancy and were already being misused at Costco. There was no serious planning, and no vision by anyone in the IT department with any real power. -The pay and benefits were very poor for the Seattle area. This really needs to be addressed because they will have issues recruiting and keeping the quality employees they are going to need to modernize Costco IS. -The Costco IS office space really sucks. My team was in a huge 2 story building that is an extremely large open space. The cubical walls are only about 3 feet tall and people's voices carried for miles. If you were trying to get any serious work done, you would basically be required to buy expensive noise cancelling headphones. The building also featured totally inadequate parking. At one point people parked across the painted line and got towed. It wasn't a good place to go to every day at all. It also smelled like mold in that building, and I wouldn't be surprised if there were some serious problems with it.","-Cheap food at the corporate cafeteria. This may be a negative if you are trying to lose weight, as many, many employees typically gain a lot of weight after starting to work at corporate.

799,Costco,"A very mismanaged, grossly unorganized, and unprofessional company. To explain, let me begin with my interview with them.. I was offered an interview with Costco for a seasonal position at 7am in the morning. I show up early and am led into the food court, where the first of 3 interviews took place. By the time it was all said and done, it was about 11:30 AM in the morning, with the vast majority of my time being spend sitting down and waiting for the next interview. Seemed excessive for a $14 hour position. After my 3rd and last interview, my interviewer tells me “Okay, thank you for your time, we will get in touch with you in the next few days” So I leave and get halfway home, until I get a call to return. I return, as they forgot to issue my drug test. After passing the drug test, I am told to show up for orientation and bring my passport as a form of employment ID. I show up for orientation and am scolded (with the rest of our group) for not bring our social security cards. We were never told to do so, just to bring our passports if we had one. I will now progress into a list format so this doesn’t end up too long: 1) My start date changed 3 times. 2) My orientation was completely unorganized and they could not get the TV to work. They didn't have papers ready and seemed unsure of what to cover with us. 3) I received conflicting schedules on how long I was supposed to stay for my first day of work. 4) I did not receive a first week’s schedule, only to eventually end up with 3 conflicting ones. Online, the one in the breakroom, and one issued by a manager. 5) Show up my second day to get scolded for being late, I explained I followed the schedule a manager issued. 6) Told by my supervisor that he does not micromanage our breaks, but instructed that if they are not taken every exactly 2 hours, you lose them (isn’t that micromanaging?) 7) Computer system is IBM AS400 (Released in 1979 and has not had significant changes since) 8) Was told to go into the office and complete my “training”. I was led there, signed into the computer and was forgotten about for the rest of my day. “Just do the trainings” 9) I was told I would be working in majors (Electronics) and it would be part time and low pressure sales. Ended up being high pressure sales (service plans and TVs) and had a schedule of 45 hours. 10) If a member wanted to buy a display TV, it HAD to be sold on the spot, regardless of how many people were waiting for help. Difficult when you’re on your own trying to repackage a 75” TV by yourself. 11) Was told to carry an iPad with a large, heavy metal case around all day. Was told it was to boost ship to store sales, only to find out that the majority of Costco.com products do not ship to store. What’s the purpose of it then? 12) Next week starts, no schedule issued to me again or posted. I speak to a manager and he gives me a schedule. 13) Next day, told I am early and that the schedule the manager issued was incorrect and he is not allowed to write my schedule. At this point, I still have no idea who I really report to as I have met about 6 different warehouse managers. 14) No simple/streamlined way to turn off/on the display TV’s. Each TV must be managed by hand, kinda hard when they are up high. 15) Costco does not use planograms for merchandise, resulting in a completely incoherent, disorganized layout of merchandise. Everything changes daily, same with the backstock (which is stored up in the steel). 16) Each night, you need to look for the backstock by walking the entire left side of the store, with pen and paper to find it. There is no inventory tracking system. 17) Had a manager call me over, told me to remove a sign, and then had me hand him the sign. He then walked away. Didn’t introduce himself or anything. Not even a “hello”. Some type of way of proving his dominance over me or what? Could have easily done it himself, he was standing right there. 18) Almost everyone that worked there looked unhappy or outright miserable. 19) The ""everyone starts at the bottom"" mentality leads to people who only have their GED and zero management experience being your boss.

877,Costco,"I quit after a month due to a disagreement with management. It is VERY taxing on the body to work here and after a week the managers had ""the talk"" with me that I needed to hurry up or quit, after I had clocked out for the day. Which is illegal since they were forcing me to talk about work after my shift had ended without paying me. Of course, they didn't say that I needed to quit, that's also illegal, but they can imply what they want. One of the rules of Costco is that if you take care of Costco, Costco will take care of you. They treat their employees well, but some don't make the cut due to the physical demands which one of the managers told us on our first day. No ""welcome to Costco"", it was more of a ""Costco isn't for everyone"" while we were still learning about our new jobs. I was scolded for not walking fast enough while looking for carts outside. I found this to be hypocritical when the majority of the orientation was all about being part of the Costco family. Anyway, I quit because the managers told me I was doing a bad job when I was trying my absolute hardest, going home in pain and sore every night, and really trying to make the job work. It was also frustrating that the managers were constantly looking for employees doing something wrong. If you're looking for something going wrong, then you're going to find it and build a bad impression of your employees. I heard several times ""If you've got time to lean, you've got time to clean"". The problem is that the managers don't see the members coming towards my station when I'm waiting for them. If I don't think I can start or finish a cleaning project in the time it takes for a member to reach the cashier station then I'm not going to start one. Finally, most of the employees there don't want to train new people. I would ask for help and get blown off.","The pros to working at Costco are well known. They offer excellent benefits, raises on a regular basis, and 99% of customers are happy so the emotional toll of doing retail isn't really there. Costco is an interesting company to work for because 100% of their profits come from membership subscriptions. They do treat employees well because the corporation wants them to treat their members well. One thing that I really liked about Costco was that while there are little rules here and there that seem odd, there is always a method to their madness.

892,Costco,"Lazy supervisors that make you do their work. You will be told to sweep their area they were working in, bail their trash, stock their stuff, etc while they stand around and talk to each other. Disrespectful supervisors and managers talk to you like you are a child. I get disrespected on a daily basis, even the members talk down to stockers. Do not try to retaliate because they will bully you by doing things passive aggressively so it will be hard to report it. Petty staff that look for reasons to mess with people. For example I had to print out signs but the printer was out of paper. Like how I usually do I was going to replace the paper. I opened up the 2nd tray because that is the one that was out of paper and that prints the type of signs I needed. Some clerical worker/Front end staff gets mad at me and tells me to close it and open the first tray. She says the 1st tray is for letters and I tell her I don't need that one. She then tell me I need the 3rd tray. I showed her it wasn't the right one. Then she says the 2nd tray (the one I had open in the beginning) and she tells me: ""Well, next time look at the screen and learn how to read."" What is crazy about this is that it had nothing to do with her. She was not using the printer and when she saw that she was wrong and I was right from the beginning; she starts throwing out insults. Similar to a lot of people that work at this warehouse she is petty and have a superiority complex and when it got challenged she resorts to insults. There are many more examples like this where people not involved get involve just so they can talk down to you. Another con is how you are treated like a child. You are not allowed to use the restroom unless you are on break. If you use the restroom while not on a break they consider that ""stealing"" from the company. (They told us this at a meeting that was suppose to celebrate our hard work but it was just to yell at all of us because some people don't follow the rules). Good luck getting a break too. There are plenty of times I was forced to skip my 15 minute break to do something for a supervisor. What they do to not get in trouble is they make you stay 15 minutes after your shift so they can say you took your 15. Your schedule will change constantly and if someone takes off then you are going to have your day off taken from you. All they have to do is notify you within 24 hours and they can take it away. They are also very strict on clocking in and out. You have to clock in right on your time not a minute early or that is considered stealing company time. The job is very easy but the managers/supervisors make it complicated by using ambiguous speech. They will tell you: ""Grab that pallet over there"", and there are three pallets over there. If you go back and ask for them to be specific they will yell at you and if you bring back the wrong one they will yell at you. The Supervisors and Managers act like they are better than you and they do not appreciate their employees work. They take advantage of good will and niceness. They even tried to force me to answer math equations to stock and they ended up getting it wrong themselves because the equation they set up was incorrect from the get go. We were forced to go to their once a year meeting. The problem was that it took place at night and people and had to come in early the next morning (4:00 am/etc). They had us work first before the meeting which was a problem for others because they wore clothes that was not fit for work. I wore my regular work attire but others didn't and had to get their good outfits dirty and had to work with out steel toe boots. They should have told people that they would be working. During the meeting they said it is to celebrate our hard work but majority of the meeting was just a lecture on how we don't work hard enough. Never enough supplies, you will have to move pallets by hand sometimes because there are never enough pallet jacks or flatbeds. This place is a nightmare, I have never been disrespected so much at one place. The members talk down to you and so do employees that are higher in the hierarchy. Also never help the cashiers, these people have the nastiest attitudes out of everyone. They are always unhappy and yell at you for any small mistake even though you are helping them. For example, I was helping a manager print sign's and when I was walking back one of the front end cashiers looked at me and said ""Why the **** are these on boards."" Someone had put the boxes at the front on a pallet and she didn't know who; so she chose me to take it out on.",-You get benefits even if you are part time. -Advancement opportunities at other warehouses.,1.0,"""Easy Job made difficult by petty, rude, and lazy Supervisors/Managers"""

985,Costco,"Before I write my cons, I just want to say that every employees time here are different, there's no equality and it really depends on which store you work for as well the managers you work under. I disliked the favoritsm that managers have towards certain employers and when ever I wanted to get cross trained or an opportunity to move out of my position, it felt like I was moved to the side for a newer or favored worker as it took 5 years just to move from morning stocker to night stocker which does not fare well with me as does the many false promises I've encountered. And lastly when I tried transferring to other stores for opportunities, for the most part I was treated like I was worthless despite being there for 12 years at the time.","As a 10 plus year employee at Costco, I can say that the pay, benefits as well as vacation/holiday time are amazing especially for a retail company.

997,Costco,"- Management doesn’t acknowledge you or your hard work - The company motto is “always in a hurry, never rush.” Trust me, you are rushing ALL the time! - You will never work so hard for so little pay anywhere else. - The daily job assignments for seasonal workers appears to be stereotypically gender-based. - The gals are sent to fold clothes for hours, or to straighten socks/underwear/shoes/towels, while guys get to box groceries, do go-backs, collect carts, and help customers. - If you come down with the flu and a fever due to having such close contact with the public during the flu season, they expect you to come to work anyway. Management brags about how they did this when they were sick. - If your flu lasts more than 2 days, you are required to go to the doctor for a note, if you expect to keep your job when you return. If you live alone, this means you drive yourself to the doctor while sick with flu and fever to get the doctor’s note. You pay your medical facility a $40 copay for the doctor’s note which then takes you four hours of work to recoup. What is also baffling is that they expect you to work sick, all the while you deal with the members. This is all unwritten, of course. So much for treating employees and memebers with respect and integrity.",- Starting pay is $2 above minimum wage. - If you have another job while working here...Costco will help you see all the things about it you took for granted and failed to appreciate. - Managers are militant about you taking your breaks and lunch (for legal reasons) - Almost all of your coworkers are hard workers! - The customers are great!. - The company is profitable because employees work at warp speed.,2.0,"""All that glitters is not gold"""
998,Costco,"Racism - heard about every slur in the book (including from my own supervisor), nepotism - I and many others who were more than qualified for internal positions have been overlooked in lieu of friends and family members who were not. Management always looked the other way or just did not care. They say they are ""all inclusive"" but their behavior says otherwise. Unresponsive HR department - no one in the so-called HR department has any power, or even any good suggestions, they always refer you back to management EVEN when the issue IS management! Many times I've heard management talked about how long they would allow new employees to stay on, most being let go one day short of their 90th day as to avoid unnecessary paperwork. This is pretty screwy for a company to act. Avoid any job posting from Monrovia, MD. at all costs...","Good pay, lots to learn",1.0,"""Not an equal opportunity employer"""
