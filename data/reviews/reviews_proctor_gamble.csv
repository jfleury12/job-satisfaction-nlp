They say they do, but never want to actually do what they need to do to make it happen. Typical of the corporate world, a lot of backstabbing goes on. Transparency is something they tout, but do not appreciate or follow. If you call someone out on a PVP violation, they find ways to ding your performance and push you out. Sometimes FMLA requests are gifted with letters from your boss threatening to fire you because you're not there. Science backgrounds are underappreciated and also no longer welcome in the company. Promotions are slow for most and are not given because of performance, but rather how your boss sells you, or how much you suck up. You could have a great career for years, have multiple bosses that have praised you the entire time and give no complaints about you, and then get one person/boss that doesn't like you and your career is screwed- and it doesn't matter if you have been there 5 or 25 years. The people are encouraged to be this way since the company still uses a rating system for performance, which has long been counterproductive. It is only meant to be used as a temporary weed out system but it has been at least 25 years that this system has been in place and is truly no longer effective. Diversity of the mind is also not appreciated, if you don't think like the majority, then they treat you like you're stupid.

You aren't selling something or making something, so there is no objective performance possible. Over the last 24 years I've seen this ratings process as a manager as well as an employee and I can say it's extremely demoralizing and a system that divides and de-motivates employees more than anything else. A single person based on their subjective impression of you can rate you poorly and you have no recourse. That rating impacts potential for promotion, salary today and over the next 2 years, profit sharing, and your image with future managers once you move on to another role.",Proctor & Gamble

The emphasis placed on being a good corporate citizen is not just because it is good for business, it permeates throughout the culture. I don't worry about waking up and seeing P&G's name engulfed in some dubious business scandal. The experiences I have had cover manufacturing, procurement, IT systems, centralized business services, business acquisitions/divestitures and regulatory compliance, to name a few. These experiences have led me to travel across the US and abroad. This is one of the clear advantages of working for a multi-discipline, multi-national company.","The trends of ""agile offices"" (no one has an assigned office/desk) and ""work from anywhere"" (use technology to connect to teams/co-workers versus face-to-face) has eroded some of the company's cohesive culture. Both trends provide flexibility and benefits for P&G and the employee, but we have not figured out how to counteract the effect that a reduction of face-to-face communications has on personal relationships which have been key to our success. Once a leader in African-American employee diversity, P&G took its eye off the ball in the last 10 years and its progress has fallen back. The percentage of African-American employees is lower than the percentage of African-Americans in the US. I might be an outlier, but I have been the only African-American in my work group in the last 8-9 years.",Proctor & Gamble

Generally employees are empowered and trusted (although sometimes trusted too much).","P&G has for a long time had a crisis of ethics. The Company principles and values statement itself is very well constructed and admirable. But it isn't followed. Moreover, it is regularly ignored. Part of the problem is incentives. Due to the rating systems whereby one is strictly rated against departmental peers, loyalty and work to advance a department is rewarded more than work to advance the Company's interests. One might think departmental interests and company interests are one in the same, but often they are not. Departments champion specific projects, often in competition for funding with other departments and projects. Yet there is little to no real incentive to cooperate among departments. As such, Directors strive to advance ""their agenda"" at the expense, sometimes, of the agenda of others. This leads sometimes, to very serious problems such as covering up mistakes and censoring criticism that might reflect badly on departments or the way a department works for the greater corporate interest. Moreover, my experience was that it is very likely that one will literally be punished for pointing out a weakness or shortcoming in a departmental effort even if making that shortcoming known was literally the only way to advance the greater business interest. Of course, these problems have solutions. Higher level management can put in place very specific incentives for inter-departmental cooperation to achieving measurable higher-level corporate goals. It is not hard to do with a little thought. Sadly, during my time at P&G the idea of inter-departmental co-operation was given 'lip service', but was never made seriously actionable. It was fun to work at P&G for many years, but in the end I did not find it to be a company that came anywhere near to realizing it's stated principles and values.",Proctor & Gamble

This company feels directionless and has an unhappy, self-serving culture that is entirely focused on 'whats in it for me.' There are many things cited in many of these reviews that are certainly true - big, slow, bureaucratic, etc etc. I don't quibble with those, they are all true. Fundamentally I think this company is in deep trouble due to a sense of arrogance and entitlement that has seeped into every aspect of the culture. -Leaders talk about a ""right to win"" as though it has been ordained that eventually P&G and its brands will assume their rightful place at the head of the pack and all will be rewarded. -The company has curtailed hiring and has been handing out severance packages in order to try to make earnings figures, no one seems to realize that this results in an aging, like-minded workforce made up of those without the risk tolerance or skills to compete externally. Rather than getting rid of those who don't contribute this is the expensive, cowardly way out. -The value proposition for newer employees is MUCH worse than for those who joined long ago (in terms of advancement, compensation, profit sharing) so the few talented youngsters that do get hired are turning over like crazy. -After buying brands, seeing them stagnate, throwing one CEO under the bus, and bringing AG back for an encore, the Board has embraced ""focus"" as a strategy, selling off what AG put together in the first place. There is no change in culture, process etc underway - just a smaller version of the mess of recent years. I have heard no compelling rationale suggesting this is a winning plan. -When things go right its due to P&G brilliance, when they don't it is always externally driven - devaluation in Venezuela, foreign exchange headwinds etc etc. No accountability at any senior level. -Some people at the VP/Band 6 level have polish but no ideas and are very poor leaders.

The more than 100 year old company was a leader for all industries while humbly ticking along making some of the worlds best consumer products. Now, it has slacked a great deal and investors are on the fence--unsure about the future of P&G. A snap change of CEO's only to go right back to the last one, big bonus payouts to corporate within the last ten years just like every other major corporation milking the system (new for P&G), lazy internal compliance to the corporate values that allow small communities like Lima, Ohio with racial issues ruin the culture for everyone...the moral level (which PG holds sacred) is at an all time low. PG put Bob McDonald in only to introduce sweeping unpopular cuts to pay and a horrific overall of the progression system so he could take the blame, then ousted him to bring AG back as CEO....a ploy to fool investors. The company has been racked with threats of discrimination lawsuits only to settle nearly all of them out of court so investors don't see the true internal struggles. The moral issue has only been inflamed by a reduction in profit sharing investment, lower pay, top heavy management (which threaten the pioneered work system of TEAMS OF HIGHLY TRAINED TECHNICIANS RUN THE PLACE), and a rocky launch and slow acceptance by consumers of the POD technology (Soluble Unit Dose [Tide Pod Tabs]). Profit sharing just 10 years ago was at a 23% company match. It is down to 8%. People used to retire near millionaires if they invested properly, but now, we will never see those days again. Should we? Sure, when you work for one of the world's oldest companies that boast the most billion dollar brands of any company in history. We sure should expect to retire wealthy. Lima, Ohio is a Con in itself. It's drained the life out of the corporate value system and has killed the good PG Vibe that ran through employee's veins. It's a horrible feeling to work here now and job security is, well, uncertain. There are too many managers. Aside from discrimination and racism, the other biggest co is WORK-LIFE BALANCE. There IS NONE for a technician. 12-hr rotating schedules are hard on the body! P&G has conducted several studies and are aware of several scientific studies that prove the body is damaged with this system, yet they still allow employees to vote for it...they do so because of overtime allowances with it.

Life of a young professional here pretty much is dead. Pretty much like the companies in the city Politics-you literally have to spend as much time on actual work, as you do managing your career if you want to get ahead. A lot of brown nosing. Boring work-gets pretty mundane in R&D Work Life Balance-What is that? I worked on average 6 days a week, pulling down 50+ hours. During plant EOs, 18hr days were the norm. At the Researcher position, there is literally no career progression. You get one promotion (Sr. Researcher) for the entirety of your career, and that is it (you do get pay increases). Your engineering friends will out earn you (they start at ~$20K more than you do) and have the career of their dreams, while you are stuck at one position for the rest of your career. But you won't initially be told this. You won't find this out until you go to a onboarding training where they show you the percentages of people at each level, and what percent make it to their desired level in the TCS. Odd TCS placement: There were people with MS/MPHs and other graduate degrees that were at the same level as I was with a BS. Middle Manager Glut-the band 3 manager position is insanely bloated with untalented people, who only seek the money. Not people who know, or want to learn how to manage Company Culture- They talk a good game about managers being flexible, and understanding the needs of their employees. Your section head/AD can literally decree: No flex time and no OT. So I just worked 12hrs, and I am expected to be here tomorrow before 9am? And I won't get pay for that additional 4 hrs I worked? GTF. But you will always have friends in other business units where flex time is the norm. Egos/Hierarchy-It exists. Like, literally the time you go to lunch tells where you are on the totem pole at some R&D sites. Also, the stroking of egos must be done to get ahead. And never outshine your daily coach, in any fashion, you will regret it, because they will feel intimidated. My advise: Go to graduate school, teach, do whatever, cause you won't be happy here. The city is very conservative and not a great place for young people, the company doesn't understand Millennials or what we desire in our careers, I never felt that I was making a difference in the world selling tooth paste, or paper towels.

Results are mostly based on how your 1 up manager views you and assesses your performance. At the plant level, plant managers seem to view you based off of how your 1 up manager and/or plant leadership views you. Also, not much opportunity to solve technical problems with creativity. Often times, you have to follow the P&G way to solve every single problem (which sometimes is overkill and wasteful). If there is any real engineering work to be done, contractors usually take care of it. Manufacturing engineers focus primarily on process reliability (compiling data, eliminating machine stops, etc.) without really diving in too technically (i.e. minimal design work). To top it off, managers working in the plant level are expected to work minimum 50-60 hours/week, so the P&G mentality can become draining (which is why I left).",Proctor & Gamble

There are also generous opportunities to learn. The benefits package has historically been superior. Many talented people work for P&G. Top management - with some exceptions and with many bumps along the road - knows how to execute to win in the market. Overall, I am confident P&G will endure and succeed for its' stockholders (and I am one of them). However growth will likely be slow.","The simple truth is that the stated core values of the Company are essentially not followed by - I daresay - most employees. This may not have always been true, but I believe this is a ""built in"" problem created by ""the way the system works"". The internal culture will not admit mistakes and basically people are force-rated by their colleagues who are organized into departmental 'silos'. The basic motivations are tribal: to protect one's own group and ""fiefdom"" within the organization. But - as a ""value"" - this isn't the same thing as working for the greater good of the Company itself. So when mistakes are made (as they inevitably are), they are often covered up. It gets worse insofar as long as you fabricate a positive result for ""the good of the group"" you can literally be rewarded even though almost everyone knows what you claim just can't be so. I tried to talk about this with my management and I was repeatedly told - basically - to just go away. Many true-believer employees believe that P&G can do no wrong. They also think loyalty means doing whatever you are told (even if it is both unethical and bad for the Company n the long run). These people tend to stay. In effect, they make up the core of the Company. So a lot of unethical practices and internal manipulation of data is just laughed off, or called an ""opportunity for improvement"" (with a smile as if to say - we know it really won't be improved). If it were only a few cases of such behavior, given the talent at the Company and the long-term rewards, a reasonable person might just decide to overlook these cultural problems. However, at P&G, you can do well without being ethical or fair and many people know it. Then, core values become deeply eroded when there is really no punishment for violating them and people know it. Over time one learns the company is far more fearful of negative publicity than internal dishonesty. So the structure of rewards, ratings, and organization means a certain level of dishonesty is literally advantaged. For me, over time, this was a real problem. It affected my sleep, my work, and my sense of pride. I am glad to have left.",Proctor & Gamble

Highly rated D level employees are now doing work that was classified as Band 2 (two BIG promotions above D) as recently as a year ago. Often times leadership considers employees ready for management level work and responsibility, but not ready for management level pay. Additionally, lackluster employees are given too much slack and are often passed from organization to organization. This leaves top performers picking up the slack from layoff's as well as carrying some of their dead weight teammates.

Total compensation is good to above average. Base salary + benefits + vacation/holidays + profit sharing is an overall very competitive package, especially after 5+ of employment. Pay raises are consistent, usually annual. And in general, work-life balance is good, but it greatly depends on the type of role you have. But P&G leadership overall supports a family atmosphere; whether it's big or small events or issues that you or your family are going through, they will work with you as much as possible. Our PVPs (principles, values, purpose) are lived everyday. It's not just a saying. Without them P&G would just be any other large corporation. And if you take the intuitive, you can build an amazing mentor network throughout the company, within many leadership levels. It's invaluable. Overall, P&G is part of my life, but not my whole life. Plus I have been able to support a very comfortable life for my family and I, and I value (and feel valued) for my contribution to the company.","Yes, your working for P&G, but in the beginning of your carrier your really working for (and hired for) a specific location. This is especially true in manufacturing- each one is a company it itself. Newer managers (millennials and Gen Y new hires) can be frustrated by this. A general expectation is to do 3+ roles (~2yrs per role) before getting support to apply for roles at another city or site. Just make sure you understand the expectations before you accept your offer. Perks- no traditional perks such as bonuses until a Band 3 position. Profit sharing %'s have dwindled for new hires over the past 10 years, which is a shame since this is the biggest financial incentive to stay with the company for your entire working career... Especially since there is no matching 401k contribution. Plus, profit sharing is 100% P&G stock, which has been flat for 7 years. Career planning: you have to learn the delicate balance of leading it yourself, without being pushy and unrealistic. And lastly, the consumer products business sometimes isn't the most exhilarating... We're not producing Porsche's or iPhones here. We aren't located in the most exciting cities, and we honestly haven't really had any big innovations in a while. But we are 'stable', in a world that seems to be constantly moving forward.",Proctor & Gamble

I told my management that I would do the best I could to ensure that all the work was completed. I was written up because they told me that ""I will do my best"" was taken the wrong way.... WHAT? How is that statement taken the wrong way? There is only one way to take that statement and it is definitely a positive statement. Especially when I volunteered to cover the extra work?

Leadership is horrible here, they believe that they are actually smarter than technicians because they went to college. So they look down upon them. Sad thing is many technicians have gone to college and earned a engineering degree or business degree, or an it degree, but just chose a different path. That is also aggravating. Leadership is clueless to those who deserve promotions versus those whom they ""like."" We have a high turnover here, because people are frustrated with so many things.

While this is nice and all, the company does not consistently maintain this philosophy throughout the organization or through all levels. The hierarchy system is institutionalized as a way of life - ie, you can get your hand slapped for emailing your boss' boss directly - where managers at each level are not to be questioned or challenged. The onus is on the employee to manage their managers regardless of the managers competence, engagement in developing the employee, or experience. I had 5 different managers at P&G and only 1 of them was decent. Because P&G does not have a culture that questions authority and does not hold people accountable as a result, mediocrity is the new bar that is set and continuously lowered as this becomes more ingrained into the culture. Blatant policy violations, overspends, etc are covered up and individuals responsible are given the same high praise as others who exceed expectations and over deliver. It's an incredibly de-motivating experience - and the lack of accountability creates this penetrating sense of job security so no matter how mediocre a person, they know they will always have a safe place in the company. P&G also has extremely limited to no transparency regarding topics like career planning, where you move, what role you do, and what function you work in regardless of strengths or passions. The decisions are made behind a curtain and planned out for you. I moved three times in 5 years - each time not one person took into account my feedback on preferences or role preferences. The sales culture is one of intensive brain washing - everyone drinks the kool aid and cannot imagine leaving the company despite high levels of dissatisfaction. Few do.

Large Size & Scale means it does take a long time to get things done. Focus on productivity leading to less people doing more work. Definitely leading to a lessinging in quality of the work and quality of work life balance.

The fantastic work/life balance is what really drew me in. I didn't mind working above & beyond all the time because the company was allowing me the work/life balance that allowed me to enjoy what really mattered in life while still growing my career. In fact, it made me want to give even MORE of myself because I was so grateful. However, I switched managers a few years ago and this new manager does NOT support work/life balance (even though we're a strong group that constantly exceeds results/expectations).

1963,"""Once a great company that should get back to its initial winning culture""",3.0,"Great company & great people to work with. P&G is a company that has invested disproportionate in the systems, business process and people training so you can find a lot of mastery in almost all fields of work ; therefore, P&G represent firstly a huge opportunity for new hires who find themselves on a steep learning curve in their first years in the company. Also, the staffing and succession planning is usually very well done so you barely have time to get into in the comfort zone in your current role and you find yourself moving to a new assignment. This helps a lot on the personal growth part. Another pro is that P&G is a leading worldwide company with great brands , being year after year in the top 10 most wanted employers, which gives a sense of pride. Also the grow from within policy, brings the confidence that there are no ""outside"" factors to limit your career as long as you do good. Good compensation and benefits package.","The main issue comes from the fact that the culture and values have changed in the last period (although no one claims this) hurting in a negative way the organization (from a capability point of view). The main change comes from that the company is no longer appreciating ""data based & intellectual honest "" opinions but ""positive thinking"" in the most broader way possible. People are hurrying therefore to claim huge benefits and exceptional results behind flawed projects which start a ticking bomb bringing complexity to the lower levels or even damaging the business. This change of culture came with another change in employee assessment , by moving the focus from performance to image and as image is a variable in strong connection with upper-level networking , nepotism became quite spread in P&G. You can find yourself , therefore, on a good or a very good career path under one manager just to become medium to low when reporting to another, in disconnection with the level of your performance. Another con is that top management tend to cluster and defend , despite the obvious, a manager that gets negative feedback from its reports, especially those related to behavior. This habit has usually led to abuse-like behaviors especially at the upper levels (associate director and up) due to the nature of extreme constraint policy that some managers decide to use for their organizations.

1975,"""P&G""",2.0,Paycheck. If you play the game right you can get paid much more than you should for being pretty incompetent. There is no accountability for screwing things up. Actually you may even get a promotion out of it. So if you are good at passing the buck you will fit right in.,Politics of a large company.
