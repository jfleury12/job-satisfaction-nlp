Stifling suppression and discouragement of innovative and creative thinking by micro meddling managers in fear of better ideas by people under their supervision and compelled by their personal insecurities and egos to impose their own will no matter what. A toxic and oppressive atmosphere, incomprehensible incompetence and lack of accountability, double standards and hypocrisy, favoritism and nepotism. Inadequate communication among peers and non at all between upper management and us lower tier drones. ""Need to know"" information depensed reluctantly by power tripping managers only after a crises occurs because we weren't told in advance. Most feedback is negative. Hardly any positive reinforcement nor encouragement. I received no performance reviews in 9 years and only 2 thereafter. Motivation by intimidation and threat of termination. No Human Resources presence at the store level. Definitive written policies &amp; procedures have been hard to find for lower tier retail people so they don't know when their rights and priveleges are being abused. Corporate personnel were often in the store but they might as well be in another world walking around distant and aloof, dismissing us hourly workers as peons. Ludicrous policies &amp; procedures mandated by clueless corporate clowns with no regard to the operational nightmares they created on the sales floor that actually aggravated the customer experience. Schedules changed every week and every day of every week and posted in as little as 36 hours in advance. ""Full Time"" doesn't mean 40 hours/week, as little as 30hrs/week. With few exceptions only management and associates with decades of seniority can expect 40 hour weeks. My accrued vacation hours disappeared after Albertsons merged with Safeway in 2016 and neither management nor Human Resources could or would fix it. My experience at Albertsons bespeaks a company that will treat their retail grunts in the trenches like trash and arrogantly presume we don't have the courage, will or savvy to challenge them.",Albertsons

Sometimes you don't even have time for your break at all. Customers are super rude (which isn't the company's fault, but if a customer complains about you, the managers will believe them and you'll be the one in trouble). If you get a second job, the manager will go to great lengths to give you ridiculously less hours.

The direction and strategy of the company are no longer clear and have not been since Josh Hix, the old CEO and founder, left. Things are haphazardly implemented just for the sake of showing some kind of development, even if it does not drive overall growth. 7. The new head of the company, who was put in place by the parent company, is hardly ever present in the NY office and it appears that support for Plated internally in the parent company is dwindling.

There is a lack of structure and the entire structure seemed to have been done reactively, rather than proactively.

Work from home is discouraged. Flexible work schedules are discouraged. Internal processes are rigid, inflexible and outdated. Management pretends to listen to concerns but does nothing about it. IT infrastructure is dominated by creaky, expensive, ancient mainframe systems. IT is seen as a cost center not a center of innovation. Contrast that with successful companies like Amazon where IT is a key player and they actually invest in IT. Company is shouldering an enormous amount of debt which limits their ability to compete with the likes of Amazon (via Whole Foods) and WalMart. Stores are closing left and right and management has no answers to compete in the modern business environment. In IT you will learn lots of useless non-transferable skills. If you are looking to build skills in anything developed in the last 10-15 years this is not the place for you. Culture is a passive-aggressive political minefield.

PAY - small & didn't change, per management there would be NO increases ever.. Funny how the store with the highest sales in town can have the worst pay & lowest staffing, with no increase in sight - Numerous issues with getting paid and finding someone who understands how to do any of it live or online. - Most recently (today), they were upset and terse with me on the phone for simply asking for a copy of my W2 or instructions on how to get it online. WORK - Very demanding (Not for the pot-head slacker that they usually hire) - They did not understand time management or limitations based on simple factors like a truck being 4 hours late leading to late stocking FACILITY - Other than the 4-bulb fluorescent light fixture that was hanging from the ceiling by its wires after the ceiling got water logged, there are at least a dozen places with leaks throughout the store with buckets under them after rain or ice thaw - The floor was redone during work hours throwing cement dust into the air and making so much noise you couldn't hear a cashier SCREAM how much your bill was. - The bathrooms public & store employee only are always in completely unsanitary condition. Mostly since the store is a homeless-wino magnet, (No exaggeration here, meth heads shoot up in the bathroom, drunks pass-out in the entryway, just ask any employee) Management - All but the store manager are completely incompetent, condescending, rude and have one of 2 extremes, complete introverted social akwardness, or megalomania (lucky for the God complex ones, the ""Trump nation"" may allow them to excel) SAFETY - Again, the electrical and ceiling issues (controlled y the landlord), are an ever present problem - Homeless and just regular thief types are always with you, especially fun at 3 AM - Not only are the bathrooms unsanitary, but stock on the shelves may sit behind fresher stop in front for YEARS, and when a cooler/freezer breaks the remedy is questionable at best - Lets not forget that your vehicle WILL be broken into and or hit by another vehicle (Sometimes the very delivery truck you will be un-stocking) because the lot is small, has steep inclines and little room for maneuvering - If you are green and choose to ride a bike, it too will be stolen or vandalized if too difficult to steal by the meth heads",Albertsons

After I got cussed at I finished my shift that day and never went back to work there after that. Not too long after I decided to leave that Albertson’s closed down and either the employees had to find new work or transfer to a Safeway or other Albertson’s location.

519,"""Baker""",1.0,"The bakery manager was clearly working hard and doing her best with a bad situation; the other folks in bakery were fun to work with in that commiserating colleagues kind of way. I took this job to get better at baking. While it did nothing for my mixing and prepping skills or any basic knowledge, it did improve my timekeeping skills. The pay was just above minimum wage for Oregon (9.89/hr I believe, vs. 9.75/hr). I did not stay long enough to find out what the union benefits were or if the job came with any health or retirement benefits (I highly doubt it). On the plus side, after this job, I know which grocery chains I do not wish to support as a customer, given the quality of their goods and how they treat their employees.","Being a bakery, the hours are brutal. First week there, I was assigned the 3am-12pm shift, with an hour ""lunch"" break in the middle. This was commercial, not from-scratch baking: everything came in pre-mixed and frozen, and the bakers only opened packages and put items in the oven. (If you were lucky, you got to decorate some.) I was told they get a lot of turnover from employees who thought it would be a scratch-baking job; if they actually cared about reducing turnover, you'd think they'd mention it in the interview. This is not a job about mixing and baking: it is about timing and packaging. Constantly understaffed and overburdened, running on old and faulty equipment, we still had to be working at top speed and quality to achieve even the basic expectations on the floor. The store gives great weight to the few customer reviews that they get, and with few exceptions, upper management does not take into account other issues (e.g. understaffing and faulty equipment) that lead to, for instance, donuts coming out late or not being decorated nicely enough. On that note, upper management is very disconnected from on-the-floor employees, and it seems they have little sympathy for how hard these lower-grade jobs actually are. I took this supposedly part-time job to make ends meet while searching for work in my actual field. I was given full-time hours, had to purchase my own uniform, had great difficulty getting my paycheck, and by noon everyday, I was left too exhausted to do anything else with my time. The pay was far, far too low to justify the toll on my health and time. Everyone I met there, in and out of bakery (with the possible exception of store management and HR), seemed stressed and depressed. The people who work these jobs are the ones who have to; this company seems to take advantage especially of middle-aged workers and single mothers, people who can't afford to quit and look for other work because they are being paid so little in the first place. The break room was dreary, covered in Safeway/Albertson's advertisements, and smelled like mold. The branded radio station was mind-numbing, and by the end of 3 days, I had the painfully chipper Safeway/Albertson's ads memorized. The dress code was demeaning, restrictive, and expensive... they only recently, ""generously"" allowed men to have long hair and beards. (Keep in mind, Ashland is a college town full of hippies; long hair, piercings, and unusual tatoos are practically staples of the culture.)

So I wouldn't find it discouraging. My advice to a potential new hire is to not get invested in any politics or engage in the drama within these doors too much. But all in all, I highly doubt all branches are the same. With anything, make your own opinion. I started out at 9.60 and within the first six months, you get a raise, and at a year you get another raise. After a year with them, I think I left making 10.60. You bottom out at 11.

Standard of practice doe put patients first no matter the situation you are able to always do what is best and right for the patient.,"The new computer system update is not sufficient to provide the level of service and care that patients need in pharmacy. It was the biggest downgrade, worse than my imagination could even dream. 4 weeks after conversion what used to take 3 minutes still took almost 20 to 25 minutes to complete. It is a disappointment because the sense of urgency and ability to complete the task of filling a prescription in less than 5 minutes was what made our pharmacies shine and set them a step or more above the competition. After the conversion the efficiency level decreased so drastically due to the system there is absolutely not a chance to make the system do what the old system was capable of without a complete overhaul of the program. It was the worst business decision in pharmacy ever made. Taking away the old system from the pharmacy and adding the new one and telling the staff to make it work and expect them to succeed is not achievable without a complete program overhaul. The system upgrade will hurt not only the staff but the patients because the pharmacies is under so much pressure mistakes are likely to occur at higher frequency. The conversion created an unsafe work environment because efficiency is what is expected and the major tool that created shining pharmacies was taken away and that is not acceptable for a business that concerns patient safety at the level that pharmacy requires. When it comes down to it doing the right thing for every patient will not out shine the bottom line, being gross margin. Patients lives will be at stake at the cost of increasing the gross margin and the system conversion proves that the gross margin is more important than patients which not acceptable in the business of pharmacy. Patient safety and best interest outweighs every aspect of pharmacy it's the reason the business exists. If the potential risk of the medication outweigh potential benefits the prescription is not filled period, unless the prescriber approves filling knowing the risks involved and the patient accepts the prescription with knowledge of risks as well. That is the first check and the sale only happens if the risks are accepted so the sale isn't above patient safety therefore gross margin isn't above patients. In closing with two questions how is it possible to make a decision to complete a system conversion for hundreds of pharmacies that takes away the tool that gives the pharmacies an ability to be accurate and efficient while keeping patients and safety of medication use at the core of the business practice and why did this decision occur?",Albertsons

One thing I have noticed since I returned is the discount on goods in the store (5%-10%). I was originally an Albertson's employee based in Ft. Worth for 7 years back in the 90's and mistakenly took a transfer to a Jewel-Osco in Skokie, IL in 2000. The coworkers from Albertson's compared to the coworkers at Jewel-Osco was almost like night and day. Albertson's coworkers were awesome once they knew which direction everyone was going and acted as a team in order to get there. The coworkers at the Schaumburg, IL Jewel-Osco location seem good and appear to be run down in moral (sometimes).","With the coworkers at Jewel-Osco at the Skokie, IL location there were a few spiteful individuals who would throw you under the bus before looking in your direction. The entire system is ridiculous on how things are running. I know each division has it's quirks and are set in their ways with a ""No, don't change our way of doing things"" type of policy. For example - There's no accountability with Jewel-Osco in order to evaluate a cashier (1 cash drawer with 3 to 10 cashiers working from it), but Albertson's (going back to the 90s) had accountability where there was 1 cashier to 1 cash drawer, so, instead of evaluating 1 cashier you have to evaluate the 3 to 10 cashiers. Another thing I find odd is that with Jewel-Osco (and from the new Albertson's) you MUST be apart of the union or you won't be hired. Going back to 2000, you didn't have to be apart of the union, but if the employees walked you had to as well.

You could ask one manager, get an answer, and then you could get another answer from a different manager. (This is about serious, warehouse-affecting things like sending 180 cases of ibuprofen instead of 20, and then they wonder why inventory is always so messed up. When a lazy employee asks what to do, and gets an obviously wrong answer from the first manager, I bet they don't try to find a halfway competent response from someone else. They just do the wrong thing resulting in aisles overflowing with product.) You can't trust much of what you're told. During the hiring process, they told everyone in my orientation class that the schedule was set for the year, we'd work four ten hour shifts, and overtime is available if you want it. On my first night, our shift was moved back, and we had to work a few hours of mandatory overtime (and this happened almost every single night I worked there including one 16 hour night). Within a few months, we were told the schedule was changing, so we'd all be working five ten hour shifts (which were generally 12-14 hour shifts rather than ten, but they still call them tens), and then they took the set schedule away in favor of putting up weekly schedules in the break room. Management complained about workers going to the bathroom outside of break times in pre-shift meetings. They hired me for one job and put me in a job I wasn't comfortable with after a few weeks. Despite multiple requests to be put back (and assurances that they would), they wouldn't do it. Your job is dependent on production numbers, and yet the people in the office who put the production sheets into the system often mess up the numbers, and you'll sometimes see petty politics playing out by way of people in the office intentionally putting numbers in wrong, making someone's production lower than it should be (or higher than it should be). The whole thing is a mess. It's one of those jobs you only want to stay at as long as you need it, and you should only take if you don't have another option. The demanding work is fine, but the constant issues and disrespect that came from the management in the warehouse I worked in made it a very toxic situation.

Holiday pay is a joke Staying open for most of the day on a Holiday is depressing The shoppers/rude people. The broken machines. I.e. Dicer has been broken for over a year and glues together more than once. Handle on the freezer door doesn't even exist. The favoritism.

Middle management is usually three things: at least moderately competent, flexible, and jaded with life. This makes them better at doing their job than upper management, and better and commiserating with lower level associates.","Upper management from corporate is out of touch with reality. Upper management in store is frequently incompetent and/or lazy, and passes the burden of their work down the totem pole. Whatever training corporate gave an associate is generally house-ruled and overwritten by the lack of labor funds. Labor is always insufficient and this conflicts with the company's mission statement to provide the best customer service in the industry. In-store management uses the emphasis on associates functioning as a ""team"" as an excuse to be lazy or disproportionately reallocate labor. Raises are small (another reviewer mentioned 10 cents, this is correct, and per 1000 hour review periods). Advancement opportunities are inconsistent, capricious, and arbitrary. Our new store director installed his buddy as the new head of service deli when the deli's manager left on maternity, even though a very qualified associate was next in line and she was already familiar with the duties involved. Then, when the lobby management position opened up, he told the then senior lobby associate that he was a great candidate but that it ""wasn't his turn."" I had previously applied for the same position the last time it opened up and was told by the previous store director that I'd be hired instantly if I would just quit school. I've been informally offered jobs in almost every department in the store including management, but never promoted once in four years. Although the company believes in diversity, I've seen every kind of bigotry imaginable working here: race wars written on the _associate_ bathroom stalls (as well as sexist comments about the promiscuity of associates), and all manner of verbal comments and differential treatment of associates and customers based on ethnicity, religion, and race. Not sure if that's a reflection of the company or just my local demographic. Safety protocol and training in such is apparently optional. Distribution, for whatever reason, seems to think it's a great idea to ship palettes to stores with the heaviest items on top and the most fragile/compressible ones on bottom. The company has good policies in place protecting associates from shoplifters, but does not seem to care about prosecuting shoplifters, even when habitual alcohol theft is commonplace, sometimes upwards of $200 per shoplifter.

Downtime is the best, a good time to get to know your colleagues and the latest news around the store. They pay their cashiers at a generous starting rate of $8.50/hr, though wages will obviously differ depending on what district you work for.
