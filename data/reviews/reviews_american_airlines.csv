86,"""Unfortunately Overworked""",4.0,Amazing flight benefits - it was a great way to explore the world!,"I worked for AA in the administration department in PHX &amp; transferred to ORD 2 years ago. This transition was like night &amp; day. When I first started with the company, I had every intention of retiring with them - that is how much I believed in the company’s mission “going for greAAt”. Everyone in PHX that I worked with displayed this mentality &amp; it reflected in a collaborative team work environment. Although the work expected didn’t align with the pay they offer, that aspect didn’t bother me so much since I always felt they offered AMAZING benefits. Unfortunately, the company morale from PHX isn’t consistent with how ORD is run. Fast forward to life at ORD - the only reason why I choose to leave the company. During my short 2 year career in Chicago, I’ve grown to realize how the Administration Management staff didn’t utilize their resources available, nor did they offer any career development/goals. There was no team collaboration, and most importantly no type of support in my current roll within the Admin department. Monthly meetings were cancelled for more than a year, innovational ideas weren’t entertained, nor was there any flexibility with our schedules. Although I was given a position I didn’t even apply for, I thrived in it. Management saw this &amp; continued to delegate more &amp; more tasks making my current workload biased &amp; unreasonable. When I started to feel the “burn out” I asked for assistance. To my surprise, management wouldn’t provide any. I was laughed at &amp; told that “I had everything under control &amp; it didn’t seem like I needed any help”. So I continued to thrive &amp; make the most of everyday. After-all, where could I find another job with such great benefits? Less than a month ago, we had a death in the family. I made the choice to separate from the company when I was told by management that my absences would be counted as unauthorized since I needed more than 3 days to grieve. This wasn’t the culture that I knew to be true at American &amp; choose to no longer subject myself to these type of working conditions. I get this is how most major corporations function, but their motto “going for greAAt” should be instilled within their Management &amp; displayed consistently regardless of which department/HUB they’re from.",American Airlines

Never made sense to me how you can pay someone the same amount of money when one agent is qualified for ramp, ops, cargo, ticket counter, and gate operations and another is qualified ramp only.

Will have to work a 3am shift every now and then. unless you have been with the company a while and have enough senority to pick a good schedule then you will get horrible schedules and probably wont have time for a trip or to travel because they will make your last work day a night shift so you cant fly after work and your first shift a morning shift and they will overlap schedules so you cant trade. Sometimes the company needs superivsors or managers, and they have interviews inhouse, It's nice that the company promotes within but the downfall is they always pick someone and alot of the time they pick to pick because they need someone immediately to fill the vacancy not because they are the best but because they need someone to work the hours. That's why there are soo many terrible unprofessional managers and supervisors at AA. Paychecks will always be small when you start and for 6 years after. The whole airline senority thing is outdated, the people who have been there the longest are also the most tired, the most fed-up, the rudest, the snobbiest, the most payed and they don't even lift their own bags onto the carousel, the ones that have the highest senority are holding the company back from being the best airline I say force them to retire if they cant lift even one bag and let the millenials create the new fresh face airline. Your senoir coworkers will be the rudest to passengers. Sucks lifting bags up to 99 pounds. Back hurts and feet hurt.

Visas and Passport stuff changes overnight and if you get something wrong the company gets $20,000 fine and you get written up, people that work for Target get paid more than American Airline employes and they have less responsiblity. if you are a new girl the other girls will give you a hard time, especially the agents that have been there since 1987 who started working after they went to high school they are the worst and never matured or did anything else in their life so they have no true experience they literally just bully you. One lady complained on my skirt to a manager and I had to get it measured and I was told to lift and show the original seams of the skirt. Once my manaher said ""yeah looks like its the original skirt and you didnt make any alterations, I guess it looks tooo good on you. the other girls were saying they could see your panties."" lets say company has no tact and this is just one of the many stupid things you have to go through.

733,"""Culture and Work are Uninspiring""",1.0,Working for an airline provides flight benefits which encourages you to travel more than you would otherwise.,"The company has no corporate leadership development strategy which leaves a vacuum that is filled by an inconsistent and often nepotistic/good-old-boy culture that promotes mainly based personal connections or similar backgrounds. The idea that the airline industry is so unique and therefore has nothing to learn from outside is pervasive and deeply rooted. People new to the company/industry are expected to do menial work and not contribute meaningfully until they've been with the company for several years and are reliably parroting back the company line. This hurts the company in multiple ways, primarily in stifling innovation and efficiency improvements and also by killing employee engagement and trust. Many very skilled and talented people leave the company within their first few years, severely limiting the company's talent pool from which to fill leadership positions. This combined with the leadership development vacuum leads to a less skilled/experienced/capable leadership corps and prevents a culture of trust from taking hold. Travel benefits are standby which can seriously limit your options or leave you stranded and forced to pay very high walk-up fares. Employees tend to be compensated less than they would be for comparable roles in other industries, and the flight privileges are frequently highlighted as being intended to fill the gap.",American Airlines

Their attendance policy is shady and since they are not unionized, they can do whatever they want. For me...I never call in sick or late, but they have a (leave early) system if you ask and they dont think its too busy they will let you leave early...its called TL (Time leave). I requested TL 4 days in a row..they approved it....then, a week later they rescinded the approval because (apparently) I didn't sign up correctly so they gave me FOUR POINTS (the same as calling in sick 4 xs)...even though I never missed any work. One time a soldier coming home from WAR on a WAR SHIP, called to change his reservation because the (WAR) ship was late getting back. It was 1200.00 more.....I had to BEG a supervisor to not charge him anything...but nope...she did bring it down to $400.00 (FOUR HUNDRED)....(Southwest airlines would never charge one of our soldiers like that...EVER!).American Airlines.. is the worst company I have ever worked for..",American Airlines

VERY frustrating and it makes it easy to get fired even if you’re a great employee. For example, you can only get a certain number of points for calling in sick or being late (and it’s not very many) and then you get put on a “level” and once you’re on a level it’s very easy to get fired. You acquire sick time, but are then penalized for using it. I had to come into work yesterday with a fever and super sick even though I have sick time because if I use it then it’ll cost me a point. Now my kids are sick and I can’t send them to daycare and I can’t call in sick for them or there goes a point. Also, when I was first offered the job I told management about a wedding that I was a bridesmaid in but since you’re on probation for the first 120 days you’re not allowed to have people cover for you EVEN IF THEY CAN AND WANT THE HOURS so I obviously didn’t go to work and lost a point. It just seems like there’s no empathy or understanding and I had this day marked in my calendar long before I applied for the job. Lastly, I got into a car accident on my way to work and lost another point. I’m normally 30-45 minutes early to work and because of a few incidents over a four month period I’m on the last straw before I’m put on a level.

Problem is...there is no getting ahead because of the seniority system. And by the way....after you put in 25 years or so...they will merge with another airline and a pilot with less longevity than you will ""leapfrog"" you on the seniority list.

Typically, you get more than that. You are able to fly for free when you are off, as long as there is an extra seat on the flight. You can take advantage of this and travel the world. If you are a travel bug, this is the job for you.","Basically, you get paid very little. It raises some every year, but not based on performance, just on seniority. Seniority is everything. As the years progress, you may actually get a planned out schedule each month, but until then be ready to fly by the seat of your pants. You are on call each day and have to be ready to fly in an hour's time at any given time. You make very little money starting out because you only get paid for flight hours. This means that you only get paid when the door of the airplane is shut. So checkins, waiting for planes, waiting for connections, the time you work boarding passengers, and deplaning is all done for free. You could work a 12 hour day, but technically only get paid for 5-6 flight hours. You also have to move to your base, because commuting is extremely hard to do. You end up living almost three separate lives. 40% of time in the air, 20% of time at the places you layover, and 40% of time spent waiting for your next flight in your ""base city"" or on your off days visiting family and friends.

Sometimes you may be at work 16 hours and then only get a 9 hour rest break /layover. The worst part is you aren't getting paid for the full 16 hours you were on duty. You are only paid for the hours and minutes the aircraft is actually moving. The travel benefits have become increasingly worthless. It is the main reason people go to work for the airlines in the first place. But today with the Internet being used as a last minute clearing house - every flight is full every day of the week to every destination - making your travel benefits very difficult to use if you are able to use them at all - and you will be sitting in a middle seat in Coach if at all. Deteriorating work rules and labor contracts have really destroyed what was once a proud occupation. Employees used to receive Pensions. Those were ""frozen"" in 2012 Chapter 11 Reorganization and Retiree Health Care was also jettisoned. You are better off working for another industry with better pay and just purchase your tickets. You can fly today for under $ 300 round trip to just about anywhere. Soon the airlines will pay the public to travel !!!! Retiree Travel has also been downgraded. As a 30 year employee I have enough seniority to make the job tolerable for the next few years until I reach retirement age - but I would never, ever recommend anyone going to work for this airline unless you are being hired directly into an Executive Level position.

They are so disorganized that during the process I was starting to think this was a scam because I could not believe a company this large could continue to operate this way. During the interview/hiring process, several of us asked about scheduling and we were told repeatedly that the hiring and training departments did not handle the schedule and we would ""deal with that later"". We were also told that training would be 2.5 days so we all made arrangements based on that information. We did not receive final confirmation of training until Sunday afternoon letting us know that training would start the next day for a full week. I thought it might be a misunderstanding (based on the 2.5 days previously mentioned), and figured I would ask in person. First day of training, we find out it is actually 2 full weeks. The first week we were there anywhere from 2-4hrs a day, doing absolutely nothing while the ""trainers"" were in and out of the classroom. The O'hare ""trainers"" know absolutely nothing, not figuratively, they literally had no information about anything. Finally at the end of the week we start working on lessons online. At the end of week 1 we finally receive a bid sheet with numbered slots to fill out and they let us know shifts are all 5hrs a day, 5 days a week and granted based on seniority. Up to this point, none of us had any idea what the required hours or days were. This is when they explain that scheduling is not flexible at all, you are required to work whatever shift they award you. The CAR position is new to AA and therefore not fully staffed. This means, you will have to bid frequently (approx every 5 weeks) as they ""play around"" with the schedule to determine what works best for them. Every bid has had different start times, end times, lunch schedules and days off. It has been completely inconsistent. Week 2, We have out of town trainers come in, they are awesome and share valuable information. Unfortunately, we only had them for a couple of days. Once they were gone, we were back at the mercy of the O'hare ""trainers"". The lack of information does not stop there, once you are out on the floor you will find that nobody has an answer to any of your questions. It takes an act of God to receive your uniforms from the vendor. The vendor will blame AA and AA will blame the vendor. You will go back and forth until you give up all hope of having a uniform. Good luck getting an answer from the attendance department if you have an issue with the new system they just switched to. Also, once you work here, forget about making any plans or having a life because, even though you are part time (25hrs /week) you might not receive your bid until a few days before the new schedule starts. How hard is it to have a bid prepared at least a week in advance?",American Airlines

Then, get bumped repeatedly until you give up. All this, after you went to the trouble of getting the time off. Your family [or a travel companion] are also on different 'tiers' than employees, so they could likely end up on a different flight than you or you are forced to change plans.

Another area the airline has excelled is in diversity. They have a broad inclusive non-discrimination policy.,"The quality of work life, i.e. schedule flexibility and the travel benefits - the reason most of us went to work for the airlines to begin with are rapidly disappearing. The company has reneged on it's promises to employees repeatedly. In Bankruptcy reorganization - the Company tried to ""terminate"" pensions and hand them over to the PBGC. Fortunately the Obama Administration said NO - and American was forced to ""freeze"" pensions instead. In any case - Pensions are a thing of the past. The small 3% 401k match doesn't come close to making up for it. Many employees made working for the airline a career - thinking that they would continue to receive lifetime travel passes that they could use in retirement. American also recently reneged on this commitment to employees by downgrading retiree travel considerably - making it almost impossible to get on a flight during retirement with virtually every flight being oversold every day of the year. In addition to all this, as if it wasn't enough, the pay is atrocious. Your pay will NOT keep pace with the rate of inflation, let alone exceed it. Plan on a continually declining standard of living in terms of real purchasing power the longer you work here. In Summation: Do NOT make American Airlines a career. The price you pay for working here is too high and the benefits do not exceed the grueling work and bad pay.",American Airlines
