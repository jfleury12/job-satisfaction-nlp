Most of my co-workers worked with high integrity.,"Centene has experienced a rapid growth over the past couple of years, a growth that they have continuously been ill-equipped to handle. A very reactive corporation, who is more concerned with climbing the Forbes list than they are with the people who support them. Favoritism and lack of integrity among Management and Leadership. This energy trickles down from the overall practices of Centene, in which pending public lawsuits and violations are pending for the growing organization. No work-life balance and no one truly advocated for the people who had their boots on the ground, engrossed in the day to day. Worked into anxiety, stress, depression, and calls for assistance was dismissed.",Centene

The number of contract terminations and sanctions against the company are disturbing. Plan presidents have commented in the past that it is cheaper to pay the sanction than to fix the related problem. Instead of trying to do quality improvement, the campany focuses on trying to get the fine reduced that is charged for a sanction. For the local Clayton community, Centene purchased the land which had a community garden. The garden was removed to put up another building. This building is for Centene University. The CEO commented that members of the community should get out of the way of progress. For employees, Centene does not teat employees fairly or consistently. Those in the inner circle ignore HR policies and give extra vacation time to those who they like. Other employees have their vacation requests ignored and neither approved not denied. Vacation time is accrued at a very slow pace over the year and is then taken away if not used that year. In Missouri, Centene will not pay you for your unused vacation.

Instead they ignore issues until there is a major financial implication or a potentially high profile complaint surfaces. At that moment, they expect front-line members to drop everything, work extended hours and often spend most of their day on phone calls. They will often deflect responsibility to other departments or the front-line members creating an image that their direct reports are not competent. There are also, ""clicks"" in which leaders utilize the talent of only their preferred direct reports and will push them to higher opportunities. They also, utilize the talents of individuals and then pretends as if they did not contribute and then hands that person's efforts to their preferred team member, who was not skilled in the tasks. This is not he-say she-say, this is direct first hand experience.",Centene

If you are looking for a management position and you have a conscience this company is not for you. If you are looking for non management--good luck --have a thick skin. No one will advocate for you even if it is the right thing to do. Benefits are not that great for the money you pay and for a medical insurance company.

62,"""Awful Company To Work For - Stay Away""",1.0,The pros are very few and far between here. The pay was decent providing you could stay at 40 hours (more on that in the Cons section). The cafeteria was great in downtown Clayton and there's a lot of name recognition when you have the company on your resume at least here in St. Louis.,"Yeah, there's lots here. It's a really toxic culture where burnout is very common and most of the time, you are forced to go over 40 hours most weeks which means you are working for free in those cases. Work/Life balance is non-existent here as I saw many people working 50 and even 60 hours a week and at least in our department, it was so hard to get people hired. What I later found out was that HR is very slow posting jobs so departments poach employees from other departments which is unsustainable because eventually some department is going to the the odd one out and will have to post the position. The Clayton office in particular is very stuffy and very conservative in dress (meaning you have to wear a tie). Also politics runs rampant in the Clayton office so if you don't like that, stop applying and look elsewhere. There were a lot of people I met that I wish I didn't meet because all they cared about was looking good and moving up and would use other people to make them look bad so that they could in turn look good. Business is growing really fast here and I would say probably too fast because the systems and other processes as well as workers have not been able to sustainably adapt to the growth. An example of this is the databases. This is the only company where I've been sent in a queue where I've waited over an hour just to run a query. Meanwhile, I'm just waiting and I'm not being a very productive employee since I need that query to finish so that I can do my job. A big let down for me was when I gave my two weeks notice. They did not explain the process at all and because of that, I lost my flexible spending account to where I can't access the money. Also, they do not pay out on vacation upon leaving the company so I lost that too which is not good policy. Every other company I've been at, I at least got some sort of vacation pay. They also never gave me my exit interview or anything so I guess this is where they're going to get my feedback (albeit in public ). As a side note too, they seem to have this bizarre cult like following of the CEO as his picture is on the home page every time you open it up and he's on every single training video where he adds absolutely no value to the video whatsoever. One time they were pressuring employees to vote for him for some kind of executive of the year award. To sum this up, there are just so many cons for me that there is no way I would recommend this company to even my enemies, never mind my friends. I would tell anyone reading this to stay far away from this place.",Centene

Anti-transgender attitude is blatant. Sexual harassment is rampant. It was basically a cult. Everyone is doing drugs, judging or having sex with one another. Worse than a high school. Reminded me of some Jim Jones cult. Abusive is the number one word I would describe this office. I am curious if HQ is aware of the abuse or if they find it funny. Hard telling.

Tricare is different then all other health insurance yet they have completely ignored that fact and run it into the ground. They love to hire people at the very top for Tricare that have ZERO healthcare experience let alone Tricare experience. They love to use outside consultants that have ZERO Tricare and possibly healthcare experience. They have jettisoned countless people that we actually need and replaced them (or not) with cheaper, less experienced and to be frank, not qualified people. I honestly believe this company likes to complicate things rather then simplify in a well planned effort to never have to answer as to why things are done the way are done because everyone is trying to figure out how to fix things that Centene has broken all in the name of some weird attempt at progress. Everything, and I mean everything is wrapped in layer upon layer upon layer which creates constant confusion. The higher you climb the ladder, the more you will see just how inept at running a business this company is. That is a high level view but if you want to know about the little stuff- unless you are in California, your PTO will reset each year, pay not even close to being comparable to other companies, high cost for healthcare, ; dinosaur ideologies like no remote work ability, stringent dress code, and an utter lack of reward for hard work.

Or if you are familiar with the show, Stranger Things, it’s like being trapped in the Upside Down. My coworkers and I would joke that any minute Ashton Kutcher was going to jump out from a corner and tell us that we’ve been punked. It’s, by far, the most dysfunctional and dreadful place I have ever worked. Centene’s biggest issue is management/leadership. Ninety-five percent of management is completely inept. It’s true of the entire company; not just the department I was in. The majority of management is grossly under qualified for their positions, have no management skills, bully their employees, thrive on gossip, and are disrespectful to basically anyone they encounter. I don’t see the cycle of bad management ending anytime soon. Current management does not promote smart, capable people to management positions. Instead, they either hire someone from the outside who has zero experience in the healthcare industry or they promote someone from within who doesn’t qualify, can’t do the job, and/or has been a poor performer. My guess is that they do this because they are either too dumb to know better or they don’t want any competition at the top. Rampant poor management leads to other issues like a toxic culture, low morale, and overall employee dissatisfaction. You are not viewed as a human being once you step foot in the door. You’re expected to work an obscene amount of overtime. Every day is spent putting out fires that are lit by management’s inability to do its job. Also, every person is expected to do the work of 3-4 people. So forget work/life balance. Company policy is no work from home and no remote employees. You’ll see exceptions being made here and there, but don’t expect it if you are a hard worker. The exceptions are usually made for those with poor performance. It made no sense. Oh, and while you are working your life away your manager will likely be shopping online or kicked back with his/her feet up on the desk browsing through social media on their phone. Don’t expect any help from HR. They have no power…or balls. They are there to cover and protect management. Complaints in my dept were repeatedly made to HR and nothing was ever done. They just talk in circles like they are doing something, but they aren’t. Every year they send out an employee satisfaction survey, and every year they act like the results came back just fine and refuse to take action on anything. I questioned a VP in my dept about HR's lack of action on the survey results. He literally told me the company, as a whole, has no plans to do anything about it. As long as the company is climbing the Fortune 500 list they don’t care about anything else. You may see articles in the news about how much Centene is growing and all the new jobs they are hiring for. Don’t let them fool you. Sure, it’s growing (for the moment) but the current workforce is flying out the doors as quickly as it can. It does not take long for a new employee to figure out there is something seriously wrong with that place. Most of their hiring is just to refill positions that left. Security there is over-the-top. Cameras and security guards are everywhere. You have to swipe your badge so many places just to get in and out. I had to swipe my badge 9 times just to get to my desk every morning. Sure, you do feel safe that nothing too crazy will happen there, but I would still feel safe with much less security. You feel like you are in a police state. Some individual guards were very nice but, like the rest of the management, the management in security are bullies. I know several coworkers who got a 3-4 page scathing email from security just for parking in the wrong spot! It’s insane. I could go on and on, but I think you get the picture. You have been warned. It's worth being unemployed a little longer to find a company that is not ran by ignorant lunatics.",Centene

Management needs major improvements they need to get rid of all the managers that currently run the show and put on people that actually cares about the companies needs. The training is too short they need to extend the training from 4 weeks to 12 like most insurance companies do there is too much valuable information that is not being shared with the employees because training is too short.

During reorganization Michael Niedorf stated that he valued the employees that he had, and wanted to find other areas for them to work. He must not know that the senior leadership laid them off in favor of outsourcing work for a system (Pega) that is a poor solution to the efficiency of an in house built system. the managers have no care to the employees or contractors and bringing this up to directors falls on deaf ears. If you want to just collect a paycheck and not do a job that you love, then this is the place for you. If you want pay and job satisfaction, look elsewhere.

253,"""A Wonderful Company - A Not So Great Department""",4.0,"There are so many reasons why I love working for Centene! To start, the benefits are second to none. The Health Insurance plans are great, and the PTO is very generous. I love what Centene does as a company, and it's very rewarding to know we work for a company that is helping others. The other thing I love about Centene is there are so many advancement opportunities. There is definitely a career path for everyone at Centene whether that is in the many corporate offices in the St. Louis area, transferring to another US office, or moving under one of Centene's affiliate companies or partners. I know I will be able to grow my career and stay here for as long as they will keep me! Many of the employees at Centene have been here for 10 or more years which really says something about a company. Centene is also growing at a rapid rate! They are a leader in the Healthcare industry, and it doesn't look like they will be stopping anytime soon. From what I've seen, the CEO really tries to involve himself with the employees at Centene. He cares about the company a lot while also being caring toward the employees. Compensation and pay is really good for industry standards! I feel I am paid fairly for my experience and expertise given the role I am currently in.","The only true con I have for the company is the inability to work from home. I know the CEO doesn't really believe in working from home, and I understand his reasons, however, even giving employees the ability to work from home in case of an emergency or even the option just for morale would really be helpful for stress and cost savings! The majority of the cons I have are for my department, Provider Data Management. My current department is known as ""the joke"" in the company. Not kidding. Many people who have worked at Centene in multiple departments state that the PDM department is not a representation of the entire company. The department is a revolving door. They are always hiring more people, and while Centene does not have a problem with nepotism, the PDM department does. Many of the employees hired in the department are all from the same company, which the current employees know the reason for this. Special treatment is given to these new employees, and it is very noticeable to all of the other employees. The PDM department has not been able to keep a Manager very long, which is another revolving door position. No one within Centene wants to apply for the position given PDM's reputation, so all managers normally are external candidates. No recognition is given within the department for those that do work hard and have been with the department for a while. People who want to see the department succeed have tried applying for supervisory role positions only to be told by upper management they are not qualified and then they hire a person from outside the department with no PDM experience whatsoever. Overtime is constantly offered in the PDM department, but some employees are able to get away with abusing it. These employees will work 15+ hour days and not be hitting production numbers, but Management turns the other way and won't acknowledge it. I'm honestly surprised HR hasn't gotten involved at this point. Many people within the department have gone to HR several times with complaints about management, treatment, and to let them know what's really going on, but nothing has been done, and it continues to be known as the worst department in the company. All of the hard workers in the department eventually leave to other departments due to the corruptness that is within PDM.",Centene

I really appreciated the cafeteria, because they had a wide range of options. The workers were always nice and did a great job or washing my car and shampooing my seats. The other plus was the covered and free parking. Besides those few things, Centene is terrible.","Working at Centene is like being in an abusive relationship. I’ve never been in one but I would think it would be pretty close to working at this place. Centene is filled with bullies and unreal expectations and if you aren’t strong enough to interact with them you’ll fail. The management is awful. I can count on one hand the managers that are actually making a decision for the best interest of the members and can actually manage people and departments. Everyone else is trash. They are all condescending and nutty. None of them have any sense. It’s like working for toddlers. Centene is a prison. From the moment you set foot on Centene’s location, you have to have your ID or you will not be able to do basic things like get through main doors and use the elevators. Every door that you go through, minus the main front entrance, you have to swipe in. It’s like Fort Knox. If you forget your ID, you are treated like a child to get a replacement ID for the day. There isn’t any privacy. The cubes have glass around them so your department and neighbors can see every single thing that you are doing and hear every single conversation that you are having. In order to take or make a personal call, you need to leave your desk. There are so many people take personal calls in the kitchenette areas, stairwells, and cafeteria. The WFH policy doesn’t exist. You may get away with it for extreme emergencies, but it’s very much so looked down upon. Centene is not flexible with hours, they are a hard 8-5 type of company. If you want flexibility, you have to take it upon yourself to do so until someone says anything. The stress level at Centene has caused issues within peoples family because they either never get a break (always on call) or it causes issues with your health. So many people within my department have had health issues because of the stress from Centene (myself included). I knew within the first two months of working there that Centene was not the place for normal people. Everyone that I met at the beginning of working at Centene (2 years ago) have left. I know very few people that have stayed at Centene past 2-3 years. I know a few people that have taken a leave of absence so that they can find a new job, because it was too stressful. I have never felt so dumb at any place I’ve ever worked. Centene spends a lot of money to outsource everything. Our department was never able to use our brains there. Everyone in my department was treated as an admin. Not that there is anything wrong with an admin, but when you are hired to do something else besides what you were told your job duties were. Your morale shifts and you start to wonder why are you even there. I’ve missed out on 2 years of career development. Centene has held me back on advancing my career and I couldn’t get it fast enough. Thankfully, I am no longer at the hell hole. Within the last two months, 4 people have left my department. The rest of the department is looking. I made sure to tear that place into pieces within my exit survey and interview. My department had terrible engagement scores and nothing was ever done about it even HR got involved. Centene does not care about their employees well-being. They only want to continue being in the spotlight and making more people at the top more money. So they will continue to hire and not have processed in order, and they will eventually crumble. The turnover is too high. I surely hope I’m around when they do crumble. I have NEVER in my life worked in a place so toxic and unethical in all of my life. So if you don’t care about your health, love being overworked, enjoy being bullied, like being watched and treated like a child, (if you have a family) enjoys missing time with your family....then this place is for YOU. If you have morals and other options...RUN...RUN VERY FAST. NEVER EVER LOOK BACK!! I promise you. I wish someone would have told me all of this. Save yourself the trouble.",Centene

They make sure that you never get enough time to build rapport with your boss or have enough time under one person so that they can accurately report your growth as an employee. Great way to minimize your yearly merit increase. • A change in your daily duties/ responsibilities – They loooove to call refer to these job description changes as “new challenges” and “a way to express your creativity” and of course when all else fails…. the truth is spilt “these changes reflect the new needs of the company so these needs will be met (with or without you). I was hired as an outbound Customer Care Representative. Within my first 18 months I became an inbound/outbound Customer Care Representative who performed Lead duties such as adding members to the system and tracking referrals. Little by little they add/ change what you were hired to do – I ended up being on a special project (that the company could only keep up for two operational years) being more of a case manager than anything else. Merit increase… 3%. • To see a certain type rise to the top, while you do their work and get no credit – This company likes to promote from within…. but you will soon realize that there is a distinct “type” that is allowed to do so. They pride themselves on diversity, and it can be seen in a way: Blacks and Browns in “menial” positions (customer service, some health coaching positions, caseworkers), Blacks and Whites in lower management (mind you MOST of these people do not have prior managerial training nor do they get adequate training before they are given their own team), these they shuffle around like a pack of playing cards, and then there is a large middle management team that surprisingly does not reflect the “diversity” that is seen in the call centers.

If you get up to go to the bathroom, you will more than likely return to find a pop up message from someone saying ""you've been inactive for more than two minutes, is there something we can help you with?"" Yes, I'm being serious. Getting a passing score on audits is almost impossible. When you need to follow up with a member, you're supposed to do it between calls. Yes- between calls. There is no reason for the call center to be open until 8pm. People have families and working until 8pm makes it hard to have any quality time with loved ones. Trying to field billing calls is absolutely ridiculous. Member's invoices are never in line with what they actually owe, which is upsetting for members when they call to make a payment. Many reps just transfer members off to another number or say anything to get off the phone with them rather than taking the time and trying to help them, which doubles the work because those members call back, angry, and someone else has to deal with them. Having to have about thirty different programs, websites, job aides, and vendor sites up on your monitor and then being expected to have no ""dead air"" when you take a call and you're trying to utilize those resources to help a member is not logical. And forget about using the ""Escalation lines""- those people will do absolutely anything to NOT take the call, including talking to you like you're stupid and treating you like YOU should have done more to appease the member because they don't want to deal with the call and/or don't know how. There is not enough time alotted for entering notes when taking member calls. If you try to enter notes while on the phone, how are you supposed to be listening to the member and talking to them? But if you wait until after the call and try to enter notes that make sense and sound intelligent, you'll get pop-ups from those same pests that message you when you go to the bathroom, letting you know that you're taking too long doing something other than what they want you to be doing. Just as a general rule of thumb, the employees there never looked happy. Probably because they weren't. I know I wasn't.

Everyone I know there is looking for a new job and fighting to get themselves on a list for a severance package in one of its layoff rounds. There is so much back-biting, vicious, and unprofessional behavior, especially at the VP and SVP level. No one is proud to work there and it's nothing more than a paycheck until people find something better at another company. All of this is compounded by the fact that health insurance is falling apart as an industry while the executive team makes millions of dollars in their paychecks on the backs of people who are on Medicaid and Medicare. It's just sick. ""Innovation"" there means developing products and services that allow the company to layoff more people and save more money so the executives can further pad their paychecks. And the worst part is that the leadership is actually proud of their motives and brags about them. I know people who have left this company because they developed severe anxiety thanks to bullying by their leaders. It's a hostile place.

We were forced to make staff work 80 hours a week, nights, weekends...whatever it took. Everyday I came into a dozen new problems that cropped up overnight. Centene is NOT the place to work if you have a family and want to keep it. In addition, the stress of the environment literally made me physically sick. I ended up in the doctors office for high stress and exhaustion. It took me months to get back to normal after leaving Centene.

POOR management and direction from the CEO down. They call themselves and IT company that does medical insurance. What does that even mean? Well, I can tell you it's only a ploy to increase stock value to shareholders. They do not develop or produce any software or hardware or provide professional services for resale. It would be similar to Chase Bank saying they're an IT company that does banking. They truly only care about compliance and not security which means they have a completely fractured security environment with various tools that do not receive proper care and feeding. This also means fractured security teams with defined roles being extremely vague... They also do not care much or at all to train their staff on the currently used security stack/tools. In other words, if you're an analyst, engineer or architect and are given a tool and need to be the SME DO NOT expect training. To be fair, maybe this is all because they've grown incredibly fast. As to benefits it's nothing to droll over. I've had cheaper and better coverage at other companies. This I find strange as this is a HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY! Their 401k is vested after 4 years and is matched to 3%. Not much to be desired honestly. They offer a 5% discount on purchasing stock... This is incredibly lame as most companies I'm familiar with is at least 15%. They do offer bonuses which seem decent, usually 6%. That said, if you are part of the company they acquire DO NOT expect a bonus when you get rolled into their HR fully. The list can honestly go on and on IMO. Management infighting. A ""do as I say"" not ""do as I do"" type of management environment... Very condescending management across departments.

Writing employees up for returning one minute late from break is a waste of everyone's time!! Nepotism is RAMPANT and the more incompetent a manager the higher they are promoted to get them away from people! If you're in the inner circle you can do no wrong!!! Unethical behavior including federal violations among management all the way to the top is commonplace and when it's reported the whistleblower WILL be shown the door!!!! Integrity is PREACHED but again NEVER ENFORCED!!!! There are NO promotional opportunities for most departments and while life balance is preached it is never practiced. It's so sad that a group of very talented employees is treated so unprofessionally. Turnover in my subsidiary was 71% two years ago. Magically those numbers were ""massaged"" to 22%. The employees I worked with were AWESOME and TRULY talented professionals. It's beyond pathetic they're leaving in droves! I left after 10 years.

510,"""Growing faster than the company can handle""",2.0,"Company has positioned itself to grow very very rapidly by taking over other networks. There is a constant need for more ways to handle the information they get and to get a better idea of what's going on in the data. This was shown to me in the interview by the managers describing how they had risen quickly in the past two or four years. Company pays relatively well. Benefits included secured parking, on-site services like dry cleaning and oil changes, a health clinic, and a pretty good cafeteria. Company is probably the fastest-growing in the St. Louis area and if you want a Fortune 500 culture, it is definitely real there!","My advice to job seekers: first, make sure your job description is not just generic but is your actual job description. Two weeks in I realized that I wasn't doing what I had been told in the interview. When I complained, I was told we needed 6 months to a year to get there and it was good for me to learn the company's processes. Fine, but I wouldn't have left my old company if that had been the case. Second, make sure you meet your manager. I did and I liked my manager well enough, but many of my coworkers didn't. They were told they'd be hired into one group and then that would change. I understand things do change and companies re-org (my department had more than one in my brief time there) but it's a sign that the company is still adapting, painfully, to change. The single biggest problem I have with the company is its character. It is a Fortune 500 company that pays lip service to caring about its employees, yet everywhere I look I see people incredibly stressed-out and afraid. I've heard people say ""Oh, morale isn't low, we're just all focused."" I'd go to birthday celebrations and people would be so quiet, barely talking, just huddled in their little groups. People were AFRAID. There was definitely fear running through that company. The only ones who were happy there had either never worked anywhere else, or had worked at places with worse reputations like ExpressScripts. Working at Centene's HQ feels like being in a police state. Security makes a point that employees are the biggest security risk, and you are treated as such. People are visibly uncomfortable when security gets on the elevator with them - it's like being followed by a squad car for more than half a mile on the highway. Parking is secured, building is secured, floors are secured and elevator access is secured. Everything you do is tracked. If you access the wrong website (say you pull up a page with ""SQL Injection"") you'll get a phone call. If you miss a question on the ethics test you may get an email from HR. Every day I spent there felt suffocating. There is a huge separation between the VPs and senior management, and everyone else. Abuse of power, and of employees, is frequent. I've seen analysts come out of meetings with senior management in tears over missed deadlines. I thought we were past this, people, and it is ridiculous to see bullying tolerated. When I complained (and I complained often) I was told ""oh, we're watching it, just keep focused on your work."" Technology is surprisingly poor and the infrastructure controls make it difficult to get anything. When I signed on it took two weeks and no fewer than 20 distinct service requests to get all my applications and access points set up. There is minimal work-life balance. When you start you don't get paid time off for 90 days. If you need to take off because you're sick, you're told just to come in. People would come in with bronchitis and walking pneumonia because they had run out of sick days. Terrible. If you miss hours one day you come in on the weekend to make them up. If you work extra one day, maybe you get to leave a little early the next but don't tell anyone. And there's absolutely no remote work - you'll get flagged if you try to do anything other than check email from home.",Centene

Yes, they said that is why we are hiring only talented knowledgeable nurses. It saddens me to say that was all a lie. This is corporate america they have no idea what actually caring for people means, nor do they care. The managers are appalled by questions because they have no clue what the answers are. They spend most days behind doors in meetings and if you have a question DO NOT ASK..... The training is unorganized and done as quickly as possible. If you do ask a question management will swear they have already given you all you need to be successful. This is a call center. The goal is to contact as many people as you can, engage them in case management, and then call to say hello once every 1-3 weeks. Nothing more nothing less. Just meet state requirements. I was excited about the changes the Health Care Reform was designed to bring, but nothing has changed. The Medicaid/Medicare dollars under served, privileged, and the elderly Americans need, still continues to line the pockets of others. I am true nurse at heart. I armed myself with knowledge and resources , so I could share it with my members/patients in hopes of educating them on how to achieve a better quality of life . I hope by sharing my knowledge, care, and compassion to others,if only small or one person at a time, I can make a difference in someone's live.

There were many times where individuals just work the overtime without being asked and managers probably didn't even know about it. -- The reason that this happens is because upper level managers over promise without consulting the engineers/employees or their managers doing the work. -- Centene is not a company that does not has either a flexible work schedule or a working from home policies and there is very little sign of such policy being approved since the CEO discourages it. -- Despite what you might think, there is extremely high turnover rate of IT staff at Centene, which is a big concern as the company continues to grow and become dependent on new technology. To some people, Centene can sometimes be a ""brutal"" place to work. To give an insight into the culture, just read a quote from the Chief Information Security Officer in the St. Louis Business Journal.

You have to accomplish something in every hour or you will fall behind the schedule. No padding time scheduled for any unexpected events however they always happen. So every day, you feel like you are fighting a fire after another fire and there is no time for you to catch your breath. 2. ""Meet at work and work at home"": The teams are moving so fast and lots of meetings are scheduled to keep everyone on the same page. you spend 4 hours in meetings and your manager expect you to do 8 hours of work.
