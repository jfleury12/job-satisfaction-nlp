The company has ok pay and benefits but that’s really about it. You’re just a number. The training seems proficient until you’re out on your own. They tell you to ask questions but some of the trainers and liaisons will treat you like a nuisance. Everyone learns differently but this type of work isn’t for everybody and that’s ok. However, no matter what they’re going to make you feel like an idiot. The systems malfunction every other day but by some miracle you’re expected to meet and even exceed quota everyday with no errors (impossible). They require too many steps in order to do one simple task. If you make any errors there is no proper feedback provided, you’ll just hear criticisms about yourself among the managers, liaisons and even other benefit reps. Free soda everyday and a free lunch incentive once in a while is not nearly enough to stay in a place that is basically the definition of toxic. Management is incredibly rude and messy. Rumors about employees’ personal lives get spread around, meanwhile there is no confirmation about anything. Regardless they should stop being in people’s business so much, but I guess you can’t help yourself when you’re miserable. One of main liaisons there who deep down believes she’s a manager but it’s laughable because despite the extensive knowledge she has the lack of professionalism and people skills is unfathomable.",AmerisourceBergen

As other reviewers of the IntrinsiQ branch of Amerisource have noted, the ""Frisco"" culture is an issue that needs to be addressed. During the recent ""Transformation"" of Amerisource , many of us thought that the Texas office would see massive layoffs of middle management / executives, but that did not occur. Our branch of Amerisource was losing money and the leadership appeared to have no plan in place to generate new products and new revenue. Instead, an ongoing downsize was taking place.

They claimed they cared about our customers and their patients, however they would penalize you for actually taking the time to solve customer issues. There are reps there who only take inbound calls but do nothing the customer asked- probably because they're fearful it will impact their average handle time (AHT). Yet curiously we didn't even have metrics when I left, apart from QA. So how can someone be held to a standard like AHT when there is NO standard?

Why would a company invest all the time and effort for on-boarding a new employee, do the training, pay them benefits, give them a laptop, desk, etc and then only give 90 days - this is just bad business all around and fosters bad morale. It takes a little more time than that to get used to a job and develop and nurture relationships with clients. Stop hiring so many people if you know the majority of them will not last. Change the metrics so they can support stability in the sales dept. Supervisors are frequently hostile and behave in inappropriate ways such as discussing reps being fired with staff before that rep is even aware, discussing their metrics with ""favorites"" and just out right gossiping. Very similar to middle school. After reading other reviews (Bellco Generics) it's amazing how this company is still getting away with these unethical tactics . Where is HR in all this mess?

Middle management is too thick. There are as many workers as there are managers except managers don't do any of the true work; they just tell the employees to do the work that they already know to be doing. Fat middle management segments create roles where no roles need to be, redundant roles, meanwhile not enough workers to actually do the work. If you don't drink the corporate kool-aid then you will be reprimanded for not caring enough about other departments of the company, even if they don't pertain to your department. Management will not give warnings. I have been a faithful employee and slipped up once. And for the next two weeks I had evidence trumped up against me that was fabricated, and had my job threatened daily. They will threaten your job out of the blue as a motivational technique. Work environment created by management is unhealthy and hostile. Conflicting priorities given by the tens of thousands of different ""bosses"" that you have will inevitably cause you to forsake one priority for another, and then you will be yelled at by the managers who's requests you put on hold for the other manager. Complaining culture from tenured employees fosters in this pseudo-busyness whereby employees can fake being busy and shirk their workload onto new employees.

Many have not managed others before and it shows. Yearly reviews aren't constructive nor or are they timely. Our 2017 performance goals that started on October 1st 2016 (beginning of fiscal year) have not been delivered by our management team as today's date. That equates to 7 months 24 days without performance goals. No indication on when they will be delivered. No accountability held again against management for this issue.

Local management suffers serious ""Big Fish - Little Pond"" syndrome and treat the employees who are actually cognizant of the customer base like outcasts. Large projects that drastically affect the client base in a negative manner are put in place without engaging the employees who actually know how and even if the project would be feasible to begin with. Then, said employees are blamed for the massive failure while the management team who initiated it with no input from the employees are rewarded for trying.

Supervisors are constantly bad mouthing their employees and the woman in charge has no clue what she is doing. Trying to explain something to her is like talking to a brick wall, she has no knowledge of the job and attempts to micromanage EVERYTHING. The management does not care about their employees whatsoever, they only care about not being sued. If an employee calls HR on them, they ban together to ""have each other's back"" and sit in their office with the HR rep and try to guess what employee called. The sexual harassment in the building is off the charts, and the disrespect is unbelievable. Everyone in the building is too afraid to step up and attempt to make a change because everyone who has before them has either been fired or will remain in their same position until they're fired or quit.

It is also a necessity that technician’s matchup their pay stubs to their timecards. Management consistently performs overrides to remove overtime from timecards, without any legitimate explanation of why. When confronted supervisors blame the technicians for not clocking out when that same supervisor was the one that forced the technician to work the overtime, to begin with. Many of the company events such as holiday parties, technicians are strictly told not to attend and that they are for the rest of the company and not for them. Throughout the year technicians are told by User Services management not to engage in conversation with individuals in other departments because those individuals are much too important and too busy to be bothered. Technicians also do not enjoy many of the company-wide perks such as being off on certain non-federal holidays, or half-day Fridays in the summer, that other departments receive. Being a call center environment this is understandable, but you would think management would provide some other alternative like a time and a half pay rate or floating days off. Management does not care about the concerns of employees. Representatives are constantly told to their face that they are expendable. HR has to be aware of the high turnover rate within the department (literally all through quitting), yet nothing is done about management.",AmerisourceBergen

Weekends are always off which is a great bonus for a lot of us. Only when system issues arise does the call volume shoot up. More often than not it's an average of 2-3 minutes per call. The main thing we are responsible for is checking stock on available items and reaching to confirm availability.Sometimes depending on the time of your shift, you may not get a call for a good 10 minutes. This allows a lot of downtime to work on other tasks or even browse the web. (within reason). They do believe in their employees and offer great incentives like awards for providing excellent service and going above and beyond. Also, the equipment is decent (at times slow) but more so it's nice and the workspace is nice, clean and efficient. Large food area and majority of the time there is a food truck out on the lot to eat from. They now offer hour lunches (adds 30 minutes to either the beginning or end of your set schedule) Workforce Management chooses this, unfortunately you cannot however it's way better and offers more flexibility throughout the day. Also most of the supervisors are down to earth and friendly. Senior management on sight has gotten the hint to be more receptive and offer more flexibility to the agents. This is huge compared to how it was when I first started over a year ago.","I find the most difficult things to deal with are at times are dealing with situations where there was a lack of follow-through by the previous agent who may have assisted a customer. At times this can get stressful because a representative didn't leave clear notes or sometimes management may not have caught a process issue. This career doesn't play around with tardies. 1 minute late, is considered a tardy so timeliness is key for your success at AmerisourceBergen. Management (including call center supervisors) are held to a different standard compared to the call center CARE representatives. (This is apparent when it comes to how AmerisourceBergen disciplines it's associates compared to how they ""manage"" their supervisors. Across the organization there's been what they've been calling it as ""restructuring"" which to them is better term that they use instead of just saying layoffs. Fortunately the CARE team isn't affected however it does change the level of security for advancements within this facility. I don't see where I could truly grow in this environment which is why I'm looking for better opportunity. If they offered it I'd probably be more inclined to stay.",AmerisourceBergen

We have a few associates that think it's their place to stir up drama, lie, make up stories about things they don't know, assume and when a process is put in place for the company to move in a better direction the same employees makes it impossible for others to see the new leaf. You are hired to do a job, if you don't like the job then quit it.

Learn that it isn't a personal attack; only improvisation so employees that are driven to be the best they can be, which only promotes growth for the company. You will learn a great deal as to how to cover yourself, if you don't already know. The managers claim to have meetings with other teams regarding process changes and business acquisitions; however, pertinent information that will make the coordinators job easier and more efficient, is not relayed to the coordinator. It's more of who's at whom's desk, which in turn, does nothing. Morale would be better if we ran more like a well oiled machine, not the Titanic, after it hits the iceburg. There is always a knee jerk reaction when managers who have not done what needs to be done and the problem is out of control, which again, make the coordinators suffer. Also, you have intelligent coordinators; listen to their ideas and implement them. Most of the supervisors are on the defense, because they are not doing their job well and their coordinators go to them with their concerns or questions. US Bioservices is run more as a ""mom and pop"" shop pharmacy and that simply does not fly. At times, it seems as though supervisors and/or managers are intimidated by coordinators who happen to be very intelligent and they know it, but don't want their positions put into jeopardy.

The company has no respect for your life, I know of employees who worked a 17 hour day during the week of Christmas.

You are never left alone - a mentor, a boss, a buddy is always there to help you get what you need to succeed. The only way to fail is to literally not try at all! Compensation is market level, the 401k is good, and the benefits package is great. Any doctor or dentist will tell you that your plan is excellent! Work-life balance is a high-priority, but there are times you must grind out the 50/60/70 hour week. This is very team-dependent, but for every long and hard week there is the occasional long team lunch, early Friday, and and standard 40 hours. Senior management varies depending on person and department, but most people are very passionate about both ABC and developing their teams. There is a common saying that ""harsh bosses do not last long at ABC"" because of the culture of respect. You will be hard pressed to find better culture and values at any company. Respect and fairness is found at all levels. Truly, we do shape healthcare for our customers, and help get patients the medication they need at a price they can afford. In short - WORK HERE. ABC is an excellent company.","Compensation could always be a bit higher, 401k matching could be a little higher. There is no real cafeteria, but instead there are vendors that bring food... While most people love the Chikafila vendor, it would be nice to have a real cafeteria with some hot foods available for breakfast and lunch. Not every team has a great work-life balance, especially short-staffed IT teams. It would not hurt to identify overworked teams and hire another employee to share the load. In short - our problems are minor, and will likely be addressed due to very receptive management... again, WORK HERE.",AmerisourceBergen

Our compensation packages are market bottom; bottom of the barrel scraping poor. We cannot recruit any real talent with these salaries so we end up hiring the worst of the worst. We end up with new hires that have absolutely zero leadership skills, no chance of ever becoming leaders, yet think that the adolescent attitude that got them through high school will prevail in the corporate world. In 4 years, I have lost all of my top performers. You should see what I am left with and what I can afford to hire! Make no mistake, the company is making money. But it is being bled dry by senior leadership. We all see the articles in the news where $2.4 billion went to buy back company shares and the next day our CEO sold over 20,000 of his company granted stock options. That's were the money is going. It is certainly not going into my business unit's budget! Simultaneously, our bonus goals are close to impossible to achieve. Good luck reaching your 40% bonus goal under these conditions! We can't motivate or engage a single associate when the company is making billions yet is being run down into a flea market type of environment. If you have any hopes of career advancement, keep on dreaming. The only way to advance within the current state of organizational dysfunction, is to be friends with someone who can promote you or to be part of the in crowd. You will not be promoted on experience, merit, education, or hard work. None of that matters when we are all insulating ourselves with our friends to ensure that we will never be threatened by someone more competent or knowledgeable. You will only reach the point that we allow you to reach. Yes, I am guilty of that practice. But in this internal environment, that is the reality and the practice. Not convinced yet? Then some much needed perspective follows. Look at our top competitor's website; also, look at their GlassDoor site. Notice how they are an employee centered company? Notice how they portray themselves in the corporate world completely different than AmerisourceBergen? Read their GlassDoor reviews. The differences should tell you a lot. If you are internal to the organization, take a look at our Vision, Mission, and Values. There's nothing in there about you, about providing you with a world class working environment.
