298,"""No Work Life Balance""",1.0,"Meeting People; other than that, few pros","No work life balance – Upper management stressed the importance of work life balance, yet they heaped project upon project with unrealistic, short deadlines. Before you could even move forward on any work, you would be pulled away to address some new unrelated emergency. Then you would often be required to drop everything to attend meeting upon meeting, and conference calls (including calls to discuss the topic for the next meeting). Before a project could be fully completed, management would roll out another project with another unrealistic deadline resulting in unfinished work. To add insult to injury, any manager with a CDL was needed to cover deliveries due to the high driver turnover rate and frequent callouts. When you would return from covering a route, your whole day of incomplete work was there waiting for you. Then, when you thought you might catch up, they would do a re-organization. If you didn’t work 70+ hours a week, you would quickly fall behind and if you even considered reducing the week to 40 or 45 hours to spend time with your family, there were guaranteed consequences. The same upper management that preached about work life balance would demand to know why tasks weren’t completed. Stress – The phone rang day and night with employees calling out sick at 2 AM and employees calling to complain about their route at 7 PM knowing you were awake since 2 AM that day. Managers would call day and night to complain that a merchandiser or driver didn’t fill something properly or didn’t remove out of date products. On 3 or 4 occasions, I received work related phone calls / text messages from over-zealous managers when they knew I was on vacation! Vacations were like a punishment because you would come back to hundreds of emails, voice mails and piles of unfinished and new work. I have more gray hair and the stress probably took years off of my life. Failure to acknowledge talent – Many of the most dedicated people in lower management, those who achieve results through hard work and long hours, are not recognized or well compensated. Supervisors are salaried and, whether they work 40 or 70+ hours, they only get paid for 40. The salaries are low compared to other industries and increases are well below the rate of inflation. The only way to see more than 2% or 3% is to get promoted and that usually only happens when you are in tight with the right people, or the owners. I worked many hours away from my family (lost of time and experiences that I’ll never, ever get back) trying to make an impression on upper management, then only to be passed over on several occasions by candidates with less experience or qualifications. Companies like this often lose their best talent and are perpetually trying to run a business with inexperience and endless trainees. CDL Driver turnover – It is no mystery there is frequent driver turnover in this business. New drivers start out without comprehending the long and labor-intensive type of work expected of them. The typical day for a driver starts very early and begins with stress as they learn they have 20+ stops, many with time window restrictions. There are delays and, in order to avoid refusals, other stops need to be moved out of the way and completed out of order. The driver must put the product on the shelves at many stops and work at a fast, steady pace for up to 14 hours. With callouts and turnover, drivers often work 60 hours per week and on weekends. At this pace, accidents happen, and drivers are held accountable. They do not earn as much as other drivers in other industries and, as a result, their attendance suffers, and they quit only after a few months. This puts additional strain on their peers and managers alike. Although many of this reflects on experiences at TCCC and its subsidiary companies, it also reveals wholistic facts about employment in the food and beverage business. I’m posting this to inform anyone who might consider employment in this industry so they can avoid the same mistakes I made. Plan on not seeing much of your family, plan on being stressed out, plan on never completing home projects, and plan on being a lot less happy and less healthy. You will be held accountable for things out of your control and you will be a miserable, mean-spirited person. Oh, and to add to your stress, you will also barely earn enough to make ends meet and will likely fall into some form of financial debt. Otherwise, if you like what you see above, then this is the right employment choice for you.",Coca Cola

So much talent has been dismissed over a phony assessment process. March 15th is our last day. Really, what they did was retain lower skilled workers and got rid of the hard-working ones who put VEB on the map with their tenacity and knowledge of the bottler system. The senior leadership team is a complete fraud and was not at all transparent about the process in which dozens of people would lose their jobs. The company did these bogus assessments where your manager, their manager and then their manager supposedly assessed your skills and talents. The only problem is, they weighted the four categories so your past performance was only like a 10% factor. Past performance was the only category that isn't subjective. You either hit your plan or you didn't. So, if you hit your plan every year consistently but they want to get rid of you for cheaper talent, they can score you lower on the other portions because those are subjective and also carry more weight.

It's really a marketing/advertising company. Thus the financial investment in updating the public areas of HQ (most of the employee office space is outdated). The bottlers (of which KO has jerked around for YEARS - google the lawsuit) get all of the capital intensive labor and assets associated with bottling and distribution. KO basically sells the concentrate to the bottlers and gets to maximize profit by re-franchising. That was the model before CCE was spun off in the late 80s, and that's what the company has returned to in an effort to return to profitability. The company's cash flow is in serious peril, so the re-franchising and annual layoffs are the company's way of cost-cutting to improved cash flow. And recently, the company changed its comp structure so that most employees will not receive annual merit raises (regardless of performance). KO has coasted on its brand recognition for years, along with Warren Buffett's endorsement (curiously, his son, Howard Buffett, retired from the BOD last year). The stock price is way overvalued, and new CEO Quincey has the arduous task of feigning a company turnaround after Muhtar Kent's poor leadership. KO waited too long to invest and market more of its other brands that would be pleasing to the health-obsessed consumer, and ill-advisedly doubled down on soda, particularly Coke. Quincey is trying to change that, but is probably about 10 years too late. The iceberg beneath the surface has done its damage. Even if it the ship can remain above water, KO can only coast for so long. Godspeed to anyone who doesn't work in sales/marketing or product development - every other department is and will continue to be chess pieces in the on-going saga to keep the company solvent.",Coca Cola

This model has served Coca-Cola well for decades but the world has wised up on how unhealthy their beverages are. The business continues to struggle, and rightfully so. Mind you, they diversified but have failed to make a sizable dent in other beverages categories, nearly all of which are unprofitable and of poor quality vs. competition. You see, Coca-Cola isn’t good at making quality products, they’re really good at marketing poor ones and best when they’re loaded with calories. Their only success has been a couple acquisitions that they didn’t destroy inside a couple years and raising their product’s price. Their latest strategy is to sell smaller sizes for more money. For any business, it’s never a healthy indicator to have consumers desire less of your product. Such a strategy will catch up soon and the ship will list drastically and turn downward. Work life is good with a nice HQ and good benefits; it’s one of the few companies that still offers a pension. You’ll like it if you can get over the destructive societal impacts you would be complicit to such as direct contributing to the annual deaths of thousands from diabetes, heart disease, and other obesity related illnesses. Couple that with hundreds of millions of bottles and cans in landfills, incredible & unchecked carbon emissions from freight, working here really requires a dismissive quality to your impact on the world. Now, they’ll try to convince you everything is ok by brainwashing you through “Ambassador” training. There you’ll learn all of the “alternative facts” that they have funded through for-profit scientists and physicians willing to forego their integrity for dollars. Then when local governments wise up and look to legislate taxes to assuage consumers to healthier alternatives they pour tons of marketing dollars with their ‘alternative facts” to defeat it at the ballot. Then they’ll talk about all the good they do in the community from employing thousands, to assisting in disaster relief. Admirable, yes, but that’s also from the playbook of every drug cartel since Pablo Escobar. Philanthropy despite how beneficial, should not excuse one's ongoing sins. This is especially true given how sizable their debt is to society. Given all of that, the best people of Coca-Cola have left or are planning to leave. What’s left is a completely inept management team that has no idea what to do but to fund more marketing spend. This phenomenon has led to the departure of what I consider some of the greatest minds to ever grace North Avenue. This includes our best senior executives to the most promising millennials who all fought to make the right changes but couldn’t overcome a bloated organization’s dithering. That said, if you don’t want to accomplish anything and can endure the awful leadership and HR uselessness this is the place for you. You’ll accomplish little besides powerpoint or an internal presentation as the bureaucratic layers of the system and ‘who owns what conflict’ will destroy anything promising through risk averse debate. I’m planning on leaving early next year to collect my bonus and move on to another company that I’ve already laid the groundwork for. I’ve worked terribly hard this year but thinking back I don’t think I accomplished anything. Just lots of powerpoint and presenting… sigh.",Coca Cola

Your opinion about working here might be drastically different based on the position you have. However, I would avoid taking the order builder position. I was excited about taking this position because the pay was good, especially for warehouse work at nearly $18 an hour and I was a top performer at my position. I knew coming in that the job would be very physical but i knew i could do a good job and get promoted based on performance and my education. As a new order builder you'll most likely start on night shift and you will almost always work 12-14 hours and frequently work 16 hour shifts. Your managers will treat you like your lazy, despite how hard you work, because the people who get tired of how bad they are treated start not trying and they outnumber the people that do try, so managers are put in a tough position and most resort to pushing people to hard. It was common to see managers arguing with warehouse workers. Shift managers are not forced to be on overtime so it wasn't uncommon for me to see the manager for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd shift because they kept us there so long. My breaking point was just how you were treated as an order builder, and I didn't want to be a shift manager trying to deal with the culture of that place. It legitimly seemed like it was border line illegal how long you were required to be there at times. To top things off when I was there, there were frequent problems with pay roll being accurate (the HR team is a type of hotline thing that this coca cola warehouse hires that i believe is located in Florida, but there isn't like an actual HR person you can talk to) and when you voiced your concerns about not being paid right it wasn't common for you managers to try to convince you that you were wrong or try to not pay you on a technicality, for example if you worked friday night into saturday they might tell you, you didn't qualify for over time pay, that is one example I knew of when i was there.",Coca Cola

Now they have to use a personal vhehicle and it needs to be compliant with their standards to give the employees an auto allowance on their paychecks. This means that they basically have to buy a new car every 5 years, and it can't be more than 5 years old. We also haven't had a Christmas party for the last 10 years. I also went to one employee barbecue and asked where the drinks were. They said ""Inside, in the vending machines."" You're telling me that the largest soda company in the world can't provide employees beverages at an employee barbecue? They also have no concept of how long things will take and always seem to be understaffed.

Sometimes the workload can be excessive and the hours long, though that tends to align with seasonal peak periods.

Incentive is an insult as there are unattainable expectations. You are capped at a bonus of around $9K per year and then they change the incentive in the qtr so you are unable to reach that #. This is appalling for a sales job for a billion dollar company for how they treat their employees. Your starting salary is extremely low for sales (I'm saying starting is approx. $34K ) for the 10 hrs of day you and headaches, not worth it. Also, you are ALWAYS on call, evenings/weekends, it never ends. Management thinks its okay to use scare tactics with the employees and everyone is afraid to speak up for fear of repercussions. No company cars, the reimbursement you receive is not enough to cover your expenses, wear/tear on vehicle. My car had so many issues from this job. Not to mention driving in terrifying weather (snow storms) because you feel forced to have to go to your customers 1. Because your customers will make you pay for it later and make your life miserable if you don't go 2. Management doesn't give you any managing advice as to what the protocol is or what to do in those situations yet they ""harp"" on ""safety"":. It's a ""get it done"" attitude. You have to carry merchandise/racks in your car which no doubt obstruct your view while driving and pose an extensive safety issue. Merchandisers were not allowed to carry racks or merch. in their car as it was considered a safety issue by the union yet the Acct. Mgr's safety does not matter? Double standard. My manager was a nightmare, young/inexperienced and downright bullying. She would speak to you like you were trash and made you fearful to ever receive a call from her. I had a great passion for working for this company when I had began and that passion was sadly killed off quickly. Not enough positive reinforcement. Employees perform better when they are told they are doing a good job. For a billion dollar company, customers nor employees hardly ever received any freebies. Getting a free case for a customer required jumping through hoops! People don't work together, constant lack of communication, disorganized working environment. You are disrespected consistently on a daily basis by management and customers. The company should not allow ANYONE to speak to their employees in a condescending or bullying manner as this is supposed to be policy but clearly not enforced by anyone. I would go home crying most days from being treated like garbage by store managers and managers. I would literally be fearful going into certain stores daily and coming face to face with these bullying managers. Useless, repetitive meetings taking place and there is no transparency nor feedback asked from employees within the company. Too much micromanaging- treat people as adults and make them feel they have a duty/sense of responsibility and they WILL be better employees and the company would prosper. Coca-Cola doesn't get how to treat their employees and what a huge impact this would have all around. Everyone is burned out & unhappy. I hope this company changes it ways for the sake of retaining their existing employees. Big name company name does not mean they do right by their employees. I learned that the hard way. I am much happier that I left that toxic working environment. I hope this review will helps someone else make the right decision when job searching.",Coca Cola

The only problem is that they hire maybe 1 out of every 10 temps so really if you work there as a temp, do not expect to get hired. Then if they do hire you, they pay you about $5-10 less than the average salary for a Project Coordinator. They pay $14/hr as a temp and $36.5K if you are made perm. When I interviewed for project coordinator positions at other companies the lowest any of them paid was $42K. Yet, i spent almost 2 years at coke doing the same job for $14/hr as a temp.

Most companies don't even offer a pension plan anymore, but Coca-Cola still does. - Free Coca-Cola Freestyle drinks at work, obviously. - Once you're a permanent associate, you basically won't get fired unless you do something really awful or just quit showing up on time.You may get laid off at some point, but you would still be eligible for re-hire.","- Micromanaging frontline managers. The people you work with make all the difference. If you have a great manager - awesome! But not every manager is great, and HR can be very slow to respond or address the issues. - Rules & Policies just for the sake of rules & policies. Some policies are at management discretion, so it's really counterproductive when they are enforced and only lead to employee dissatisfaction, i.e. enforcing a strict attendance policy in a department where employees are not depending on someone else to show up in order to be relieved. - Employee performance measurements aren't always standard across a department, and on an occasion some of the not-so-great managers will ignore quantitative data and evaluate you subjectively. That's always unfortunate. - Lack of transparency in some departments between managers and direct reports. - Lack of logical reasoning on behalf of frontline managers.

They schedule your breaks all over the place despite your schedule and expect a 93-96% adherence for schedules despite the fact that you get kicked off the phones all day and people are stuck in queues all day and super angry and it will always put you over your break times, so you are always failing in adherence. Leads and managers are rude even when you are doing very well and other CCR employees yell at you over the phone, even fellow call center reps, for transferring to them when they don't want to do their job.

Bonus numbers were impossible to reach. If you were able to match previous years numbers that was a job well done in a decling market. even if you were able to match previous numbers or exceed them, it was by such a slim margin that the bonus may be $50. You may get lucky and win a $100 gift card or something if you do a good deed or win a monthly contest between the sales reps, that was about it though. Very long and demanding hours which lead to no bonus' so you hardly ever felt rewarded. Management was brutal. Direct supervisor was a glorified big brother. Manager just complained we weren't selling enough but never offered any assistance or suggestions. Training was also non existent, essentially walk in the first day and get thrown to the wolves. if you don't mind working long hours for just a base salary then you will do fine. or if you are in it just for the health insurance that is also another reason to stay. Otherwise you cant take all the stress to heart or they will eat you up and you will be miserable. my advice would be to show up daily, do your best, put in your hours and go home and forget about work because they don't pay enough for you to be putting in 15-16 hour days answering customers afterhours and on weekends.",Coca Cola

What they can't seem to understand is that it is near to impossible to increase dales every year in a down turned economy. So their solution is to reinvent the wheel avery year in order to try a different approach which ultimately just builds irritation and frustration within the staff. Everyone wants to sell more, everyone has money on the line with there bonus but the company's solutios often makes it more difficult instead of easier. There is obviously a lot of wasted money floating up top while lay offs happen down below. Its a shame because this company used to be a great representation of what America could do. Now they are so worried about being sued by any minority they want to terminate for poor performance and yet tries their hardest to hire as many as possible despite the difficulty in letting go of the bad seeds.

2251,"""Field IT was Outsourced""",3.0,"Got to touch/support many technology areas like telephony, handhelds, mobile computing, servers, security systems, bottling and monitoring systems, wireless infrastructure, windows and macintosh, as400. Coca-Cola North America decided to lay off/outsource its most of its generalist and specialist support functions in order to focus on its core business roles and processes. Coca-Cola gave advance notice and also paid severance to the laid off employees. Outsourcing support functions may force Coca-Cola to simplify and standardize IT systems which could reduce cost and increase reliability. This may be a good place for someone starting out in IT but it is likely that you will need to do it as a contractor.","Coca-Cola would not pay for IT industry certification tests, even if the employee did all the studying at their own cost (tried several times but Microsoft and Comptia IT certification tests do not count as 'tuition' so the forms always came back as denied). Coca-Cola could not validate previous employment when needed for background checks by new employer. They outsourced that function to a company called 'The Work Number' where supposedly a background check could verify your previous employment dates at Coca-Cola. This seems like it should save money for Coca-Cola (since the party seeking the employment history pays), but in practice this is a failure. I had to contact Coke HR anyway to get several 'employer codes' to try with 'The Work Number' so it would probably have just been easier to have HR provide a letter saying I had worked for coke from xx/xx/xxxx to xx/xx/xxxx. Then my new employer paid 'The Work Number' to get results but was told I only worked there 1 year?? Got a different employer code from Coke but they would have to pay to run the check again. Workaround is to just show your new employer your previous tax records showing you worked at Coke from xx/xx/xxxx to xx/xx/xxxx. Support can be convoluted because of having to work with multiple outside companies to get a problem solved for an internal employee. A good example would be a broadband connection on a handheld computer that gets administratively turned off because it was misassigned to the wrong user. There is a company that handles the laptop record and hardware replacement, another company that manages the broadband records, then five more carriers that provide the actual broadband service based on what carriers are available per geographic region.",Coca Cola

PLEASE READ THIS: To start: I've seen WHITE FOLKS discriminating against other WHITE FOLKS. Now that give you a 1st impression how bad it will be if you not even white. (ohh don't worry, you probably will never even feel it, the fake smile, & the awesome fake laugh, you'd think everyone loooovesss you) Many of YOU agree to the temp to hire under the assumption the pay is fair, but believe me there is absolutely NOTHING fair about the pay. Yes the job is a headache just like any other but there is a lot more worse than job the itself. 1) The people/management who doesn't even know how to spell excel but wants a 97% 2)COKE SAVE $10,000 ON HEALTH INSURANCE PER PERSON IF YOU A TEMP- (Hint) you'd never be a Permanent, they will fire you & take on the next TEMP. 3)in 2 years, i counted a total of 38 temps, only 1 get hired (Ratio of Madness) 4) talking about fairness, wait till you get a portfolio of 4000 accounts & demanded to put it a 97% can you make 4000 calls in a month and get all issue resolved? the average person can only make barely 200 calls, & stay on top of emails an issues, so you do the math. 5) do you ever get sick, can you predict an accident, or a flat tire, do you have kids...JUST DON'T DO IT. COKE WILL LET YOU GO IN A BLANK OF AN EYE.","Don't do Temp with coca-cola at all. Even if you a French speaker the ratio does not change for you. I know what we all think: Ohh yes, I am good working, I worked hard, ect.. ect.. I've been there for 2 years, and I saw 38 people come as temp and only 1 got hired. 1/38 is HELL OF A RATIO. (oh make no mistake they will work the hell out of you and LET YOU GO AFTER 4 MONTHS & GET ANOTHER TEMP) now you wonder at least there is one, wait till you find out he knew an ex-coworker who got promoted to supervisor that help him out to become permanent. The place is simply BAD. horrible place to work and it's mostly the people. Coke will take advantage of anybody smart, capable they can find to put as temp but they will NEVER hire you simply because they SAVE $10,000 on insurance per person if you a temp. Bottom line it's not even YOU per se. you show up to work every day, but if you get in a car accident that is your problem, meanwhile the multi - BILLION dollar company you working for doesn't even have the decency to offer you health insurance, why...because you a temp. so they saving money on you, why they will through another $10,000 for insurance and pick you up as temp? some people show up at Coca-cola as a TEMP and said; ""I am so good they will pick me up in 2 weeks"" believe me, about 10 of them did not last the rest of the week.
