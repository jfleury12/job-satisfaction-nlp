You can earn so much more if you work a lot of weekends - Culture is all about being yourself, so you can be POC or LGBTQ+ and be in a welcome environment - Great benefits for health and dental, onsite medical and therapy - Certification discounts for any Cisco Certifications - Can use up all your PTO straight if you like, some people take a month off at a time - Good place to start for either those getting started in their career, or those that want to get their CCIE in a product. This is the fastest way to learn.","- You only learn the product you're meant to support, rarely the entire solution - No learning resources for the product you're supposed to support on smaller teams/products - Company is excited to promote products, then lay off team members *FOR* that product - Quarterly layoffs, but yearly promotion cycles - Weekend shifts are voluntold to you if you're on a smaller team, and aren't necessarily on a cycle (and you can expect to work every weekend. I just worked 2 months straight with 6/7 day weeks) - Business Unit/Escalation team will withhold information from TAC, which can keep us from being able to do our jobs - Any training will be sales training, and not support training, which means we won't know how to fix/tshoot problems any more than when we started. - The products we support are upsold and underdeveloped. You'll constantly find yourself saying ""that feature isn't supported until a future release, even though the buttons are there and the documentation says how to set it up. Please don't use it as it's not production ready."" - Burnout/turnover is high. It's nonstop when you work for Cisco. Don't expect to take time to study at home unless it's your passion, as everyone was usually too mentally drained at the end of the day. - Any time to study for certifications on smaller teams is impossible due to the sheer amount of work to do. On larger teams you can get time off the queue to study with management approval. Personal Experience: Was strung along for two years about a promotion, contributing to python IC and being the top case taker, but was still told ""I can't promote you yet, even though you're at a starting pay grade. Next cycle, though."" After being told that 3 times, and seeing two layoffs in two quarters, I broke out the resume. Because of all of the above, you'll find yourself working in situations where different levels of upper management will start to have daily calls on how to keep customers from pulling Cisco from their deployment, when in reality the product just wasn't ready to be sold to them.",Cisco

28,"""Enjoyed the work, detested the manager politics""",3.0,"Telecommute, worked with global team colleagues, my team always had each other's back ALWAYS.","~45% of Cisco workers are ""contingent"" (contract); the majority should be full-time employees. Too many managers are way too political and are here for their own self gains even by stepping on employees who work for them, my level of trust with most managers was low; I will say I had 2 managers I would follow to the end of world (one was a Sr Director and one was a Sr Manager - fabulous, this was 6 years ago and they are now gone, they had 20 years at Cisco). Some managers I questioned (to myself no one else) why they had their role and it was clear they had connections and were ""covered"". I've been in IT for over 25 years and Cisco is the worse I've ever seen. I have this love/hate relationship: 1) I need to telecommute (EXCELLENT) due to family; 2) Cisco treats employees as replaceable cogs (BAD) in a machine, raises may take 3-5 years to get one. Yeah, it's a right to work environment, this isn't Cuba. If I'm expected to be loyal and jump when they say jump, I expect management to do a better job of supporting their charges.

I feel I am very fairly compensated for the work I do but mostly feel a strong loyalty to Cisco for how I've been able to achieve an amazing work/life balance through taking advantage of remote working. I've always worked for managers many states away, communicating regularly but not too often, by Cisco's HD video technology. I've never been micromanaged and always been empowered to work when, where and how I choose as long as I am performing and excelling at my deliverables. This has allowed me to very successfully transition in to my new life as a working mom where unlike most of my friends I haven't had to make the choice between career and present parenting. I can truly do both, even as a breastfeeding mother and didn't have to take a single step back. Maternity leave was ridiculously generous and long enough that I actually felt excited to come back to work (especially since I work from home near my baby and nanny). The other perks for new moms that Cisco provides are over the top generous between milk stork, $100 lactation store credit, stuffed animals and baby books mailed to my home, free lactation consultant, and more. So thankful for Cisco and the wonderful career, no, wonderful LIFE, working here has afforded me. No reason I wouldn't spend my whole career here as I believe these benefits are unique to Cisco in the tech world. Speaking of the actual work I've always been empowered and encouraged to pursue new and interesting opportunities across many departments and job titles. I've always been promoted and given raises before I even thought to ask for them.

They always try to make it sound like it's for business reasons, but it's still surprising as Cisco seem to meeting their goals for the last few years. They typically do it so they can get rid of higher grade folks, hire lower grade folks or contractors and bank the savings. Even with nice severance packages, they net out in the positive. Middle management is horrific. After good management left, my team was left in shambles and leadership slowly drove team away one by one and then blamed everyone else. Lots of politics. Many managers will devise ways to get rid of those who don't agree with their opinions by withholding bonuses, prevent any movement to other teams, uncomfortable 1-1 conversations, etc. Also the division between FTEs and contractors is very apparent and the pay disparity is embarrassing as are the benefits (read none).

My first 7 years were with a business unit where I had a great experience and was appreciated and promoted several times. Management was supportive and seemed truly invested in my career development and work/life balance. Development was team oriented with lots of collaboration and support from peers. Then I made an unfortunate lateral move to another business unit in another city with some major issues I did not anticipate. Engineering staff there had serious morale issues. My peers were constantly ""joking"" about how terrible the product we were all working on was. At first I wondered why nobody did anything to just fix the issues. After working there a while I realized it was because the engineers have practically zero ability to effect change in the product. So the senior engineers there are basically just going through the motions because the pay is pretty good, the benefits are basically second to none, and they don't want to lose that. Meanwhile the younger engineers are leaving because the environment is pretty awful. Having your own hard-wall office seems great at first until you realize you hardly ever collaborate with the people on your team. On my project the standard practice was to assign a single engineer to develop a feature, write tests, and perform QA in practical isolation. As you can imagine this was pretty stressful and didn't work very well, resulting in buggy products due to lack of a dedicated QA team. Asking for help on an engineering issue was usually like pulling teeth because you had to pull other engineers away from their work to collaborate. Management was not receptive of suggestions to change the status quo to alleviate these issues. My manager frequently missed our weekly one-on-one meetings, sometimes for several weeks in a row. When I attempted to reschedule these missed meetings my requests were frequently ignored.

These employee organizations are communities that help you grow personally and professionally by connecting you with others who share similar interests and come from similar backgrounds. It is a chance to experience the wonderful diversity that exists within Cisco . Lastly, the flexibility that Cisco has is unmatched. For example, just this past Thanksgiving Holiday I fell ill and not well enough to go into the office. Luckily, with our flexible working policies and my agreement with my manager, I was able to work the entire week from home – no missed meetings!","Aforementioned, Cisco is a large company where success is emphasized by maintaining one’s own personal network and development. You have your roles and responsibilities but an added layer of continuous self-improvement through development courses and scoping careers on Cisco’s career site that might fit with your skillset. In other words, any role at Cisco won’t be an 8am-5pm Monday-Friday set-schedule job – but it will be as good as you make it!",Cisco

595,"""Great comp plan for high-end engineers;don't plan on a long term career here""",4.0,"The benefits are outrageously good. The compensation is outrageously good. If you are a survivor you will do well here. If you are a high performer, you will do financially well here. If you slack, you may actually do better than the high performers as management keeps the slackers around to cut them every 6 months when LRs are mandated. When you are impacted by an LR and you will be, you earn a great exit package (I earned one year of base pay for 4 years of work...) The DCP is pretty cool for 13/89s, but on reflection, if I knew Cisco was such an unstable company, I'd not had invested in the DCP program as now all my DCP is paid in one big chunk in one year instead of spread over several years as I had planned. Live and learn :)","Cisco's definition of culture in my brief 4-year stint was ""everything is about money"". That is good and bad - good because you can make some serious dough here, bad because there is no sense of community in the workforce. Cisco has limited restructurings in spring and fall. The lifers refer to avoiding a layoff as ""being safe"" which is in my mind an oxymoron. There is no such thing as safety at Cisco. If you come here, be prepared to move on when you hit the wrong set of cost lists. High performance is no guarantee of ""safety"" either; I earned 1.3x-1.5x multipliers on my bonuses every year for 4 years - still impacted by an LR. Most restructuring affects older (highly compensated) workers. There is no other logical conclusion to the restructurings than they are meant to cut already well-trained long-term growth employees and replace them with a younger untrained workforce. These LRs create intense stop energy in the company nearly all the time as everyone is in a state of panic. This ""Fog of War"" is difficult for innovators to execute in making Cisco pivot like an Exxon Valdez rather than an Eagle. Cisco completely doesn't understand open source and evidenced by the latest round of LRs in 2018 that impacted nearly every engineer doing any sort of open source work. The engineering workforce is far too compliant resulting in high degrees of passive-aggressive behavior rather than assertiveness.",Cisco

Cisco celebrates diversity and has “ERO” groups to connect people of different backgrounds with each other. As an Air Force veteran, I am a member of the “Veteran ERO” and am always uplifted by the many initiatives and opportunities we have to celebrate our fellow Veterans and fallen Heroes. Lastly, I have never been at a company that has such an incredible culture of lifting each other up! We all need help and advice at times (in technology, probably more often than in other industries!). Most other companies have a few people you know will help you and not make you feel like a burden. At Cisco, it is RARE to find someone who is not overly eager to help, point you to someone who will help, or help you find the right resources. It is humbling to ask a question and immediately be in touch with someone who authored the book on a subject! As a large and successful corporation, benefits are very good and employees are given the necessary resources to succeed. We work on the newest technologies, with modern processes that help Cisco (and us as employees) to stay ahead of the curve!","If you are not accustomed to change, you may have some challenge getting used to work at Cisco. Our leadership does a great job of staying relevant in the industry (our market share and market cap shows this). To do this, we are in a constant state of change. You basically have to hold on tight and enjoy the ride!",Cisco

715,"""Great place to work if you can own your career.""",5.0,"I have had a great experience at Cisco for the past 6 years, moving from contracted employee (red badge) to full time (blue badge). Full Time means much less of the 9-5 hourly requirements that contractors have and a job based on deliverables and owning your time. By that I mean I have flexibility to set my schedule to make child drop off, personal time and other scheduling things without managers approval as long as I am staying on task. The ability to access the huge amount of Cisco and 3rd party training for free as an employee has been a major bonus. The yearly benefits like health/dental/vision, matching 401k and stock program are of high value. If you work at the larger offices (San Jose or RTP) the onsite amenities (cafe, gym, medical, etc) are top notch. Salary can vary widely, but I feel they are consistent with tech companies in the area. The annual bonus is split into 50% in the Spring and 50% in the Fall. Bonus is dependent on Company and personal performance. Employees are encourages to give each other recognition from $25-$500 in the form of a gift card for a job well done. I do value the way we treat customers and follow up to solve problems. We do the right thing and I would not be here if that was not the case. There are plenty of alternative careers within the company if you feel the need for change. Managers will support your path from my experience.","You can get lost if you do not focus on your skills and creating visibility to your work. There is always an org change on the horizon, so you may change managers and job titles often. There are layoffs about once every 1-2 years. They can target the whole company or specific organizations. They will feel harsh and not based on performance and value, but the company is always changing and answers to shareholders.

New programs to promote diversity and inclusion seem to pop-up every 3 months, but gender equality is all talk. More women are laid off than men every cycle, and promotions for women come at one quarter of the pace to men. (This is more likely due to the extremely low percentage of women in general) 3. Age discrimination is rampant. Seniority (or experience) matters for nothing - new employees (usually through start-up acquisitions) are consistently favored over long-time employees for new positions. 9/10 times younger employees are not 'restructured' given that they are comparatively inexpensive and generally easy to relocate (if need be).

Managers did not agree and I had a conflict with them. 3- The company has VERY high turnover from employees and contractors. its not easy to deal with too many changes per day and week and month. 4- They keep acquiring companies and its tough to focus on your role since every other quarter there is a new re-org and new policies. 5-The work pace is TOOOO FAST and the company has TOOOO MANY customer accounts and they expect you to over perform and do your 150%. All the team members and your other colleagues are not easy to meet and talk with them. Every thing is Webex and ALl the workers are overloaded with work. 6- Its nice to have many Tools to help you do your work like webex etc BUT its overused with all the teams. for example if you ask any question about anything they team member will answer you with list of ALL the webex recordings and links by the time you want to watch them and understand the answer that is like a week worth of things and the team member thinks he did the write think for you but really he gave you Major new work. 7- Too many trainings, by the team you do your internal meeting (physical or webes), then you calls, then your huge list of links and webex recordings its really tough to achieve during your day since all these things take your time and you may have time later on the day to do some of your work. 8- There are SO many feedbacks on you during the week and after each sessions etc etc you need to be always connected with the team and it feels that you ONLY live for Cisco there is nothing else to do in this life. 9-I have never seen a company that asks their sales team commitment calls to be WEEKLY. So the sales team are in MAJOR stress and they stress the other teams with them. 10- Unless you like that type of env and CONTINUES work , then I don't recommend that company for people with Family and kids and social life. I noticed most people working very long hours from 8am until OPEN. 11- Cisco has many products (old, new, acquired, etc) and once you join, they will buy new company and then new products. Most of these products work in theory but in real life and at customer site its REALLY complicated and tough and they may work but with a lot of difficulties and many Cisco internal teams involvements. its Tough technical env. with all these complications. 12- Cisco were a hardware company and trying to switch to software company and that is difficult and too many challenges especially they don't have the software company mindset.",Cisco

Other people say Cisco has good work life balance. I think it depends on what product you are working on. I feel like I am under a lot of stress generally and put in a lot of hours. I have been at Cisco over 10 years and there haven't been a lot of breaks. Many of my coworkers work from home at least a couple days a week, especially after they moved us to an open floor plan. The people I work with are for the most part friendly, smart and professional. I love making killer products that make billions of dollars of revenue each year. I learn new things constantly and feel challenged.","At least in engineering, there is not a supportive environment for women. There is lack of education among the first line managers how to promote respect and give air time to all type of people, and to promote, give opportunities, listen to and value the ideas of women. And there is some blatant sexism. For example, when I had my baby, my manager told me the 'right' thing to do was to become a stay at home mom. And despite making a sacrificial effort to perform well my first year with a baby, my manager said he gave me an average rating because I had a baby. His perception was colored by my being a mother. I thought I deserved a higher rating for an exceptional year. And he asked me what are my priorities, my child or my job? He didn't ask my male coworkers this question. Even now, he 'forgets' to give me a bonus even though he gave every other report of his one (who are all male). In the previous two layoffs, the only persons he laid off were women. He asks me to plan the fun group outings, not my male colleagues. On separate occasions, my director and my VP asked me to take minutes when there were plenty of men available to also take minutes. Many of my female coworkers moved on because of the frustration of not having their opinions valued as much as our male coworkers. It's a tough problem to solve because people come to Cisco from many types of backgrounds, but I feel there is no management support from any level of the management chain except for Chuck and his direct reports. Open space floorplan is distracting visually and audially. The space is so tight that the moveable whiteboards are not near our desks.

Services is losing talent for several years because of these disparities &amp; scores of extremely good engineers and first line managers have moved out for money. 2) Promo cycles are a myth. It is not uncommon for people to work their @ss off for several years in a row just to be told that either the much awaited promo/equity cycle did not happen, or it was too little to mean anything. By the way, this happens right after massive promos in senior management layer. 3) Management keeps cramming more work into the job role every few months - for no extra dime. Engineers besides learning and supporting their technologies &amp; customers are asked to cross train with other technologies, learn scripting, automate processes, create content, help improve product quality. If engineers don’t invest their personal time there is no way they can meet these unrealistic expectations. 4) Outsourcing has brought morale to a new low. Tremendous amount of services work got moved south of the border in last three years. There is no concrete communication from upper management whether or not they want services' employees in US to thrive or to look out.",Cisco

Cisco acquired our company; and with any acquisition by a large multinational corporation, there is some wonder about how the culture will change. I was very happy the last 3 ½ years to see the culture became even better. The Executive Leadership Team (ELT) is serious about executing on our core strategy and “The People Deal”. People ask me how I like working at Cisco…I love it! We work like a small start-up in my business unit, with the encouragement to Be Bold and take risks in Innovation; however, there is the power and strength of over 70,000 people working with you for the same goals. It is awesome to travel all over the globe and have your Cisco badge work in hundreds of locations. As an out LGBTQ person, I have found Cisco to be such a welcome and inviting place to work. Some highlights include, welcoming my same-sex spouse as part of the greater family; great health care benefits; Time2Give, where I volunteer 40 hours a year at LGTBQ non-profit organizations; Community Giving, where Cisco matches my donations to LGTBQ non-profit organizations and pays them $10 an hour for my volunteer service (for time above Time2Give time off); a strong LGBTQ & Allies employee resource organization with a private Facebook group & quarterly global meetings; Lesbian Lunch & Allies monthly meeting in San Jose; paying for my attendance at LesbiansWhoTech Summit in 2015; the ELT taking a public stand against discrimination on social media & in the press; Cisco signing the UN policy about diversity in the Workplace; and on and on. At a LGBTQ & Allies global PRIDE WebEx, a sales person in the UK asked an executive about being in the closet with his customers, worried he might not be able to make his quota if a customer knew he was gay and would not want to do business with him. The executive answered, “We obviously must have hired you because you are the best at what you do in your region. You represent Cisco. If they don’t want to do business with you, then we don’t want to do business with them.” I am grateful and proud to be part of the Cisco Family. #WeAreCisco #LoveWhereYouWork","Like any large corporations, there can be too many persons involved in approvals for public facing messaging.

As a Veteran of the Marine Corps with 29-years of service, I was concerned that a civilian company would not share the same values or have a level of camaraderie even close to that of a military organization. I was very wrong. I have found that and more here at Cisco.","Open working areas can be more collaborative but not appropriate for all practice areas, such as areas that may require sensitive HR or Legal type discussions. Although there are Privacy Rooms available, having to search one out due to an impromptu meeting or call is counter productive.",Cisco

1662,"""You're on your own (that's good and bad)""",4.0,"You're given the tools you need to do your job and you're entrusted to ""do the right thing"" (that was in the orientation). There's a complete absence of micromanagement -- no one will tell you what to do, though they will sometimes provide guidance if asked, or as part of regular team operations. Work/life balance is great; everyone is given a CVO to support working from home, which can be expected when you're working with teams all around the world.","Everyone is doing their own thing. Sometimes the pieces come together to make a functioning product/service, but only at the lowest levels. The higher you go, the less likely it is that what you're working on will play nicely with what someone else is working on, and there is little broad leadership to tie all of the pieces together.",Cisco

Very strong culture. Nurtures groups for comradery (example Connected Black Professionals - CBP). Work with some the best brightest minds. Lots of training and personal development opportunities if you need/seek them. Very socially responsible. Great community giveback support and programs.","Operates on the cheap from a T&E perspective. Not place where they help you chart your career path. The opportunities are abound but you must take ownership of your career. Would like to see more minorities in the senior leadership. That said, Chuck, Chris and the likes have always made me feel that they are picking the best people for the leadership team.",Cisco

1670,"""Fantastic colleagues, great culture, jury is out on corporate strategy""",5.0,"Smart people everywhere. Non-hierarchical culture, good ideas from anywhere can get attention and support. Best flexible work practices in the industry, hands down. Cisco really walks the talk and shows how a virtual corporate culture can flourish and pay off. New benefit offerings also speak volumes about how they care for the whole employee - longer paid bonding leaves for parents and grandparents, flexible emergency time off policy that each manager can tailor to meet their employee's needs, Time2Give which provides a full extra week of paid time off per calendar year to volunteer for a non-profit or educational institution of the employee's choice (above and beyond any team volunteering and give back events).","Cisco did not act quickly enough to shift its business model when AWS and other cloud vendors became threats. Now we are playing catch-up. Don't get me wrong, we have ALL the resources needed to win the catch-up game: cash on hand, transformation strategy, excellent CFO explaining it to the street, excellent people... But we have some things that could drag us down: sheer size (lack of agility), continued success in high-margin core business (hard to decide to cannibalize yourself), high-level leaders who have been around too long, have too internal a view, little outside experience and who have succeeded too long in the old way to be willing to jump quickly to innovative strategies or new business models.",Cisco

Good benefits.","Depending on the business unit, you may be asked to save the world with d t tape and baling wire. Running WAY too lean.
