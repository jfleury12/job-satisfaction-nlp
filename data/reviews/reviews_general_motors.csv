321,General Motors,"Too many to list them all, but here are a few: 1) No other company will disappoint you faster and harder. You will go from 60 (great company, I’m proud to work here) to 0 (I’m ashamed of working here) faster than a hyper car. 2) No matter how much money you made for the company, or how much experience you bring, or what unique skill set you possess, or how many extra hours you voluntarily worked to make your boss look good, or how many rave reviews you get from the business and your co-workers, if you are not part of the inner circle of your Director, you will never, ever, get a fair year-end review, and you will be eventually let go in the most embarrassing of ways. 3) The cronyism in IT leadership is cynical and disgusting. There is no way you will advance your career or get promoted if you are not one of the good old boys’ club. I saw many people doing absolutely nothing for the company get better reviews than many of us who were really impacting the bottom line with our work. 4) When you are being hired, they sell you the idea that this company is so huge that opportunities will jump out of everywhere and you can move to other areas if you are not happy where you are. This is a lie. They are willing to let you go before they move you. 5) Managers/Directors are the worst I’ve had to work with in my 20+ year long career. Most of them lack basic people skills, not to mention managing skills. No transparency at all, and always with hidden agendas. 6) Leadership is concerned about costs and will lay off thousands, but at the same time they are the main waste generators. I saw projects thrown out the door after a year of working on them, with labor and hardware resources already paid for; you can see many managers with one or zero people under them; hundreds of people doing nothing, waiting for projects to be approved, especially when you are a new hire. Months can come and go before you get to work on something. 7) They call themselves “IT Innovators”, but nothing is further than the truth. There is no innovation, only poor attempts at imitation. Don’t fall for the “zero crashes, zero emissions… zero everything” hype. With this IT leadership it simply just won’t happen. How could it, when basic essential processes that could be easily automated are still being managed by pen and paper? Read the news and follow the competition and you will see who really is leading in this area. 8) Worst of all, your career and skill set will come to a screeching halt. They will freeze in time. Due to the red tape, favoritism, or just plain ignorance of the decision makers, you have to work with only the technology approved by them. After leaving, many of us are now facing the reality that all of the latest technology trends that are in demand in the job market are not the ones used here. Getting a job offer will be harder for you if you stay too long in this company, because you will not have the experience with the latest technologies. Lastly, trust the bad reviews. They are closer to reality than the good ones.

326,General Motors,"Long detailed list, bare with me please: -The true reason that you will work under several teams/orgs is that you will get pulled into a job somebody quit or nobody wants. Management will not care about if that change reflects your expertise/career goals and there will be a lot of deflection as to who even initiated this change (your direct manager, HR, or a Director). On the other hand if you attempt to make a lateral movement to another position available - good luck. Logically, the ""good"" jobs/roles rarely open up because people fight to stay in those teams. -The true ""Innovation"" apps at GM are Outlook and Skype (Excel is third). They are management's best friends. GM uses boring old vendor software but creates even more boring in-house software (yikes). Over 50% of GM software is legacy software written by people no longer there with non-existent/poor documentation. Legacy apps break ALL.THE.TIME. Many times it's because it's inexplicably linked to another app/server because ""it sounded like a good idea"" a long time ago. -Bureaucracy is the boogey-man word and Director-level management refuses to accept there exists so much of it. Bureaucracy to install software. Bureaucracy for servers to apps you own. Bureaucracy for production deployments. You will have meetings with people who will stonewall and will bring 2 other people in the call to act as witnesses for their justification. Being proactive will only get you assigned more work and will cause you to become the SME of 3 MORE legacy apps in addition to the 5 you already own. Because of this, teams will actually allow software to break/deadlines to be unmet (with the ""secret"" blessing of managers). Deadlines are constantly made/promised by people who have never been software developers/engineers. -Out of the 4 IT ""Innovation"" Centers: Austin and Warren are substantially better especially for your career growth. They get more ""visibility"" and have better projects (again, depends on team). GM focuses too much on Galileo, myGM Rewards, AVT, and MAVEN while disregarding the apps that provide POSITIVE net cash inflows. It seems like other teams exist only to not disturb upper-management by preventing P1/P2's. The message is ""Helping the client/customer great but preferably focus on preventing P1/P2's"". Now, if your team did meet that metric of ""No P1/P2's for the Mid-year Performance Review""...you still won't get recognized. There exists considerable, outsourcing for apps that GM, itself doesn't believe its employees are qualified to do (ex: AVT). GM avoids open-source software and it has become detrimental to its goal of ""innovation"". Lots of soul-draining repetitive tasks and most of it involves Outlook (aka management's BF). Before you realize, you will have lost knowledge/skills you had in the past. -Beware of the IT organizations that have the word ""Global"" in their name. They contain ALL the negatives listed above (such as legacy software) on a larger scale. No exception. The Directors in ""Global"" orgs also are uninspiring, feign transparency, and lack direction (can't have direction when your org consists of projects that aren't innovating/ provide little to the customer). No surprise I saw more turnover in these orgs than other orgs. -Most of the discontent is towards Randy Mott's network he brought from Dell and HP (CIO's and especially Directors). Perhaps some of them have quit/were layed-off but for years they ushered in bad practices, bad vendors and fostered nepotism. If you want to ""moveup"" at GM, learn to take data of all the cost-savings you provided into Excel-format, only then you can communicate in a language they comprehend. -Not as important as the statements listed above^ but GM has lots of synonym and acronym entities/programs/software that sound alike but are ACTUALLY different things (EX: GM Loyalty/GM Rewards/GM Recognition, Chevy Volt/Bolt, ITOC SE/ITOC SD)","-IT Innovations centers, you are likely to work under several teams and orgs if you stay over a year -Raises are great for salaried New College Hires (4.4%) although it's less for other salaried employees -HDHP Insurance (which is great if you never use it OR if you go WAY beyond the deductible) -Dental &amp; HSA (1.5k contribution) are amazing -401k is amazing (if you complete vesting period) -Lots of PTO (can't save unused PTO though) and company-wide holidays/days off (especially December) -Majority of Coworkers are very approachable and genuinely want to help -Cute titles such as Release Engineer, Messaging Engineer, Operations Engineer etc. -Company makes an effort to improve employee discontent (ex: GM Recognition program) -Less outsourcing and many successful in-house IT projects (there still exits some outsourcing though) -Innovation centers are located in suburbs, plenty of housing options (although this can be a Con if you want to live near downtown area) -Job can be greatly beneficial to grow your knowledge and skills (depends heavily on your org AND manager)",3.0,"""Relaxed work-life balance, Co-workers are Supportive but Job can be Unfulfilling, Limited 'Innovation'"""

328,General Motors,"I worked in GMIT for 4 years. I no longer do.

GM likes to pretend (lie) that not having a defined technical career plan speaks to the various career opportunities that you will encounter at GM. In reality, out of my 4 years at GM, i saw a grand total of TWO people in my org (about 150 people) get promoted. The rest stayed in same position, switched teams, or left GM altogether. Many of the people in my org who I respected as brilliant engineers inevitably leave GM for greener pastures. (2) GM doesn't appreciate IT. They talk a lot about having a vision of GM as a tech company while simultaneously offering none of the perks of tech companies and certainly nowhere close to the salary (esp in Austin, a growing tech hub). Pay for coffee, pay for food at ""lunch &amp; learn"" event, etc (3) Many of your colleagues in GMIT will be low-performers and you will often have to clean up after them. This is largely due to the complete absence of technical questions during the interview. It's all personality questions. So you end up working with people who are polite and incapable of innovation. (4) Many teams don't follow best practices for software development. Code review, continuous integration, blue-green deploy, unit testing, etc .... completely absent on many teams. Your skills will actually end up deteriorating if you're not careful (even as a college grad with a clean slate mind) . Imagine going to an interview for your next job and saying ""we didn't write unit tests"" - who would want to hire that engineer ?

Company is so obsessed with cutting costs at the expense of employee benefits and well being that you will get mocked for asking where to find Kleenex when you have a cold (the answer I was given: “there’s a CVS downstairs as you know...”) or for ANY supplies or tools beyond a laptop and spotty internet connection (when asking for file folders and a place to put paperwork related to my work, was belittled for suggesting piling everything I’d need for my job on the table top that posed as my desk was not sufficient, and was forced to use research tools and subscriptions provided by my recent alma mater to do my job after requesting and being denied access to information resources beyond what I could google- including subscriptions my manager had access to but refused to share due to the aforementioned sorority culture). Basically you are being set up to fail, and unless you have an engineering degree and/or amazing contacts in the auto industry you’re screwed once they’ve tricked you into moving to Detroit only to find out working for GM is nothing like what it’s marketed to be, from culture to benefits to the impact and mission of the work.",Company obviously has good name recognition with prospective future employers,1.0,"""Dysfunctional and uber political"""

Too many meetings where nothing gets accomplished which begets more meetings... and the cycle continues. Poor company culture - the emphasis on safety in everything seems to be widely ignored at multiple levels in both personal safety and product development. I personally experienced quite a bit of stress and frustration trying to convince middle management of a safety issue that needed addressing before I (and a few others) were taken seriously. On the personal safety side, the rule about not using cellphones while walking is widely violated and managers are too timid to enforce it (actually, managers break this rule as much as everyone else). Some people who work there are convinced that they are the end all/be all of engineering, and their personalities can be described as abrasive.

Developer's Life is a complete mess, everything is slowly being pushed to developers (Testing, Operations). PLEASE AVOID GM IT IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE, IT'S A TRAP!",Good benefits and decent pay.,1.0,"""Software Developer"""
603,General Motors,"Career advancement - While there are a lot of great learning opportunities in the early stages of an IT career, your prospects dry up fast after about 3 years. GM IT has a horrible habit of burning out top talent - if you establish yourself as a dedicated, talented employee, you are more likely to get stuck with the same work over and over again until you are hating life, rather than interesting, high visibility projects to advance your career because your manager only cares about the bottom line. If you think you can just switch teams think again - constant political battles between middle management make it very difficult to change to a job you'd rather do. And even if you do make the switch, you'll likely mess up your chances for a promotion or have to take a pay cut because HR has way too much control over employee compensation and makes it really hard to get a pay raise. They (HR) recently established quotas for the number of people in each organization that can be at a certain pay/benefit grade, and most teams are over the line so 90% of employees are stuck at their current level, by default. I've seen a lot of people quit recently because they were approved for promotions (sometimes by directors and/or executives) but were denied by HR (a lot of them were women, what's up with that Mary Barra?) who cite ""policy"". Perks - Although GM's traditional benefits are very good, a lot of the perks you'd expect to see with a huge car company are just not there. You don't get a company car unless you are a senior manager or higher, and even then you'll likely get stuck with something clunky that GM can't sell. Only the executives get the ""cool"" cars. There used to be an awesome program where more junior employees could try out cars for a week, but the company took it away to cut costs. This really sucks because employee discounts on GM cars are embarrasingly bad - most people use standard retail discounts because they are actually better. Culture - GM recruiters sell the IT department as a ""tech startup funded by a multi-billion dollar corporation"". In reality, it's more like a ""large consulting firm under long term contract with GM"" in that there's very little of the aggressive, innovative culture that you would see in a startup. Red tape is everywhere - you need 3 to 5 approvals just to get read-only access to a non-secret production database for example. The more established you get, the more time you'll spend in endless meetings, which usually results in worse work-life balance because you end up doing most of your real work after hours. The rest of GM hasn't really embraced IT either...you'll spend about as much time selling your work as you do actually doing it. Middle Management - Middle management and tech leads are, by and large, awful. There's a few exceptions but most of them are petty, lazy, and constantly playing politics. Many of the ones in Austin have been working together for 20+ years, so there's a lot of nepotism and playing favorites. A lot of the reason for the career advancement logjam that I mentioned before is because some of the managers brought in ""paid friends"" from other companies at job grades way higher than they deserve, so they are enjoying high pay and company cars for very little output and preventing other people from getting promoted. If you aren't part of that culture and don't pay homage to the old boys club, forget about gaining any sort of career clout. Many of them have a consulting mindset and tend to overpromise to the business, signing up their developers for work they either don't know how to do or don't have time for (or both), and which usually doesn't deliver much value or isn't functional, but ""it's what the business wants and we have to do as we are told...so...¯\_(ツ)_/¯"". Many of them also get road rage in the parking lot and on commutes - we are constantly going over safety messages because the company cars are always getting wrecked or getting tickets for bad driving. Infrastructure - GM's IT architecture is ancient, cheap, and something is almost always broken. This can make it really hard to test and deploy code because you'll often have to wait until environments are less busy or fixed in order to do your work. The old Austin IT facility was a former Dell building and was a great work environment. Lots of natural light, bright colors, and open air. The company is moving Austin IT to a new building, and it feels like a massive downgrade. It's an old warehouse which is very obvious. Exposed piping/wiring everywhere, exposed insulation on the ceilings which periodically falls on you, very few windows, drab and grey walls and floors, HOLES IN THE FLOOR UNDER THE CARPET and generally not ergonomic or safe. All the ""renovations"" feel very rushed and cheaply done. Even basic things like bathroom plumbing and water fountains barely work.","DISCLAIMER - This review is specific to IT in Austin, Texas. GM is a massive global company and each location, department, and team has a different culture. Benefits - GM's traditional benefits are some of the best you'll get anywhere. Healthcare is very comprehensive and includes an awesome wellness incentive program, and the 401K is probably one of the best of any company in any industry. You'll get a lot of the usual stuff too - corporate discounts, company merch, etc. Compensation - Pay is certainly not bad, but can vary in competitiveness by location. IT jobs aren't scaled by how valuable skills are in their respective markets so every gets paid pretty much the same. This is great for the Detroit and Phoenix offices but isn't great in Atlanta and is not competitive in Austin. The company is trying to fix this and has adjusted starting salary for junior employees to be more competitive (although they are hoping more experienced ones will not notice I guess) The bonus is a double-edged sword - on paper it sounds really good but can vary wildly from year to year. It's based more on the overall performance of the company rather than individual merit, so you could have an awesome year but if the company does poorly your bonus will take a big hit. GM has had a couple of great years but last year wasn't so good and this year is shaping to be pretty bad, so don't expect bonuses to pay dividends for a while. This used to be offset by one-off performance awards that would occasionally be given out, but this was recently replaced by a weird game-show-like points system. Again - overall still good, just not as good as it used to be, or could be. Top Management - The C-Suite and executive leadership have an excellent outlook and are usually transparent about the goals and challenges the company is facing. They have a good read on industry trends and try to adapt as quickly as a giant multi-national company can. Work-Life Balance - GM doesn't have a sink-or-swim culture, which is excellent for folks fresh out of college. You'll get a lot of support, training, and (usually) reasonable expectations in your first year. If you manage your time well and play your cards right (see Cons section for how this can fall apart) you'll never work more than 40ish hours a week. Other - GM has every ELA under the sun, so any tool you need to do your job you'll (eventually) get. Most associate-level employees are helpful and easy to get along with. There's a handful of cynical old cranks and smug millenial/GenX dudebro types but it's not too hard to find a niche.",3.0,"""Great Place to Start An IT Career"""

The CIO failed to grasp this very basic concept. He also tried this approach at HP and was ousted. Erroneously, it appears that he believed that change would result in increased innovation and lower operational costs, whereas reality demonstrated the results were one team that picked up the slack for the other, so it was an exercise in budget manipulation at a much higher overall cost to GM. In contrast to any formally documented HR policy, the CIO has explicitly stated that IT is being expected to work a minimum of 50 hours per week, and there is a clear objective of slashing headcount over the next 1.5 years.

Now that auto sales are declining and we are entering into a crunch cycle, HR and management is trying to clean house. Under performers are being put on performance improvement plans (a nice way of saying 'go away') and those who don't leave once on these plans are typically fired within 6 months. Hiring, except for college hires, has been curtailed. Unfortunately the above does not bode well. Already many teams are overworked carrying the burden of the non-workers. Now that many under performers are being sent packing, their partial workload falls on the rest of the team.

913,General Motors,"GM is a large company so don't expect to broaden your horizons. You will be corralled into a narrow set of responsibilities, and there are no real opportunities for advancement. You will perform the same repetitive tasks for the rest of your career there. Sure, you can apply internally for different opportunities, but don't expect to get the position. These new opportunities are only posted once the manager has identified the person they want to fill the role, so the interview process is a formality for the pre-selected individual and a facade for all others. Others who apply are out of luck unless the predetermined individual chooses not to accept the new role. My advice to you if you're at GM currently looking for a new role, start brown-nosing and get a manager to submit for a position for you, or look outside the environment. Don't let the ""Golden Handcuffs"" prevent you from looking outside GM for other opportunities either. They are plentiful and often pay better and provide a better overall quality of life / work life balance. No comp time or overtime afforded to those who stay up all night for their manager. The response after a 24 hour shift, some of which is from home is typically ""come in as soon as you can."" IE that next day after 3 hours of sleep. Personally witnessed three people develop heart problems after working for one manager who then required medical leave due to his management style, Described by one of them as ""a monster"". The environment is rife with favoritism and politics. Reviews are 100% corrective, and borderline abusive, so don't expect to ever know what you're doing well, even if you know there should be some positive feedback. If any positive feedback is provided at all, it is presented half handed and disrespectfully as if your efforts accounted for nothing. Per the title, if you qualify under the ADA as a person with a disability, particularly mental, expect no cooperation from your management. HR will require a doctors note for any accommodation request, and if you attempt to circumvent an HR decision about your work situation with an accommodation request from your doctor or complain about your management to the director, despite the zero retaliation policy they say they have, they will target you for termination and find a reason to let you go. They have a team of atty's that will work with HR to find a way to let you go, and block your unemployment and cobra benefits in the process. Simply google ""cobra benefits gross misconduct"" for an example. While my experience with management was terrible, there are very few managers there that are not abusive terror inducing sadists, so you might get lucky. For your health and the benefit of your family, I highly recommend looking elsewhere for employment opportunities. There is plenty of work out there, carpe diem! Senior management is either indifferent to the atrocities of the managers below them or pretends to care, then supports HR in the targeted termination effort. Work Life Balance at GM means you Live to Work. Your family takes a back seat and your children grow up without you in their lives. They will work you to death given the opportunity.","The ""Golden Handcuffs"" or benefits if you will, are bar none, the best of any employer out there. 4% donation to your 401K just for showing up every day, plus a 1:1 match up to another 4%, plus BCBS as low as $280 a month with a 3K responsibility until 10% copay to 5K out of pocket maximum is absolutely fantastic. higher level of coverage puts your out of pocket maximum at around 3K but costs more in the end, and is better to go with lower coverage level and put the difference into the HSA in case you don't spend it all. Provides the ability to carry over that money to next year. Also a $1500.00 donation to your HSA from the company if you and your spouse get a physical every year. People there are generally friendly, and the cafeterias and break rooms offer a decent variety of food options and places to sit and watch tv while you eat your lunch, of course there are others there only interested in serving their self interests, but overall, the culture is pleasant and there are lots of great people there.",2.0,"""Persons with mental disabilities beware."""

New college hires that come in after you will make more than you even though you have more experience. When interviewing they promise 40-45 hour weeks but once hired they expect 50 hour weeks or else you will be considered as someone who isn't performing well. Upper management reeks of nepotism and cronyism. They are all good friends that worked together at Dell and HP years ago and are hired based on whether they were part of this ""good boys club"" rather than based on qualifications. HR tells everyone that if you have an idea that may be contrary to the popular belief on how to accomplish a task that you should speak up and that Management will consider and in some cases adopt your idea. In reality, doing this lands you in a hole where you're labeled as a ""difficult"" individual and are treated as a pariah. They are very ""old-school"" in their management style and refuse to adopt new ideas and catch up with the times. VERY corporate America despite what they tell you before you get the job. They will assign you tasks to take up 120% of your daily time then slap you with another 50%-60% work then when you're unable to deliver it all by the end of the week (even though you're overworked and over-allocated) they will threaten to take away your raises and bonuses. Movement within the company is reserved for people who ""know a guy who knows a guy"" rather than being based off of qualifications. Constant berating of millennials.

1066,General Motors,"I joined GM after leaving a very good position in a recognized multinational aerospace company where the culture truly is similar to the Silicon Valley notion of “anything is possible.” I was extremely excited to come to GM, mostly to be a part of the new technologies and “cultural change” described by several GM spokespersons (including the CEO) in various media outlets. I was leaving a top company for what I truly believed was another top company, this is how much I believed in what GM marketed to me. I was told my technical skills and educational degrees would be challenged. It has been about six months since I joined GM and I have been given no such caliber of work. In fact, the most “complex” task I have been assigned is to submit a Work Order and create Excel spreadsheets, and yes my title is engineer. I keep asking my manager for challenging work and all I get is “paperwork” stuff that a 15 year old can do with very minimal training. I have a Bachelors and Masters in Mechanical Engineering and I do not use my education at all in GM. I also do not feel safe at work. My manager has an aggressive attitude. He constantly uses bad words and I cannot say the rest to protect my identity, but is not good. He treats his direct report as if we are his kids. I see my co-workers complaining all the time on his back, but they are afraid of speak up. All they say is “this is a good company with good pay/benefits and I am happy to have a job”. GM indeed pays well and the benefits are very good as I stated above. But I would rather make a lower salary with less benefits at a job where I can be myself and use my skill sets. GM campuses (at least in Michigan) are not tobacco free. All the building entrances smells like cigarette even the conference rooms and restrooms. Sometimes people even smoke in your face. I have even seen people in meetings talking very rude to minorities (including women’s). Is that a sign of a progressive and safe company? I do not think so. This feels more like a 8-5 job. You can tell a large number of people hate their jobs and they are there just for a paycheck. A large number of people do not respond to emails and some to phone calls. I have even been in situations when I have sent a meeting notice with days in advance and no one shows up. And when you go to their desks you seen them texting, etc. And if you ask them a question they complain and point you to someone else. Even at the company trainings you hear the instructions complaining about the company culture. One instruction even joked saying that the GM handshake is ""is not my problem - is someone else's"". GM is still a bureaucratic company where employees, mostly individual contributors, are afraid to speak up. Is true that the leadership is trying to change that culture. There are renovations in the Warren Technical Center and constant emails to promote a cultural change through collaboration. But I guess they have to get rid of a lot of people in order to change the company culture. I am very disappointed at GM.","GM pays very well. Make sure you negotiate your offer prior accepting!
