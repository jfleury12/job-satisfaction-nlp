Good benefits, potential for annual bonuses and raises based on merit, 401k matching, pension contributions, great opportunities if you want to relocate every couple of years","Overarching theme: not a lot of bang for your buck, new college grads prioritized over those with more experience, education, and military vets. Bonuses/raises: although you get them annually, they're usually in the realm of 1.5 to 3% for salaried employees, which doesn't really offset inflation. These are merit-based which depends a little bit on your performance and a lot on how Pepsi as a whole performs. Since goals vary from site to site, if you're at a high-performing site but Pepsi has a bad year (which it has been), then you could potentially work your butt off all year but not get a meaningful raise or bonus. Job opportunities: I am an 8+ year Army Vet with multiple desirable grad degrees (MBA-Supply Chain, MS-Corporate Finance, etc) and was hired on as a front-line supervisor in supply chain. After 18 months, you can apply for jobs up to 2 levels above your current role (Pepsi has levels, much like federal GS jobs). This was initially attractive to me and I though I could move up to where I should be rather quickly. However, although I am qualified to apply for management and higher jobs, they haven't interviewed me for any I have applied for. On the other hand, there are numerous campus hires who have only been with the company for 2 years or less that have already been promoted and they were initially hired in at a higher grade than myself. Let's face it, a 22 year old fresh out of college has no idea what they're doing compared to a 30+ year old vet with more education and more time with the company. The company is more focused on new college grads to promote within the company it seems. Mobility: On the supply chain side, there doesn't seem to be a lot of upward mobility. We just underwent a restructure and some executive positions were actually eliminated. This would suggest that you (a) wait it out until a higher position in supply chain opens or (b) you switch over to a different function (sales, safety, HR, maintenance, etc.) and try to work your way up that way. I'm not sure how one could bounce back and forth between functions and work their way up the pay scales without having the requisite degrees/experience to work in those fields, however. Work/life balance: You're only guaranteed Thanksgiving day, Christmas day, New Year's day, and 4th of July every year (could be more or less, depending on your market). You will otherwise be working 50+ hours a week even during holiday weeks, if not more. Even those few days you get off, you'll still be working to make sure nothing fails.",PepsiCo

Although they pride themselves on diversity and inclusivity, most of the people in management are either male or white. This is my experience in the south region. Pepsi's approach to promoting people is that you have to take a specific role after another role, and they don't really allow you to move around to different positions.

They will tell you if you perform better next year that you will get a much bigger raise. Next year you will be told that even though your results are very good, the company won't approve anything over a 2% raise. If you are getting too close to your annual targets, they will raise the targets so you can't hit them, or change your territory. Then they can tell you at the end of the year how much you suck. There is no such thing as the 40-hour work week. You are at minimum expected to work 10 to 12 hours a day. The compensation isn't great as it is for a 40-hour week, let alone a 50-60 or even 70-hour week. At any given time, there are 20 to 30 top priorities. If you're missing on any of these, you will be questioned daily. Are they aware that soda overall has been on the decline for years? Most of these priorities are ridiculous and unattainable. Pepsi doesn't want to keep employees. They would rather work them to tears before they have a family, and go somewhere else once they have one. Having a life outside of Pepsi is a huge burden for them and their bottom line.",PepsiCo

The workload is that of 1 1/2-2 people easily--across the board in essentially every department. Everyone you talk to is incredibly busy, stressed-out, and tired. Headquarters is more interested in decreasing costs to increase share value than they are about the front line employee. They used to have annual employee parties to thank the employees, now the managers get in trouble for taking their teams out to lunch once a year. The poor customers are stuck in the middle--their front line rep can't give them the attention they would like because their territories are too large. The customers used to see the same delivery driver, but that changed as well. Customer service as a whole has gone out the window. There are few gems in each department, but you can see it on their faces that they are getting close to the breaking point where they just physically can't care as much anymore.

You're not allowed to leave even if it takes 12 hours to finish the job, so you usually end up working 10-12 hours a day. The receivers along with their managers at Walmart treat your like garbage and micromanage you 24/7, despite the fact that you do not work for them directly. Frito Supervisors do not have your back when a conflict arises with unstable Walmart workers, since you're the little man and Walmart is their customer with worth of billions. The job starts at 4am. They choose your weekends. You basically come home, sleep and go back to stocking chips at 4am. Don't think that you'll manage running a side business whatsoever, you get exhausted by the end of the day. Medical and dental benefits are fine. The salary if good enough, but for such an exhausting, non-stop job, i think $20 an hour would have been better. No advancement opportunities.

The factory goes on 24/7, so it is up to the individual manager to define when they end their work day. You will work overtime, weekends, and holidays; not only as a new employee in the company, but even more so as a senior-level employee. Most of the time, there is no work from home option. Sometimes, you are on call. As a salaried employee, the compensation may not be enough for the amount of work asked of you.

They'll literally charged me over full retail because 6 cases where stolen off my truck. The doors didn't have locks, so there wasn't much I could do.

It is a ton of physical labor. To be able to progress in your career path you have to move with every new position. Management made me feel like I was a nuisance,PepsiCo

The pay is awesome.,Human Resources is the worst department at the plant I worked at. They have no clue as to what goes on in a warehouse. The profanity that is used on a daily basis. The men in the warehouse have no respect for women. When you're confronted by the men so many times after reporting to the managers and supervisors you have to take matters into your own hands. I was 6 months pregnant doing a lead position that I wasn't getting paid for and was approached by a man who said he would knock me out. No manager or supervisor on the floor just me and the men. I defended myself the best way I could and was reported like I initiated the argument. I was suspended then fired and told I was no rehirable because of the language I used. Appealed my termination thru the plant and higher Human Resources and didn't hear from the higher power. Do I think it was fair no I do not. I dedicated myself to a company who didn't even swing a bat for me when I really needed them to and they knew I had reported many complaints about being disrespected.,PepsiCo

Company treats people as if they are replaceable parts despite claiming in its values this is not the case. I have worked for many places and this is the worst of the worst in terms of safety and human resources. The company harms people through its negligence and then blames that harm on the people who have been injured. HQ messages are corrupted by the field, and staff does not provide support if it doesn't personally benefit them. Very unethical leadership only worried about avoiding lawsuits, not doing the right thing. College hire program ensures no fresh ideas or innovation, and no challenges to the corrupt culture. Inbred. Zero work-life balance.",PepsiCo

Every sells representative prefers their store to be certain way so good luck trying to please. You will usually get blamed for someone else's mistake. Coworkers judge even though it should reflect on management. Some of the routes make no sense.

They have a on site doctor to help you with anything to ha ring pain or being sick for free. You just pay for meds. Pay is good. Hours can be good if your looking for over time. Sundays are easy no delivery so if you go in early which you can if you want. Then maybe your home to see football by 1pm,Store back rooms can be a very big hassle to deal with. To move your pallets around or to even get your pallets out of back room. Organizing the back room is rough as well while still trying to fill the main shelfs and all the coolers. And Pepsi has a gang of coolers. Hard on your back!!! Hot back rooms. And you have to deal with store mangers that are picky how they want there stores. Long HR during summer and holidays. Some shifts don't get Saturday or Sunday off. Start time is 5am so if your not into early morning good luck. And that could turn into a 12hr day depending on how many pallets,PepsiCo

If you're looking to start your career and then move on as fast as humanely possible to better things - this is the company to start at. Work at this insufferable place for one year and you can go anywhere.,"Too many cons to name, but here are few: Work / life balance is horrific. Unorganized and inconsistent at every turn (literally every single team operates from its own set of rules). Push their values and moral code on you every single day, even when you try to politely opt out of events /teams. Every business decision is based solely on monetary value, not on quality of work or value of service provided (do a quick Google search for their IT/infrastructure vendor - this is a decision they will be paying for in monetary and unmonetary ways for the next 5 years of the contract). Majority of their products are genuinely terrible for you as a consumer and Pepsi genuinely doesn't care (see prior con as to why; hint $). 4-1 ratio of Chiefs to Indians. You will have literally 3 to 4 managers & directors to report to on every team, with 3 to 4 sets of rules for each one. This does not even include project managers that you give status updates to. Most employees are contractors who have been hired on full time over the years, so get ready to deal with ALOT of middle aged moms who do not have a single college credit hour to their name, let alone a college degree and who miss work constantly. Management regularly referred to certain staff as being from the ""island of misfit toys"". Terrible, yes - Incorrect, no. As mentioned in the title, soul crushing atmosphere and culture. This is the movie, ""Office Space"" come to life. You will wake up every day miserable and be around miserable people. Again, this is just a small few of the cons but you get the point. I gave Pepsico a 1star rating simply because GlassDoor does not allow you to give zero stars.",PepsiCo
