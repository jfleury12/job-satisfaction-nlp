The OLP presents excellent functional challenges. Early career leaders are stretched in manufacturing, quality, and supply chain challenges that have direct, significant impact to the businesses. The OLP Associates have full exposure to the business in their roles and through networking and mentoring. You will not find better access to executives throughout the company. The exposure to solving tough problems, strategic leadership guidance, and the future direction of the company is also key to the program’s attractiveness. The responsibility and position of the OLPs leads to enormous leadership growth over the two years. OLPs regularly evaluate their skills and the program strategic places OLPs to stretch their skill gaps. OLPs have to work hard to grow in those areas but leave the role much stronger. OLPs have the support of the program and business to facilitate the moves between businesses, as well. Roles are screened for impact to the business and the business supports the OLPs logistic and financial needs with a comprehensive moving package. The OLPs have numerous opportunities to network in and outside their teams and businesses. The name of the program itself opens doors to supportive executives that give mentoring, both formally through assigned executive mentors, and informally, as OLPs reach out to mentors per their career interests and development needs. At the end of the two years, OLPs are not short on job opportunities. The program is a two year interview with countless opportunities to present to executives and hiring managers. Taking full advantage of the company’s leadership development review boards, the program puts OLPs at the forefront of key hiring needs. OLPs go on to direct their interests and often have multiple opportunities to choose from. The program is overall a great environment to grow operations talent. The OLPs themselves develop a wide support network within their cohort of fellow associates as well as the larger employee network. The program recognizes the challenges OLPs take on, even more than the company’s already strong reward for performance culture. The overall benefits of the program are incalculable. As a former OLP, just recently graduated in 2017 I have no regrets to the challenges and adventures that the program offered me. I would not have been able to springboard my career with the amazing experiences, supportive network, and leadership insights it provided.","The program stretches across all businesses and dozens of sites within the company, each with their own local culture. Some roles, despite the screening, do not fully give the OLPs support initially. Still, a strong OLP finds there’s always work to be done and quickly motivates the site to support them by loading them up with added responsibility by exceeding expectations of performance over and over.",United Technologies

With this company I look around at jobs that I would potentially want. What I see are a bunch of managers who work 60-80hr weeks, weekends, etc, they tell everyone below that we MUST meet these numbers and that saturday and sunday are game for work. They force salary employees to take a 2.5% pay reduction and expect that the vacation day after the furlough be worked as we must meet the numbers. They micromanage down to the suppliers, they fly people to hand carry parts as part shortages are rampant. They pay massive expedite fees and ensure that they hit their numbers at no cost. If you need to come in at 6 or 8PM or stay till then, well...we need to hit the numbers. So I look up at these people, these people who run these companies like this, who instill hatred into the workers who once loved their jobs and think to myself, I don't want a single one of these positions, and to think even deeper about it, that UTC drives this culture as these individuals have been promoted to these positions. So they drive numbers, they drive it at the cost of moral, of culture and work life balance. They make you feel insignificant and replaceable, and I am sure everyone is. They even make you one of the gears (people) in their COG. This company doesn't pay all that well, no wonder turn over is high. People celebrate when others get jobs at other companies, somewhat of a weird culture. Another very weird culture is what is being flown down from management. They put a lot of groups in impossible situations. One instance is utilization, and financial targets. With long cycle times they push to meet financial goals so you focus resource efforts to hit those targets, once the month is done you are left with a gap in production because the resources were focused on moving product out the door, they turn around and ask why there is a gap and why utilization is effected Probably because you told us to work 12 hours days sat/sun to move product out the door, how can you not understand the rammifications of doing so, you are sacrificing level loaded production through long assemblies for production numbers, I cannot hit all goals when you tell me goals that directly conflict, catch 22. I cannot simultaneously train and have high utilization at the same time. Progress comes from training and investment, yet you look at numbers and charts and you expect change just because we are tracking them. Large changes come from training and investments, small incremental changes do come from process improvements, but when you hamstring us with part shortages, you screw all your measurements, and the worst of all is our group has no control over it. So being put in these situations is very frustrating for the group and leads to low morale.

However, there is zero emphasis placed on strategic thinking, emotional intelligence or well-rounded leadership skills for that matter. If you are anything below an executive, your voice won't be heard and your perspectives won't matter. So the very intelligent people hired are not fully leveraged for their expertise. There is a very strong hierarchy so sycophantic behavior is the norm. Additionally, you will not have appropriate resources, the organization is far too lean to have long term success with generation y. A very bad experience for me and if you are thinking of going here as an external hire I would caution you to think long and hard as external hires are treated like aliens.

UTC competes with the like of GE, Honeywell, Ingersoll Rand, etc. Out of the group UTC has diversified very effectively yet at the sametime maintained synergy between it's 7 units. As a result, UTC has had very few job lay-offs in the last 10 years. Not to mention high return on investment for the shareholders. UTC has also been very effective in using low cost outsourcing companies. This has not only lowered product development cost but also mitigates the risk of mass lay-offs. UTC has one of the best continuing education program imaginable. Company pays full tuition and books regardless of the type of degree you are pursuing as long as its at an accredited college or university. For example, an engineer can get a law degree with no questions asked by your immediate manager, director, HR, or any one. No contracts, no stipulations, no catch whatsover. Once you receive your degree the company also gives a $10k stock award vested right away!!! Once again, no contracts, no stipulations, no catch attached to the stock award.","Very low salary and benefits. Most UTC units (Otis, Pratt & Whitney, Sikorsky, Career, UTC Power) are based out of Connecticut, which has very cost of living. Pay and salaries on the other hand are below average across the board. UTC abolished performance based bonus several years ago. During three year period between 2000-2002, Pratt and Whitney unit did not give out raises, citing difficult economic conditions. Later on the company report record profits for years 2001 and 2002, making it's CEO George David the highest paid CEO in the nation in 2002 and 2003 at $60 million and $80 million respectively. Company didn't make up for it to the employees in the following years either as was evident by a mere 3% raise in 2003 and 2004 and 3.5% thereafter. UTC does provides 401k matching at a rate of 3.6% on the first 6% only. This is on the extreme lower end of the spectrum. Furthermore, UTC does not have a Employee Stock Purchase program either. Finally, increase in out of pocket cost of healthcare (premiums plus deductables) has out-paced cost of living increase by a factor of 2. Performance raises on the other hand have never topped 3.5%. Most UTC business units are mired with bureaucracy at all levels. This results in monumental levels of inefficiency which in turn rears its ugly head in the form of low job satisfaction and high level of personal and professional frustrations. Other businesses in the area who are often in the position to recruit UTC employees are extremely aware of UTC's bureaucratic work culture and are cautious in hiring ex-UTC employees. Annual survey conducted internally by UTC have consistently revealed low job satisfaction level compared to industry and nationwide averages. UTC also scores poorly in the area of pay and benefits.",United Technologies

There are so much to learn from all engineers since everyone has different styles of implementing and designing a specific feature; but once everyone agrees on the design, the feature is absolutely efficient that is sustainable, maintainable, and upgradable. Plenty of work to be done, where engineers are working multiple projects at once. Company is pursuing more advanced tools towards verification for automation.","The system team seems to be lacking the design of the entire product and expects the engineering department to identify all expectations of the unit. The unit has been designed and re-designed so many times, but yet the company has not been able to isolate the basic functionality as requirements and design implementation; so there are multiple implementations of the same functionality which leads to unnecessary work. Upper management doesn't seem to recognize the engineers who work hard and long hours to meet deadlines. They like to move the schedule more to the left without allowing the engineers to test features more thoroughly. Program Managers like to include new features that has not been consulted with the engineers and expect the features to be included in a release that has already been established. They also do not inform the engineers about customer's expectations/need to know information until last minute. Expect to work long periods of time as an engineer due to tight scheduling and no time for testing. Also make sure you implement the design correctly the first time, else it's always the engineers fault....

You will work with some of the most intelligent professionals around in nearly every job function and level.,"Nepotism is the norm in recognition and advancement so if you are not related to, or life long friends with an executive ""in the loop"" promotional opportunities will be limited.

They are more right than wrong as far as the direction they're taking Carrier (can't say much about the other units).","- Comp below average starting out and salary freeze (which has only thawed very little) has made that worse. - Very unsatisfied with managers of my particular division (small division, won't name here). At least for my division, management has an extreme defensive ""silo"" mentality. Many times they have made decisions or ""planned"" with assumptions completely detached from how work is actually done. Management is either completely hands off, with no direction or accountability to workers, or micromanages and gives the end employee zero freedom. Either way is ultimately unsatisfying. - Division's management has a very 1950's mentality about workers, we're here to punch a clock and not ask questions. Well, after a few years here I could go on and on. I'll just say it's not me, morale is extremely low and most everybody is skeptical of our immediate management. It is hard to have motivation to improve processes when there is no reward for doing so and management will often shout down your recommendation anyway.

The standard tools were intended to make us more efficient, give us a place to go to understand and simplify what needs to be done and make sure that from one business unit to another we are working in the same manner.
