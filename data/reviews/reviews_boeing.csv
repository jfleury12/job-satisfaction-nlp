Management is disgusting and incompetent. In my experince the individuals they hire to be managers are the worst on the floor, the laziest people who have a bad combination of an aggressive temper and lack of indepth understanding of the area they management. Managers are also moved around to much, in 4 years I have had 14 managers and have worked in 2 areas total. Safety and quality is written all over the walls like propaganda posters, but in the end of the day it's getting your job finished, without the tools you need, without the parts it requires, without the training you deserve, in time frame that is impossible.

The pay is really no significant amount more than you would get paid if you stayed in your home state. Promotions are very slow here. Seattle is very expensive (unless you live in an area no one would really want to live) so you will not be able to save a significant amount of money and eventually buy a house or save for significant life goals. The 401k is definitely well above the average. You will meet friends that work at Amazon/Microsoft making in some cases double you're making and it will make you want to get out of the Seattle area or transfer jobs. I just feel that many people really want to work for this company, but don't ever realize its not that special compared to other companies. If your goals are what I mentioned earlier I would stay away, but if you truly love airplanes, and don't mind the delay of savings then there is plenty of opportunity within the company.

Overtime pay for some salaried employees. Base pay is good, but not always the most competitive, but the bonus can be quite significant some years Huge company offers the ability to switch between projects frequently (some political savviness is required though), which can be a huge learning opportunity and resume builder as result of the breadth of technologies, products, projects, domains that are at Boeing, aside from the educational benefits available here. Honestly, a great first place for a software engineer to get a lot on your resume in a short amount of time. And a big name.","Many incompetent managers and project managers from a technical standpoint. No experience in leading a modern, agile software development project Many peers can be incompetent as well since the interview process is not technical in any way. Some employees literally do nothing and rarely come to work with little repercussions. If you do work and perform, management will hold you accountable, even though the scammer next to you may be making significantly more money. Promotions are nearly impossible at Boeing unless you are a manager. If you want meaningful salary growth or better work, you will need to self-promote by applying for jobs internally. Managers will dangle a carrot to have you stay on their team, but they literally have no power to even promote top performers. Customers/product owners are typically airplane engineers that are very opinionated about solutions. And many projects are not very product focused (i.e. no UI/UX, Product managers, etc.) and there is very little buffer between software engineers and the business. Technology stacks can vary wildly from project to project. Some can be VBA and Perl maintenance; Others can be React, Java Spring microservices, greenfield projects. There are many thousands of applications within the enterprise. Some projects are more dysfunctional/stressful than others. Business processes are so unnecessarily complex…and there seems to be a resistance from some employees to even talk about what their job is or how they do it. I am guessing this many be a result from many employees seemingly with very little responsibility (talk in a few meeting and maintain some spreadsheets they move around in a secretive fashion in a convoluted business process), but make a lot of money and wish to ride the gravy train until they retire. So there are many older employees that have been at Boeing forever, but young people with a desire to improve things will wash out quickly. I have worked in the Seattle area and South Carolina, specifically during the elimination of a lot of jobs in the Northwest. This seemed to create a lot of toxic and bitter employees which made collaboration between the 2 sites challenging. Always seems to be a looming threat of layoffs Some positive steps were taken to have a healthy agile software development lifecycle and work intake process…and being more product focused vs the traditional IT organization that the business seemed to loathe and enjoyed being quarrelsome with; however, there seemed to be an obsession with the way Pivotal Labs developed software. I agreed with most of the processes, like user interviews, TDD, etc., but after a year of doing 100% pair programming on my last 2 projects at the Company, I had to leave. Pair programming can be a powerful tool, but seemed to have very negative effects on the team and their happiness. The lack of schedule flexibility (forced to commute in Seattle at 8am and 5pm) degraded my quality of life. Also, sitting and talking next to someone for 8 hours a day, everyday can be so exhausting. No space to think about a problem critically and offer differing solutions to the loudest voice in the room. It was always “do the simplest thing"" and code it now, which inevitably let to horrible design and maintenance issues.",Boeing

I applied for a Design Engineer position, and had an interview over the phone. It was 5 STAR questions, and we didn't talk about my resume or engineering at all. I asked what the position exactly was, they couldn't tell me. Said they would follow up in 2-3 weeks - all of a sudden, 6 weeks later, they offer me a job. Now, don't get me wrong, I didn't think I would be taking a gamble on accepting an offer at Boeing. I figured, at worst, I would be a design engineer on a boring commodity, but I would at least be doing ""engineering"" in the literal sense. Move out to WA only to find out that I am indeed NOT an engineer, but a project manager. Realistically, I would have quit then and there because I have absolutely no interest in that statement of work, but that's out of the question because you have to pay back all relocation assistance if you leave before a year. This is my biggest gripe - they never told me what the job was, I never got to talk with my manager until after I accepted, and was never explicitly told what I would be doing until my first day. I spent a long time interviewing and looking for jobs because I wanted to start somewhere I would want to stay. Every other interview has been extremely transparent and ALWAYS consisted of more than one interview (and in person ones at that). After speaking around, I found out that my resume was pretty much randomly pulled and because it was in the right place at the right time and given to a team that requested some heads. It boggles my mind that such a terrible hiring process is in place. I am grossly under qualified for project management, and despise it - so guess what, I despise coming to work every day. But you know what I signed the paper work for? The job description, the title ""design engineer"", and the brand name of Boeing. So there is someone out there, who would actually like or more importantly be good on the job I am doing right now, but because they spend such bare minimum energy on the hiring process, they get a mixed basket of people who come into work on their first day full of surprises. -Most of the software that is used here is archaic, broken, and a waste of time. Very simple tasks can end up taking insurmountable time. -Work culture promotes ""bare minimum"" attitude (i.e. 40 hours and not a second more) -No one works the same schedule and no one tells anyone when they are going on vacation (when I say no one, I mean a good number of people, as I am overexaggerating) -Office has no natural light and looks ugly, making it hard to spend all day there -Half of my day is spent in meetings where nothing is accomplished besides people talking about things not related to the job -Receive no feedback on my job performance.

Management don't know what it means to develop software, so most projects end up crashing and burning miserably. Your manager is going to have some random degree and experience that has nothing to do with software, and their sole purpose for existing is to do politicking to navigate the bureaucratic mess that is Boeing. Tech fellows provide zero leadership as they are just as clueless about software development as management is. You will hear comments from them such as ""Is C++ a managed language?"", and no one can tell you why this is simply horrifying to hear from a high-level software engineer when your target language is.... c++. This is a side-effect of an interview process that is 100% behavioral and 0% technical. The type of interviews that politicians and psychopaths excel at. Every project has the stench of bad, bad, code smells. Multi-million dollar a year projects with 20-30 software engineers contributing with absolutely no standardized workflow. People literally just force push to master at will. No code review, no testing, copy-paste code, no CI, no lint or style guide, and huge amounts of resources spent reinventing (poorly) the wheel instead of using COTS software. If that doesn't make you recoil in horror read on. Very, very limited job growth opportunities. Ask any team and you'll find that there are level 1 engineers that have been working there for 4-5 years. If this is by design so that it encourages job hopping within Boeing so you get a more varied experience in your career, great! But wait, there's a high chance that even if you find an opportunity elsewhere, you won't be offered relocation. That 10k+ to move across country to get a miniscule raise is coming out of your pocket. This means there's no incentive to actually stay within the Boeing system. Your current wage is actually used as a negotiating strategy against yourself when finding a new job of interest. Management will often tout ""But the benefits are great!"" This is absolutely not the case. Health care insurance is strictly worse at Boeing than the two other companies I've worked at since. 3.6k deductible and a 7k out-of-pocket max with monthly premiums that are exactly the same as the traditional plans I got at the other companies. Pay is woefully under market value for a software engineer. If you're a mechanical, industrial engineer, I'm sure it's fine. But it simply doesn't match the lucrative market for software engineering, as Boeing lumps all engineers into one bucket. If you're stuck in the Charleston area, then I'm not sure there's a lot of better choices. If you're a young software engineer reading this fresh out of school thinking this is your opportunity to put a fortune 500 company on their resume, save yourself from wasting your time with what will be the inevitable. Do not come to Boeing South Carolina. The young software engineers that Boeing captures through its university outreach program leave in droves for a reason. I suggest embedding yourself in a tech city with multiple alternative opportunities if your first choice doesn't work out. If you think I'm exaggerating about any of this, due your own due diligence and please try the simple test of asking your interviewers brain dead CS questions like ""what is a compiler?"".",Boeing

345,"""Do Not Recommend""",2.0,Size of company provides plenty of opportunities to try new positions and locations.,"Very bureaucratic and top heavy. While there are great leaders within the company, many today have achieved their position based on political savvy rather than leadership ability. With that in mind the review process for any decision is very slow and time consuming as every layer of management (and there are many) wants an opportunity to review each and every recommendation and/or briefing package. By the time a recommendation/package has been thoroughly reviewed, it is so sanitized that it no longer contains anything useful. I highly recommend you take the time to read through all the reviews and note the number of reviews that look favorable, yet include comments like slow, bureaucratic, poor leadership, stifling, bad management, heavy oversight, etc. It is also worth noting the number of good reviews that don't necessarily recommend the company. This is a company where things have become so process driven that it favors those who prefer a career centered in the status quo, so it is not uncommon to find employees who have worked there for 30, 35, 40+ years. At the same time you do have young leaders who have risen quickly, however many lack basic leadership ability and are most interested in holding information close-to-the-vest to ensure their continued advancement at the expense of members of their own team. As such they are also not interested in taking on tough challenges or identifying areas of concern. When you look at the issues that plague most 100+ year-old companies, you can find all of those at Boeing. Where it was once a company that valued innovation, today true innovation is generally viewed as too risky. When that is combined with an environment that strongly discourages people from bringing forth concerns/issues, you end up with a very stressful environment that feels very reactionary rather than proactive. With so many job opportunities available in the marketplace, I just can't in good faith recommend Boeing to anyone.",Boeing

Low annual salary increases unless again employee is one of the chosen ones. Male and or younger employees assigned higher profile projects. Top leadership is all talk - they say employees are valued with their annoying “thank you for all you do.” Yes thank us for lining your pockets $$$$$$$ while many non-management employees need to take second jobs just to survive.,Boeing

You basically have to threaten to quit and show them you have other higher paying options for them to even consider a raise and promotion. It's guaranteed HR and management will throw the ""market"" or ""business case"" argument at you because their hands are tied to corporate processes.

I have learned a ton about business, managing a supply chain, as well as information about production, the list goes on. The benefits are ok, certainly better than a lot of places, but not as great as others. There are a lot of different jobs, so for people who choose to stay with the company, there is an opportunity for them to move around if they actively pursue opportunities. The company makes a cool product and it is amazing to get to see it They have cafeterias on site, but I think many large companies have this, probably even smaller ones now. There are a lot of groups and employee organizations The company does a decent job of communicating with employees Ultimately I would not recommend this job. While there are some pros, I do not think they outweigh the tremendous cons that my coworkers and I experience.","These obviously will not apply to everyone so keep that in mind. Some of these also have counter points in the Pros section The parking situation is a disaster and the company doesn't seem to care enough to provide real transit alternatives for employees. They talk about flexibility but there really isn't much if you have to start by 7:30 just to get a parking spot, and even at 7:30, depending on where work, you might need to allocate close to an hour just walking to and from your car. You will literally see cars driving around the parking lot waiting for people to leave during the day. That is not a reasonable use of time. If you get there early it is fine but there are some challenges to getting to work by 6:30 / 6:45 for some people. The benefits have significantly decreased, a little every year but this is happening at a lot of companies Supply Chain Management, in my opinion, is not treated very well and it makes the job not very enjoyable at times. There is so much work to do. No way are you just putting in just 40 hours and getting what you have to do done. This is hands down one of the most stressful jobs I have ever had. There are so many meetings, and things done just to chase metrics. Because there are so many meetings there isn't time to do the work that needs to be done. The pay is ok, not great for what is asked. We are salaried, which isn't inherently bad, but keep that in mind for context I suppose. Everything is complicated to get done. It seems like there is never a simple fix to anything. You have to talk to several people and it might take days to get access to anything or mitigate problems that need to be fixed. In some ways it makes sense but in other ways it makes it hard to do your job.",Boeing

Somewhat typical big company approaches to everything. Individual positions good or bad or in between, totally dependent on managers and colleagues so generalization probably impossible. Overall OK place to work, but not outstanding.","Salary seems soft, with very limited to no negotiation room in initial hiring. Past that, the usual steps.

544,"""Millennial Catering is the Norm""",3.0,"Over the years, Boeing, like most companies, has started to cater to the millennial over the seasoned employee. It's as if the company is betting their entire future on what these new employees may be able to provide vs. what the current employees do provide. If you're in your 40's, or above, your future is pretty much set in stone. Reaching a technical level 4 is probably it. Level 5's and above, as well as older level 4's, are always at risk of being tossed out due to the salary they're being paid. The company is trying to migrate to an average technical level somewhere between 3 and 4. Once you move from reviews that 'exceed expectations' to ones that simply say 'met expectations', you know your time is limited. If you are willing to move into management your future is wide open. Staying in a technical track will never keep pace w/ the management track when it comes to salary and bonuses. Bonuses on the management side are nearly double that of the technical side. Side note, if you are female and/or a member of some sort of defined minority class then more possibilities exist now and into the future. Problem the company has now IMO is people who probably shouldn't even work there are taking the management track and it's starting to show in the decisions being made. Managers are rarely if ever put on the street for poor decisions, but, simply moved to other areas 'more fitting'. Recent contract wins for military items have increased the number of technical opportunities present, but, you will work long hours with little to no overtime pay under a schedule that is not achievable. Your bonus will not make up for these long hours. Accolades will go to the management and exec levels at the expense of the technical levels. You will have to dial back your expectations of reality as well. Think you can get a project done in a year? No, better plan on three. And, it will be way over budget. All of these things will be out of your control. For the most part your work will be judged on how well it looks in PowerPoint opposed to what actual contribution it has to the performance of the product or the bottom line. I've seen a number of technically bad ideas actually make it into a product. Some of the most basic of engineering concepts are lost on a number of both new, and, seasoned employees. Questioning these ideas will only bring shame upon yourself unless you're willing to really stand up to them and call them out for the junk science they are. Most are not willing to do this and simply keep quiet, or, leave the company. Work output expectations from new hires is typically low. In fact most expectations are low when it comes to new hires. Show up when you want, leave when you want, Don't want to work on something? That's OK, here's something more interesting. I'll have the seasoned engineers do your real work for you. An 80% solution to a problem is OK because the company will just propose to fix the other 20% in the next contract proposal. Then do only 80% of that requirement. On and on and on....Now you know why a hammer costs the government a million dollars. Why fix a problem when there is more money to be made in prolonging the problem. 2019 will be the first year where the company has a tiered plan when it comes to medical cost deductions. The less pay you make, the less you pay in medical premiums. Some will pay nothing this year. They say the executive level will pay the most but I seriously doubt that as there are typically employment contracts which dictate nearly all exec perks. For a number of years we had a no-cost HSA but the deductibles kept creeping up. This year we still have the high deductibles, but, there are monthly deductions now. If you want to have children, 2019 and beyond is the year to do so. Three months of paid time off along w/ 12 weeks of FMLA as well as short and long term disability pay if you want to go that route.

The only way you get promoted is if you spend practically your whole life at the company. Company culture is very old and not attractive to younger people. They have managers that don't encourage you to explore other areas of the company and deny you the opportunity when you ask about it. They have poor placement and development programs. They put people in departments that aren't even relevant to their degree of study, and you don't learn anything new. A lot of the people that have stayed in the company longer are complacent and play games on Facebook during work hours. There's a reason why they're called the ""Lazy B"" in the aerospace industry. They are not considerate to tell people that most interns are located in Everett or Renton. Their end of the summer report out event was not helpful at all.

I like working for Boeing because of the quality of life upgrade from a previous job. Offices are equipped with ergonomic chairs and desks making long hours easy. Facilities can range from brand new to semi old but overall provide a good work environment. Great company to hire into and just mindlessly collect a paycheck doing what your job requires. Safe and stable (unless you are on the Commercial side). There are modest bonuses that anyone with half a brain and a decent work ethic can achieve.,You are just another cog in a giant machine.

Do not expect raises or bonuses comparable to how much effort you have put into your work. Especially if you are working on a program that is not doing well, you will get lumped into a bell curve that determines your performance. They completely lack the amenities of a decent company such as supplying tissues, office supplies, and water. If you would like filtered water pool you money together with coworkers and pay for it yourselves. As a woman working at this Good ol Boys Club was very frustrating. If you dress nicely (pencil skirts) you will be listened to in meetings, if you choose a pant suit you will be asked to take notes.

Lifeless work, you don't have to use your brain. All of your coworkers are extremely unqualified and not very smart. Extremely racist hiring practices. They value ""diversity"", over technical ability, so they hire based on skin color and foreign origins above all other factors. They do not ask technical questions. 100% behavior STAR questions, so they are asking questions like ""tell us about a time you had a problem at work"" for 6 figure positions. Like I said above, they don't value technical abilities or degrees, so you often see mechanical and electrical engineers hired to perform as software engineers. Mechanical/electrical engineering is embedded in the culture (obviously), so they still prefer these degrees for ALL roles in the company (lol). Promotion is not based on merit, but blindly applying to as many levels above you as you can. The hiring manager for the position you are applying for has 0 insight of your past job performance, and will give you an ""equal opportunity"" to get promoted as everyone else on the planet (or they may just hire their favorite). Nepotism is rampant. Did I mention racism? Just don't work here. No one is punished for not doing any work, or poor behavior. You can file as many HR complaints as you want against coworkers (sexual harassment, yelling, tantrums etc), and after HR ensures they are protecting the company from lawsuit and they are safe, they will not follow up/reprimand the employee. You will not gain any new skills here. All software is installed in these huge bubbles of firewalls and system restrictions to keep their dumb employees from downloading viruses and trojans. The hiring practices really are the root of all of these problems. Any smart/talent that leaks into this company is quickly evicted by the toxins and general aura of incompetence. Oh, and they have 6 layers of ""managers"", including level 1 managers that they hire straight out of school.

I started as a C++ embedded software developer, then transitioned to full-stack web development with modern Javascript frameworks, and now I'm transitioning over to systems engineering.","1) My organization has a very short term outlook. As in, priorities set by management change on a weekly basis. This I think is in part because Boeing as a whole expects its subsidiaries to perform well each quarter (I work at a Boeing subsidiary). 2) Raises suck. Better than inflation, but not by all that much. Promotion raises are bad as well and even after you've moved up a level, they don't increase your raises by all that much. 3) We are required to take a lot of useless training every year. It's perhaps useful the first year you take it, but not after that. 4) The career ladder grinds to a halt once you hit senior engineering level (level 4 and above, highest non-executive level is 6). Climbing the ladder while remaining technical is extremely hard to do, and requires a lot of ambition and a little bit of luck. Becoming a manager may be a bit easier, but by doing so you sacrifice your ability to do technical work.

The top talent that comes to Boeing (chasing the brand) is disillusioned and leaves within Two years. Boeing has switched from hiring talent to just hiring ""bodies"" to populate the numerous layers of management. - There is a serious problem with discrimination that is not often talked about. If you are not born in the US, or are not Caucasian, you will not be entitled to a professional opinion and a comparable work statement to your white peers - period. You will forever be considered an affirmative hire, regardless of your merits, and are expected to be happy you have a job at all. You will consistently receive lower raises than your peers despite the same performance scores, your promotion is the lowest priority compared to your peers, and you will pad the bottom of the retention pool (you will be top priority target for a layoff, unlike your white peers - there are always other minorities they could hire to check the box). - Employees who are not born in the US or are non-Caucasian are not welcome (or even treated as equals to their white peers). Among many other examples, I witnessed a highly acclaimed senior structural designer (with 25+ years of experience in the industry including well known drone projects), holder of a PhD and an MBA from the most reputable technical college in the world be given menial work unrelated to his discipline for years (the said engineer was Korean). Basically, if you are not born in the US, don't start your career at Boeing with any hopes of a merit-based advancement, or even being treated as an equal with professional decency: most people who run the place don't consider you entitled to that and you are expected to just be happy you have a job there. They probably wouldn't hire you if they had other ways of showing that they are indeed an EOE. - Internal interview processes are often manipulated by managers who would tell their preferred candidates what questions would be asked and specifically what answers the interview panel wants to hear for every interview question. Then, the same managers will sit on the interview panel to influence the panelist in their candidate's favor. I personally witnessed this, and I was told it is not against the rules, despite being fundamentally unfair. Please manage your expectations and don't start your Boeing career under the assumption that Boeing is a fair and merit-driven place to work in if you are not white. - There is so little ethical oversight, that there are bible studies during work hours led by senior managers and technical fellows. If you are lucky enough to be invited, it is most likely a sign that your career is about to advance. Otherwise, you are simply not given the opportunities, which are instead given to the bible study regulars. Early in my career, I was told by a senior manager that ""so long as you deny our savior [I am not religious at all], you won't go anywhere"". If you ever find yourself in a situation like that and you are not Christian, or simply are not religious in any way, don't take a stand. Just forget about it, you won't go anywhere.

I had 11 (1st line) managers in 3 years all giving positive reviews, followed by a layoff. Was told it's not personal, just business. There is so much indecision within the Jr. leadership ranks that decisions cannot be made or agreed upon until it is too late. This inability to come to a decision hurts production, morale, increases rework, costing the company more $$$. Management is only looking out for themselves, the inability to share resources, talent, or expertise leads to employees wanting to leave. There is a revolving door of managers at Boeing. Many managers never stay in one place for long, a few months to a year and they're gone to the next thing. This behavior makes it IMPOSSIBLE to build a relationship with your manager, get a good raise, level up, improve retention, etc. Me thinks it's a new policy to keep employees from leveling up/get decent raise. There are some really bad managers at Boeing which for some reason, Boeing will not get rid of, they just give them a new assignment/group.

1493,"""Web Browsing Utopia !!""",3.0,"The benefits were great. No comparison with any other company that I've worked for. There were some very nice people and some who were very competent as well. Work-life balance is fantastic at this company. On average, it takes between four and five people to accomplish what it would take, in a more modern company, one person to accomplish . This is a big plus if you have other priorities outside of work. E.g. running a business, writing a book, getting your masters etc. Not only did I know of people who wrote novels during work hours, but I knew of company owners who had Boeing employees come and do occasional work for them during business hours as a side business. Sweet! If you're exceptional at what you do or if you are not that good at all, it doesn't really matter. What's important is that you meet the gender, racial and age ideals of the manager who you work for. Most managers are of a certain gender, race and age, but there are few who are diverse. So choose your manager wisely and you'll be good to go. If you like thinking inside the box, they're going to love you there. If high performance is not your thing, then you're going to be a hero. This is a great place to learn different cultures and history. E.g. the work culture of your parents and the way businesses were run back in 1987 or even 1957. If you like politics, look no further. If you're the lifer type, then you've arrived!!","No real cons, unless you like to challenge the status quo, accomplish more than is expected of you, or be yourself.

We all work on old jets that are getting upgraded and are pretty much just paper pushers. I went to school for TWO engineering degrees to fill out paperwork all day?! Also, the management and executives here are awful. Can someone say bureaucratic?? Okay, so all managers here don't suck....but most do. They are micro managers, know nothing about the jobs their team members do, and are just in it for getting to the next level. This company really needs to take a better look at who they promote into management and executives. My manager once told me I needed to tell him before talking to HR about anything......oh and also I have to tell him every time I leave the building. INSANE right?!?! This place is also slower than a snail. Yes, aircraft are complex, but damn we move so slow it is a wonder how we ever made jets and sold them back in the day. It takes about a million signatures and approvals to get anything done around here. Everyone is always sad and crabby here and talks about how they wanted to leave long ago but basically got stuck in the slow and awful aerospace industry and really didn't want to leave the benefits.

It is truly the most boring job I have ever had and I really tried for so long to make the best of it and see the light that I thought everyone else here saw, and now I finally have my ticket outta here. There is so much more to write but I will leave it at this. Boeing is not this awesome and amazing place to work that so many people think it is. Especially if you are early in your career.

Boeing has a very generous tuition assistance program, I received my Masters degree for almost free from this program. Compensation and benefits are good in my opinion. Healthcare & 401k are great. Pay scales are good for some jobs, annual raises are usually 2-3%, higher if in SPEEA. The company is also doing a lot to get serious about competitors such as Airbus, start to focus on competition and efficiency. There are many open positions at any one time and there is a culture that generally promotes people being able to jump into different jobs/assignments every few years, which can keep things interesting and create great depth for employees. Work life balance is generally respected well and promoted.","Boeing is dominated by an engineering culture, engineering generally dominates decision making. Where engineering is not actual making decisions, senior leadership has a background in engineering. This inst all bad, but it leads to an unbalanced culture. Boeing is very much stuck in a seniority system. Most personnel decision making (pay, assignments, promotions, etc.) is dominated by years of service requirements. This creates a company where people either learn to ""do their time"" and lose their passion or they leave the company. Many talented young people are coming to the company, getting frustrated with this culture and leaving. Facilities/offices are generally pretty crappy and drab, and parking is a nightmare at the major sites. There seems to be an expectation in the Puget Sound that regardless of where you live you will eventually have to commute to a different site, regardless of how much this may impact your life or family. Despite this, senior management seems to be completely uninterested in investing in any kindof inter-site transportation, or even building enough parking spots for employees to reasonably get to work. I have honestly spent over an hour, multiple times trying to find a place to park when coming to Renton site or Everett site mid-day for a meeting. Its an incredible waste of time and frustrating.

Vacation, sick leave and money for education.","Research theory x management style and that is essentially the model the company has chosen to reinstitute. Some locations/shops may not be as bad but where I was at (Everett, Wa), it was horrible. Just a few things employees face; You can't stop to tie a shoe without being harassed on why you aren't working. I witnessed them following people around and harassing them almost non stop even while people worked. They move people to new planes and new areas without allowing them time to learn the job and regardless of how many people may have an issue with a particular job it's always the employees fault, never the company or how the job was created, the anomoly of the structure itself, etc. They won't help you to succeed because really if they don't like you, if you haven't kissed the right butt, if you haven't worked yourself to death, they're wanting you to fail. Even if you do think, ""well, I'm a hardworker, I can do it!"" just know when you get hurt (and you will get hurt working like that there or develop health issues) there is NO LOYALTY once you are broken, they'll be gunning to get rid of you. They clump people with disabilities together and ship them outside (on projects that don't even seem like a plane truly for sale, shutter to think the hours wasted therel!) and harass them until they quit or get fired. Anyone using FMLA is treated as though they are lazy or abusing the federal law and while some may do that, not all do. Some just want to get their health together and get back to work. Management and team leaders even promote the overall toxic atmosphere by openly speaking badly about employees and eachother so there's no real going to work, doing your job and going home. Day shift is worse for it as far as I can tell. It's challenging to get into other positions there because it's a long process before you can even apply. It use to be that you could just put in a request but now they've instituted a litany of requirements before you even qualify to put in a move request so most people get stuck and when you're new to a shop, you can't move for a year anyway. With forced overtime there is no work/life balance. Depending on where you end up, that's a real possibility. You work to live, you dont live to work. They have no values anymore. They go on and on about ethics while they take entire groups of people with varying levels of disabilities or health issues and send them outside to an area even more unsafe than where they were coming from! The company is merely an empty shell of what it once was and if they continue on this course, the pay just won't be worth the excessive health issues one is likely to develop while there, the stress it adds to your personal life..I would rather be paid less and treated with dignity.

I had 4 managers during my time at Boeing, and none were able to translate business objectives into measurable, obtainable goals for employees. This leads to chaos and confusion. This is made worse by the fact Boeing is so large, nobody knows what is going on elsewhere in the company. Entire functions and departments are replicated leading to massive amounts of waste. Management does not appear to communicate. - The culture is one of defeatism, inaction, politicism, and avoidance of work. A huge company may move slower than a smaller one, but can still move a lot faster if employees are brought on board and engaged with the change. The ""ship"" will turn a lot faster if all hands are working to move it together. - Internal communication at Boeing is horrendous. Expect correspondence with management to be ignored and forgotten for weeks or even months. Boeing lacks all sense of urgency. - Management tends to cycle through roles they don't understand for ""development"" purposes, ruining any gains that might be gained by having managers experienced in the tasks they manage. - Excessive focus on management to metrics rather than doing what is best for the company. Management will refuse to do work needing to be done simply because doing it will harm their bonus. - The company is operating in the past and has failed to invest in a modern capital infrastructure. There is no ERP system, and Boeing is the only defense firm out of the top 25 which doesn't have one yet. Management of the company is done by spreadsheet and PowerPoint. - If you don't engage in politics and are not a woman, advancing to management is unlikely. - Human Resources policies are backwards and outdated. Time in position is heavily focused on for promotions. High performance is not compensated. Conformity to HR policy results in the poorest performers becoming managers, and the highest performers leaving the company for better prospects. - Supplier Management, particularly the management of Supplier Management, is known to be extremely poor across the entire company.

A couple of key areas have changed my mind: Accountability - too many ineffective managers are constantly moved around and reassigned to new areas despite lack of performance. This is troublesome when we were told staffing reductions would be made across the board, yet we've seen no managers affected. In non-management areas, some employees spend full days doing anything but work. It's fascinating that some can sit and watch television programs on their computers during their shift, surf the internet, etc. as if having no work to do or any concern that their manager or others know this. The same few people are called on to do the actual work, then others on the team stand up to take the credit in front of leadership. Don't bother raising any of these concerns with Human Resources - they will take statements and ""investigate,"" but the behavior does not change. Opportunities - the company is undergoing multiple rounds of layoffs, which has created a toxic environment and culture where people are perpetually stressed. That said, you can be told you are doing next-level work and absorb higher-level statements of work from employees who have left Boeing, but will then be told you can't be given a level promotion for who knows how long because of the state of the company.

Name Recognition - Some future employers may be impressed by the presence of ""Boeing"" on your resume. Decent Benefits - Health, Dental, Life, 401k matching","Pay - Not competitive. At least, not in the long run. They might hook you with what seems like a decent salary, and then essentially lock you in at that pay rate with only marginal increases from year to year (averaging around 2%). The only way to get a decent raise is to get a promotion, which brings me to... Advancement - If you're looking for an opportunity for advancement, look elsewhere, especially if you're early in your career. Also, if you think promotions should be based on performance or skills, then you'll be sadly disappointed - promotions are strictly based on criteria such as number of years with the company. Sure, performance plays a small part in the promotion process, but you have to clear all the seniority hurdles first. When I left the company, they had essentially implemented a ""promotion freeze"" by raising the mandatory minimum threshold required for advancement. It didn't matter what level you were performing at - if they hired you on at Level I, you were locked in at that pay grade for a minimum number of years before they would even consider granting you a promotion, even if you were performing the work of a Level II or III engineer. Resources - If you need a faster workstation to do your job better, good luck. You're not getting a faster workstation until your current one's contract expires. It doesn't even matter if its obsolete and totally ill-suited for the tasks you perform in your daily job. Need an additional monitor to maximize your productivity? Well, tough - you're going to have to expend all of your social capital just getting one of those. Yes, its a $300 purchase that will net the company thousands of dollars in increased productivity, but the bean-counters don't care about intangibles like that. Need a VM to run some automated testing? Be prepared to wait months for permission to be granted. Need a relatively cheap software license to help you do your job? Get ready to spend weeks waiting for permission from various managers. Need a free software license to help you do your job? You'll still need to ask and wait for permission to get one of those. Innovation (or lack thereof) - Know of a better tool or process that would be orders of magnitude better than the one you're currently using? That's nice - keep it to yourself, because the monolithically-minded folks at Boeing aren't interested in letting you innovate by trying something different. You're supposed to do what everyone else does, even if its bad or inefficient. They even came up with a slogan for it - the ""One Boeing"" strategy. It was probably well-intended - drive costs down by not re-inventing the wheel on every project. But it was poorly implemented - the gigantic management pyramid somehow took that directive to mean ""squash any suggestion of doing something differently"", which conveniently fits with the natural tendency of any large organization to resist changes. It wouldn't matter if the thing you were suggesting had already been solidly proven effective by other companies - the default answer would remain ""No"". Meetings - Oh, the meetings. If you enjoy them, then you're in luck. If you're convinced that collaboration is the key to getting work done, then you'll be more than happy with attending hours upon hours of meetings each week, collaborating over what needs to be done while never actually making any progress on what needs to be done. If, however, you're someone who actually needs to spend time alone doing actual work on a project in order to come anywhere close to completing it, then you'll probably be frustrated by all the time spent talking about doing things. It took leaving the company and moving on to new opportunities for me to realize just how much time was wasted on meetings during my two years at Boeing. Note: My experiences may not be typical of Boeing in general. Boeing is, after all, a very large organization. But I can say with confidence that my experiences were very much typical for the division I was working in.

As a new and relatively younger engineering manager I am quickly getting good work experience and exposure to the broader business. New managers are thrown into the fire and there is no hand holding, which comes with pros and cons. In my experience the first lines make the majority of important operational business decisions and are solely responsible for trying to set culture and engagement within the company.","Bureaucratic, unmotivated union employee force, low market pay for managers, slow, uncoordinated, too much engineering outsourcing. Boeing suffers from an aging workforce propelled by the union which protects the senior population at the expense of the company and the younger workforce. Unfortunately this produces a number of tenured long time employees that no longer have motivation, lack engagement, and skew the compensation profiles which ultimately leads to a culture that cannot compete with modern companies. There may well be many opportunities for younger employees in the next decade but Boeing has to figure out how to keep them around in a competitive employment market while also navigating through ongoing cost initiatives (layoffs, reduction in raises/benefits, ...) that disproportionately affect the younger population. The company is too bureaucratic which directly affects the long term ability to compete. Inordinate policies around supplier manager, finance, and most everything else create an enormous support organization that costs the company and sucks the life out of everyday work for those that are actually contributing to creating airplanes. I also think Boeing struggles with coordination among it many different business units and organizations. One arm seemingly does not know what the other is doing, as though he company is too big for it's own good. Contributing to this are the number of outdated critical business tools and seemingly refusal to modernize. Having been an engineer and now an engineering manager, I can say Boeing has problems with how it values it's first level managers. The position has financial disincentive (up to 5% more pay at the expense of loss of overtime and loss of Union incentives) while being a considerably more stressful, difficult, and unrecognized position with a worsening work/life balance. Boeing's engineering managers are considerably underpaid compared to market rate relative to Boeing's engineers, as demonstrated by the fact that Boeing recognizes a level 4 engineer equivalent to an engineering manager. Most engineers do not want to be an engineering manager for good reason, and Boeing should realize this is directly affecting the type of managers they will be able to get and keep.",Boeing

The pace of work can be slow at times. There isn't a lot of mentorship and you have to be friends with management in order to get promoted.

2245,"""The Hard Truth""",1.0,There aren't a lot of pros to working for Boeing any more. Pay is just ok compared to industry and there is usually not a lot of OT required. But that's about it.,"Boeing is in bad shape as a company. Mostly this is due to their management and workforce practices, but the problems run much deeper. First the workforce issues. Like all aerospace companies Boeing has a problem with an aging workforce. But the way they handle it is incredible. Instead of trying to pair off younger and older workers to transfer knowledge and experience, or to have subject matter experts teach or give seminars to help the younger employees, their answer is to force the older workers into retirement or layoff and hire college graduates but give them no direction. And the almost religious belief of management is that all they need to do is write better processes. The result is massive amounts of critical knowledge flying out of the door while at the same time young employees are floundering. The defense side has lost so much capability that they can hardly execute on existing programs to say nothing of winning new work. In five years time, Boeing Defense Systems will likely be unable to execute even the most basic efforts. Second is the management practices. Like all large companies, Boeing prides itself on saying all the right things. Ethics, Safety, Diversity, Execution, Innovation are all words that spill from senior management mouths every time they talk. But that's all it is; talk. Boeing encourages deceptive and unethical management practices, not through its words, but through it actions. The micro management pressure brought down on lower level managers is intense. As such, they quickly learn that the way to survive is to ONLY say what the upper levels want to hear. After a while this ""selective disclosure"" becomes second nature. Those that do it best, and those that learn to deflect any bad news to some other manager, quickly get promoted. At each level the problem gets worse. By the time a manager makes Executive level they are almost physically incapable of telling the truth. Everything that comes out of a Boeing Executive's mouth has been filtered to such an extent that none of it can be believed. And the worst part is the Executives don't even seem to realize that it's happening. Or they are just so accomplished that they hide it well. As an employee at Boeing you cannot believe a single word which come out of a Manager's mouth. It's sad but true. A manager will lie to an Engineer with a straight face and zero remorse. They will tell you things that they know to be untrue, and they will throw you to the wolves to advance their career. They cannot be trusted.",Boeing

No work life balance, if you work hard they don't reward you they pile more work on you.

Company cost savings causes some issues for having efficient systems to work in. he worst part of my job is entering purchase orders in a DOS system called PCOS to order thousands of parts.

No opportunities for career advancement unless you want to work outside of your educated field managing people in janitorial. Decades behind in technology. Surprising but sadly true.

There isn't much of an onboarding process involved other than meeting your manager, being shown your desk, and getting the stack of boxes containing your computer and accessories. While there is a high-level orientation all employees go through, there's not much to speak of when you get to your work location. The experience feels disorienting to someone who isn't quite sure what is expected of him, and you get the sense that many questions you have to bug your co-workers with could have easily been answered had there been some form of organization with getting you up to speed. Previous employers have had this in place, and the transition from being green and aimless to having a clear picture of responsibilities and role was smooth and relatively painless. At Boeing, it's more of a dive into the deep end of the pool when 1) You don't really know how to swim, and 2) You're not sure how deep the water is. I'm devoting the entirety of the Con section of this review to this one topic, because I feel it's absolutely crucial to get it right, and that Boeing has to do a better job with it. I've been in my current position for over 10 months, and in many cases, I still feel clueless about some things. It's not that I haven't asked the right questions, it's that there are questions I had no idea I was supposed to ask.

Amazing 401k and they pay for your education if you want to go to grad school.,"Where to begin... 1. Layoffs. There are always layoffs and, during my time there, it seemed like everyone who was above a level 2 employee was just counting the days until they were cut. I never had a meeting or even a casual conversation with a coworker in which layoffs didn't come up as a topic. The only employees who weren't worried about layoffs were us young employees who weren't making enough money as it was. It was quickly made clear that as soon as you were making a real salary, you were going to be replaced by young, cheap labor. 2. Every piece of software used at Boeing was made in the 80s and is horribly broken. Because of the layoffs, no one is there long enough to truly learn the software and Boeing will never let the programmers replace the broken stuff. Instead, everything is patched together just long enough to keep it running until that programmer is inevitably let go. After that, it's the new, underpaid employees problem. 3. If you graduated college, you are wasting your degree here. Almost all of the work that I did was busy work. It included entering data into databases and troubleshooting horrible, patched together code. It was work that I could have done in high school. I never once utilized anything that I learned in college. I feel like my critical thinking skills probably decreased in the time I was there because they absolutely never used. 4. You will be stuck on a single project and that is where you will stay. If you are interested in working on a different product, tough luck. Whoever is on that project will never let you in because they are too terrified of looking replaceable and as soon as you look replaceable, you are gone. 5. Boeing is a massive company and you will feel it. You will work in a room of 400 other IT workers and that room will be one of 20 just like it in your building. Also, the room will have very few windows because they wouldn't want you to get distracted by seeing the sun or trees.",Boeing

And when the requirements change, oh no, they just give us what they had to contract and nothing more, it's not their business. So now we have to fix all the screw-ups and changes because management has no idea what it's doing, rework and rework. So management sees 'why are we having all this headcount, our workers are so expensive, and overtime here, clearly we have too many employees' instead of realizing that maybe they're working overtime because they have to fix the crap that was thrown at them because of stupidly written contracts. So they backfill the engineering and drafting requirements to India, where they can have twenty people working for the same cost as a person here in the real world of America. And the garbage they produced, they just hand out diplomas over there like it's rice curry, meaningless piece of paper, they have no idea about drafting standards and engineering requirements, all garbage work.

Firstly, I was unable to work for the first several months as they couldn't figure out how to get the basic requirements together. I literally had to come to work and do nothing for 8 hours each day. After that, when I did start working, on a small CRUD web application with one other dev, it was a total disaster. None of the people in charge or clarifying the requirements could agree on anything, so we were working on extremely vague requirements. Everyone I talked to would simply point their finger and someone else. By the time I had resigned, there was STILL no clear requirements. There was also no software development ""process"" to speak of - we were simply handed the very rough draft with vague instructions and told to get it done. The developers in the group seemed to be on a very low level. I never once got a clear answer about anything that I asked anyone. My manager, who was supposedly a developer for over a decade, had never heard of an ORM. This manager was also extremely ineffective - we had bi-weekly meetings but whenever I would ask her about anything, she would say that she didn't know and maybe I should ask someone else. We spent absurd amounts of time having meetings about safety, and watching videos about people doing working on the shop floor, despite the fact that we worked at desks in an office. Our group meetings were nothing but ""flowdown"" from ""the higher ups"" that consisted of topics that were not relevant to anyone in the group. For instance, we once had a long discussion about company cell phone usage despite the fact that no one in the group used a company cell phone. There was NEVER any talk about software development and its quality, despite the fact that we were a software development group - all the talk was about inane Boeing rules, policies, and corporate nonsense. Everyone constantly complained and was grumpy. It was the most negative and toxic work environment that I have ever seen. The older people talked constantly about how they couldn't wait to retire, and the younger people were totally disinterested in their work. There were many, many people who would do next to nothing all day every day. There were also widespread layoffs across all of IT that was handled very poorly - and they also laid off the most experienced employees first. There was also constant harping about how we needed to save the company money - by using the website self help instead of calling the IT help desk; by booking the absolute cheapest flights and hotel rooms if travelling - I had one tiny monitor because anything else was ""not in the budget"".

Weekly charges to a project (within any one tier) are however the same whether the individual is at the absolute lowest or highest in his pay band. Tier 3 individuals have been therefore preferentially viewed as the most cost effective choices for candidates for recent reduction in forces that the company has been forced to implement due to business downturns.

Flexible work hours if you aren't tied to production work in the factory. A place where a truly lazy person could probably make a career. You wont get good raises but you wont get fired either. Perhaps that should have been a con....","The difference in annual raises for someone that worked their butt off and someone that is average is roughly 1-2%. Average raises are in the 3-4% range with ""good"" years in the 5-6% range. Save the company a billion dollars? Here's a 5% raise! After a while, you realize that the extra 1-2% isn't worth the hassle of working so hard.... The company demographics are horrible. There is almost nobody there aged 35-55 with 15-25 years experience. It's those with less than 10 years and those with over 25 years and that's it. As a new hire or mid-level engineer, you're basically waiting for a bunch of old, fat white guys with 30+ years in to retire or die before you can truly move up the ranks. Half of them hate working there and wax nostalgic about the good ol' days from 20+ years ago. The negativity in the workforce ingrained over the last decade has become a cancer that has infiltrated the entire company. In their defense, much of this attitude has been a direct result of an adversarial and irrational relationship between top management and the engineers - care of the now (thankfully) former CEO. Maybe in another decade you might actually find people that enjoy working at this company again, but for now, morale is very low and people are frustrated with a company that is only a shell of what it used to be. Many of the older workers are on cruise-control, just waiting out the next 3-5 years before they can retire. With the loss of pensions, the trend of job-hopping rather than staying at one company, and big software firms nearby paying big bucks, I can't imagine most new hires will last the 15-20 years necessary to become replacements for the experts that will soon be retiring. The company reminds me much of IBM circa 1995... Bean counters run the company. Prepare to spend 1/3 of your time giving status, planning, and tracking once you hit mid-level. Despite all of that planning and tracking, things are still late and over budget. ""But *this* time we'll fix it all!"" This has driven the very same bean counters to demand more and more work be outsourced to outside companies. I have seen many unique, highly technical design jobs shipped out and never to return again. These are projects that get done once every decade or so. Sending it out even once means that the next time you want to do it internally, you'll be forced to re-invent the wheel since nobody will be around that remembers how to do it. I've even had the pleasure of major work being outsourced only to have that very same outsourcing company contact us directly and ask if we knew of another company that could do the work since they didn't actually know how but accepted the work anyway. This is the insanity that has become decision making at The Boeing Company. The company is over-reliant on processes. Ordering a box of screws from an outside vendor takes four separate people to process and approve the order and another half dozen to receive and deliver it 2-3 weeks later - if it doesn't get lost somewhere inside the company beforehand. This is something that I could order myself with a credit card in 10 minutes and have at my door in a few days. They took away purchase cards from engineers many years ago because they thought they were too wasteful. Starting to see the pattern yet? A laughably weak engineers union: Paid overtime (time plus $6.50, don't ask why) is great when you see folks in software working 60-70+ hours a week and getting paid for 40. However, the same union has made it difficult for management to fire the truly incompetent and/or lazy. Compound that over 40+ years and you end up with some truly stupid people being paid large sums of money to do nothing of actual value. The worst part is, many of these people don't even realize how truly screwed they would be if they had to find a job anywhere else. For instance: I have worked with ""engineers"" with over 20 years ""experience"" that could barely manage to produce work I would expect an intern to do and ask technical questions so basic that I wonder if they have serious memory problems. Layoffs are also done roughly based on seniority - which is exactly how they ended up with the horrible demographics they currently have in the first place. New hires notice that they get the axe while some seriously stupid people get to stay and guess what? They don't come back!",Boeing

Pay and benefits are probably above average if you can find placement at an appropriate level. If you have the skill, patience, and force of will to make things happen then there is vast room for improvement for teams with poor processes, work environment, and leadership.","Many teams are incompetently managed, and staffed with those who are ""retired in place"". There is much talk about One Boeing and RAA, but in fact more often different groups are defined by their antipathy toward other groups, and management strives to avoid blame more than anything. Managers shift jobs frequently to avoid having to live with the consequences of poor decisions. Some teams develop using antiquated technologies that you might assume no one has used for 30+ years. It can be very difficult, though possible, to effect change in the processes, tools, environment, and other factors that contribute to the success of projects. It's as if none of the leaders has read any of the canon on software project management, and so they don't even know that their bad decisions are cliches. Teams lack the authority to address most of these issues, and any change requires approval through at least 4 layers of management, and possibly one or more steering committees. No one even knows how to correctly measure productivity so sometimes they will replace 1 productive person with salary N with 3+ non-productive persons with salary N/2. I've heard of teams where 1 level 4 was doing 90% of the work on the team, and management (not even direct management) chose to ""lay off"" that individual, and now the team has hired 2-4 replacements level 1-2 employees, and they (of course) aren't able to do even a significant fraction of the work. I know of instances where senior high-salary employees are pushed out of the company as a short-sighted cost-saving measure.

Employees annual performance goals are more often than not extremely vague (purely qualitative instead of qualitative or tied to metrics) and therefore unattainable, which leaves your annual salary review mostly up to your manager's discretion. The culture lacks meritocracy. The workforce is (in general) miserable due to the perception of being overworked and underpaid. Complaining is rampant everywhere you go. Accountability is preached by executives, but not practiced in everyday running of business at the low levels of the company. In my experience many colleagues and coworkers fall behind on their tasks, play around on the internet, or in some cases don't do their job and it never seemed to be addressed by managers. Boeing denies many of its future business leaders opportunities for training and development. The company offers courses and certificate programs in Project Management, Six Sigma, and other Lean manufacturing concepts; but non-union management cites budgetary/time constraints, or non-applicability to job function if you step up and try to go after those certificates. The policies and procedures on the defense side of Boeing are in constant flux; so it can be challenging to adhere to your internal controls.

It's all about just working 80 hours per 2 weeks.","The pay/time tracking system is very annoying and stressful. I'm salaried, but each day I have to enter how many hours I spent on different tasks. Each task has an associated ""charge number"", the identifier which you input to say how many hours you've worked on that task. That's all fine, until you don't have enough tasks to really fill your day, you end up charging more to certain tasks than the time it actually takes. That can cause certain tasks or programs to go over budget. Management is in charge of finding tasks for their employees, but they're not that great at keeping the schedule full (understandably, it's hard to predict labor time). So it can be stressful showing up to work when you don't have a number to charge to. What do you do? Well you have to talk to your manager to find a task, or other managers, or you go home and use vacation time. Which is a terrible system. It's all because the government requires this micromanaging of employee scheduled to work on government contracts, so it's the nature of companies in this industry, which is unfortunate.

4027,"""Boeing - an okay place to work...""",3.0,"Boeing is the only company in the world that would make the guy who gets run over by an airplane and loses both legs and an arm –the company’s “safety ambassador”. Overall, Boeing is a decent company to work for. The pay appears to be competitive, the benefits are great, though come the contract re-negotiation in October of 2016, and the benefits will probably go down the toilet. In today’s currency (9/23/15) the pension will pay out around $100 per month per year of service. The company also does retirement matching for a 401K. Continuing education is awesome – Boeing will cover 100% of tuition and books (up to $20k per year). You are liable for repayment of the classes and books for 2 years after the anniversary of the beginning of the course, however. Any time a new program comes online, there are promotions to be had, and money to be made. Any new introduction will give opportunity for lots of lead and management positions. Upgrades are also a lot easier to get (engineer 1 to engineer 2, etc.) and will typically yield a $10k to $12k upgrade (regardless of level or experience). When the programs have returned to sustaining, then the level upgrades, lead, and management positions are much harder to get. A level upgrade will only yield around $3k to $4k.","As for corporate culture, it’s very “politically correct”. Cursing in public (bad practice, but sometimes it slips) can get you a trip to HR because someone gets their feelings hurt. Parking is horrible – plan on parking at least a mile out and riding a shuttle in. As for start time, most engineering groups will start somewhere between 5:00 am and 8:00 am, and the “choose your star time” rule typically applies. Much later than 9:00 am means there aren’t any parking spots left and you’ll be calling in sick. Leadership at the company is lacking, however. The majority of managers have been with the company for around 20 to 30 years, and enjoy their theory-X management style. They have no appreciation or understanding of millennials – and continue to run the company in an un-flexible technology-phobic manner. The company also like to throw around the word “innovative” – but doesn’t actually understand what it means. They think “how can we make this sheet metal bracket lighter and cheaper” instead of “what new technology can we employ that would eliminate the need for this bracket altogether”. There is also a HUGE issue with attrition, with people leaving on their 5-year anniversary (which is coincidentally the same time they are vested in their pension, and will rake in $500 a month once they retire in 30 years). Around 40% of the company has less than 10 years of experience, and 50% of the company will retire within the next 5 years. However, management doesn’t feel the need to groom the next generation of leaders because they are focusing 100% of their efforts on holding on for retirement.",Boeing

The company is so large that YMMV with department and location; this review reflects only my own experience. Boeing is the friendliest and most collegial place I have ever worked. I have seen very little politicking for personal advancement and no backstabbing whatsoever during my time there. Just about everyone I've met at Boeing, especially in engineering and production, has been smart, highly skilled, and a hard worker. Boeing invests in employ development. They paid for my MSEE and they have a huge number of internal courses available through the Ed Wells partnership. Middle and upper ranks are filled almost entirely from internal promotions. If you are in your late 30s with some experience, the coming wave of retirements and the demographic chasm above you means you can rise far and fast if you are smart and good. If you don't want to tell other people what to do but want instead to become an expert on an aspect of aircraft design and construction, the technical fellows program provides another path of advancement. Boeing is usually good about work-life balance, but if your group ends up with a compressed schedule, you may find yourself working a lot of extra hours. However, Boeing does pay overtime, which softens the blow when it's necessary. Channels of communication on safety issues is excellent. Everyone you know is going to use things you worked on (eventually). That's amazingly cool.","Boeing loves process more than life. This is necessary for what we do, but it can be draining if you are used to a more free-wheeling environment. Upper management is isolated (they in Chicago!!), clueless, and seems to be largely carried by lower level managers, engineers, and production folks. Outsourcing reduces the efficiency of development. I find the claim that it reduces costs overall to be a very bad joke, told at our expense. Parking at the Everett facility is atrocious.

The company has developed multiple sites and pits them against each other to justify paying workers less and to destroy the unions in Seattle. While this may cut costs in the short term, it has created various groups which refuse to share information with each other (leading to a collapse in collaboration and groups claiming the work of other groups). In a professional atmosphere this is EXTREMELY corrosive. Senior level engineers are afraid to share information because upper management will give this information to other sites to spur competition when the sites ""bid"" for new work. (How do sites within the same company ""bid"" for engineering work?) Furthermore, their biggest new site, Charleston, has extraordinarily incompetent engineers (but they're cheaper, so why not) that are being propped up by bright contract engineers while upper management attempts to lure more permanent and competent engineers there to train them. In addition, the company managers routinely lie to the engineers about work and future prospects to cut costs. One year they announced that they had to cut back on staff and could not give promotions because there was a shortage of long term work. This was a year after they announced our site would be getting a huge long-term project. Literally a month after they denied promotions and four months after they fired people, a glut of long term work from another existing Boeing program miraculously appeared.

Easy to move around within the company to try new jobs, different locations/cities/states, or different divisions (commercial, defense, services, corporate).

There is a pretty strict years of service rule before you can attempt to go to the next level, even if you are already doing the work. It's still a good old boys club and there are lots of office politics and so many levels of management that you have to get buy-in from before moving on with decision making. It is a slow moving world b/c of the approval processes for practically everything. They talk a lot about caring for their people and work/life balance but then they make it really hard to take time off (though I think some of that depends on who your manager is). Most managers are old school but I do think there are more younger managers coming into play now as first levels but they still have to do what their senior managers, directors, and above... tell them to do so it's not as though they have much control. Time keeping is tracked daily and scrutinized even for salaried employees. Vacation and Sick leave are separate buckets. PTO would be so much better like other companies do it. My overall experience with managers who give recognition to their employees is pretty low. They have multiple incentive programs but it seems that most managers (maybe 75%) dont use them. It is very unfortunate. Year end merit raises are a joke (2-3% and dropping) and they are making it harder and harder for you to meet the goals they make you agree to. On the Boeing Commercial side they are forcing a 20% (exceeds) 60% (meets) 20% (does not meet) rule for all non-management employees within each managers team (so if you have 3 people on your team one of you must be put into the ""does not meet"" category.

Boeing has sent a clear message that they don't care about their IT / Software Development skills or retaining talent with their rampant layoffs of the IT organization. The culture believes their competitive advantage is within improving ""the process"" not in the system architecture that runs ""the process"". Buying vendor commercial software and customizing it fit the companies needs is ingrained into the culture, even though the last couple decades have proved that is not a viable solution for their ""superior"" manufacturing process. Raises are nearly impossible to achieve on good merit. Advancement is pretty formulaic by the numbers of years at the company, even then it is no guarantee. It is common place for an easily justified upgrade to be postponed for years due to money mismanagement and their convoluted system of skill code pools and money allotment. Also, pay is abysmally low for software dev skills, as an employee with 1-5 years. However, management will always claim they are competitive if you look at the full package. This is a lie, there is no competition other tech companies are at least 30-50% more base pay with similar benefits. I would be cautious about accepting a software / IT job at Boeing, their current strategy is to ""layoff"" all expensive employees with this skill set and hire cheaper inexperienced labor in South Carolina. I suspect the company has about 3-4 years left of this cycle before the IT infrastructure will completely collapse.

It is very hard to get anything done effectively or efficiently due to the lack of consistent process and a culture that reinforces individual contributions, rather that collaboration and teaming. The higher you go the more it feels like it's every person for themselves. A LOT of ego involved at the top, and all along the way. Company culture and values are all based on execution and cost reductions. There seems to be a lack of understanding that if you treat your people well they will in turn be more engaged resulting in increased efficiency and reduced cost.

This is done at the expense of mid-level and senior engineers who are just discarded after they reach 45-50 years old. Seniority and competence have been weeded out on most programs as undesirable strengths within Engineering. - Salaries are constrained to 20-35% below the market for Engineers in Los Angeles, CA.

It’s beyond your worse nightmare of how bad soul-crushing bureaucracy can be, far worse than your favorite Dilbert cartoons. Upper management’s endless rules and ever-diminishing benefits indicate their total lack of respect for workers, although they always claim the opposite in their Orwellian babble. If you do make a mistake and come here to work, you will be working to put other people out of work. Why? Oh, we have to cut costs … blah … blah … Airbus (scary!) … blah … blah … and those costs are your salary, never any savings from upper management’s golden coffers. So, the CEO and his minions want you to save costs (= put other people out of work) until YOU become the cost he wants to save. And all the while your skills will continue to erode and you will steadily be less employable elsewhere. I spent nine years working in the research group. At first, I believed their lies that all the changes that were being made would make the research group better. But every year it got worse.

People - In my experience I have been able to work with experts (in their respected fields) and have enjoyed the exposure of working with them. Growth - In the short time I've been with BCA (3yrs) if there was an area of growth (training, exposure) I wanted to participate in, my managers (I've had 3 different managers) have all been supportive, so I do not think it was just the people I worked for but rather the company makes it apparent it values training and broadening it's employees. Very unique experiences - depending on job can participate in flight testing of airplanes (not as exciting as it sounds, but still very cool), opportunities to travel (I recently switched groups for more growth and in both jobs I've been presented opportunities to travel to the far east for 2 weeks or to other parts of the US for onsite evaluations).

Doesn't have that ""wondrous"" vibe you get when you think of Google (but I've never worked/been to google).

Change takes forever to implement and some people feel no sense of urgency. - Many people are wary of announcing their retirement plans too early because they may not get a good raise or be ranked lower in retention ratings (used to determine who will be laid off first during a downturn).

They have persevered through tremendously difficult working conditions.","The company is filled with fine, hardworking people being strangled by the incompetence and greed of those at the top. The priority is to cut costs and you will be working to eliminate other people's jobs until your turn comes, too. If you have a PhD, you can watch your career slowly erode the longer you stay here. This company does not value research done in-house. Instead, they believe all useful research comes from universities, which they fund, or small companies, which they buy and engulf. Your creative ideas will languish if they do not fit into the current corporate vertical silos. There is constant shuffling above you, which is inevitable as there are so many layers. The managers you know are all good people and very personable. The ones you only see on webcasts are the ones eliminating jobs even when the company is raking in record profits. They say they are doing it for the good of the company. Sorry, if you are not on board. Young people are encouraged to join to use the ping pong tables. Higher-paid personnel are encouraged to leave by periodically shuffling jobs and reducing funding. Before you find the exit door, either walking out or being pushed from behind, you can slowly strangle in a maze of red tape. You will spend somewhere between 20 and 40% of your time looking for funds and complying with an ever increasing mountain of rules. You cannot charge the time to overhead as you can only charge about 1 hour per week to that. Nor to a project. In short, there are a plethora of unfunded mandates you must comply with. Some examples may help. Do you want to buy a book or some utility software for a project? No problem. Just fill out a form for the book, make sure the library does not have it, get someone else to sign, then wait a few weeks. For the software, fill out a NSJ (non-standard software justification) and wait several weeks for Purchasing to buy it for you. What, you need it now? Well, you can always buy it yourself, as many employees do. Oh, you charged it to your travel card, instead of finding someone with a P-card (purchase card)? No problem, just fill out this LOD (letter of deviation, you deviant), and get signatures of your manager, their manager, and their manager's manager. You'll soon learn all the key acronyms and PROs (procedures). Sorry, little time for technical work. I told you that's what universities and small companies are for. Your job is to take their work and apply it when you have time and funding. The place is a maddening mixture of insanity that would make Franz Kafka, Joseph Heller, and George Orwell proud. 'Repositioning' and 'geographic diversity' really mean laying off higher paid (older) workers and expecting employees to reapply for their same jobs with less money in less desirable locations such as Alabama. Welcome to the land of Dilbert. You will constantly be experiencing friction in getting your work done by interference from upper management. If you want to write a paper or give a presentation outside the company, you need to submit your paper 6 weeks in advance. Then another 6 weeks to make the changes for camera ready copy, which must normally be returned within 2 or 3 weeks if your paper is to be published. Upper management is amazingly busy. Busy reorganizing the company, deciding where to place you, inventing new names for new sub-organizations, cost-cutting, embracing the latest management fads, absorbing small companies, devising new metrics to 'flow down' to 'scorecards' on which your 'PE' (performance evaluation) will ultimately depend. The cost-cutting involves such matters as eliminating unused phone lines, replacing employee functions with new websites (each so badly designed that you need a 'ten-minute trainer' when you just want to get something done and don't have time for the nonsense). And always, always, adding new rules and regulations rather than eliminating red tape or upper management interference. Another metaphor may help. Your relationship with upper management takes on characteristics of an abusive relationship. They tell you what to do. They do not listen to you, while pretending they do. They will try to convince you that everything is going well, they are interested in research, they value technical staff, and that we all share in the profits of the company. But, the truth is that things are going well for them; things get worse every year for the technical staff; upper management only wants applications of outsiders' research; and upper management can have raises of 15% or so, while yours will be below the cost of living even if you are rated 'effective.' A stacked ranking system is used, so most employees fall in the middle of the bell curve, and receive ratings of 'effective.' Upper management will gaslight you, saying their actions (e.g., 'repositioning' and 'geographic diversity') encourage diversity, while their intentions are just the opposite (bust unions and save money by getting rid of more expensive, older workers). In the beginning, you will hope your perceptions are wrong, and they will encourage you in that belief. Over time your self-confidence and self-perception will erode as management will deprive you of the resources you need to maintain your career (e.g., conference attendance, which is considered a 'perk' by upper management.) If you spend too much money on a project, you will be questioned. If you spend too little on a project, you will be questioned. So how can you do long-term research? Well, the idea appears to be that you win CRAD contracts and the government pays for your research. Unfortunately, government agencies, oddly enough, seem to want to fund organizations with new exciting ideas and existing software already developed to at least a proof of concept stage. Most of the current ATFs (associate technical fellows) were around in the pre-merger days, when lower level managers had funds and the funds were easily available to investigate new ideas. There is so much more that I only have time to touch on: ethics classes; the voice mail hell of TotalAccess; that management is secretly instructed not to tell you key info; upper management's financial micromanagement; the bean counters and MBAs in Chicago that will run your life, but you will never see. I could go on, but I think you get the idea. In short, why would you want to come here? There used to be advantages to working for a large company: primarily job security, pension, and good benefits for which you were willing to put with a lot of bureaucracy. None of those reasons apply any more. So why would you want to work here if you could work for a small company? You are just as likely to be laid off, you won't get a pension, and you won't be allowed to stay current with your skills. It is a shame that a company that makes so many interesting products and has so much potential for interesting research has instead severely crippled its research capabilities, scientists, and engineers due to terribly misguided management.",Boeing

The Boeing corporate portion paints a rosey picture of how great the Boeing culture is and you get a warm fuzzy all over. Then the union comes in and pretty much deflates everything and paints a very dark picture of Boeing. That is after you are forced into a Union. Yes folks, being part of a union is MANDATORY. They are quick about taking your money as well. Next, off to training. Not job specific. It's three days of learning how to set up an email account, choose benefits, go over Boeing / I AM joint programs, Web based training on safety, ethics compliance and such. On to my assigned work location. I reported to be assigned plant and met my manager and safety focal. A tour of the facilities was next. Lots and lots of old, and I mean OLD milling machines. As old as the people that work there that are retiring in masses. My first real day followed and I started to see what Boeing is. The last union contract negotiated had a lot of take aways, the biggest one being the replacement of the famed Boeing pension witha 401k. This has the majority of the people there very mad and bitter. You can cut the negativity in the air with a knife which makes new comers like me uncomfortable to say the least. Then there is an acceptance issue. These guys have been there so long that there is a hierarchy, a pecking order, if you will, where new comers are made to feel left out and unwelcome. This falls in hand with the next con. OJT. If you are an outsider with no experience with milling machines or CNC (computer numerical control) systems....God help you. I've tried to be in on the trouble calls, troubleshooting and just trying to learn the basics of this new job. I was left with having to look over people's shoulders trying to get a feel for what is happening and try to ask questions only to get bumped out of the way and grunted at when trying to ask questions. After a few weeks of this type of behavior and just observing, one of the senior guys had the audacity to tell me I needed to get into the habit of asking questions. My reply was ""My only question is, what is going on? It's hard to ask questions after getting snubbed so many times by so many people, including you!"" He got mad and walked away. Strike 1 for me for wanting to learn. Later on, I overheard several conversations of how the best revenge against Boeing and the Union for the contract take aways was to not train the new hires and retire before the pension goes away. Try showing some initiative? Well, the first time I did that on a trouble call, I got a talking to by a senior tech about my place in the shop. I was made to feel like I was stepping on his toes when I was feeling desperate to make a contribution to something...anything. So much for trying. No recourse because in a union, seniority rules the roost and I'm at the bottom of the chip pile. Strike 2 for me for wanting to contribute. Safety is a running joke here. The machines are so old and in dire need of safety retrofits but the cost would be too great. Need to secure power to a motor? Pull the 408 VAC fuses with the power still on. There is lock out, tag, try out training that is mandatory for technicians and mechanics but it is very generic. If you don't know how to work on a tool safely due to lack of training and are thrown at something because you are a warm body, the training is pointless. I'm already looking for a new job. The negativity is suffocating to the point where I wake up every day dry heaving and fretting about going to work. There will be no strike 3 for me. Maybe it's a union thing. I just dont know.

There is a no managerial bullying/harassment policy, but under the covers it is a joke. HR takes the managers side and does not enforce policies. Executives seem to be on a revolving door plan while doing very bad things with their co-workers and/or employees. Three senior executives have been walked out the door in the past year due to ethical and/or probable legal violations. Two landed with other partner companies who do business with Boeing and Boeing does nothing to end the partnerships. This leaves us peons scratching our heads. When our customers hear of this (and they do because our community is small), they are none too happy to work with our company moving forward. When we try to bring our friends in for jobs they don't want to come as well. Lots of job consolidations and layoffs over the past three years also while some people clearly not fit for positions remain on staff. There isn't any career upward mobility now due to defense and intelligence spending cuts and I think this is the same at every large defense and intelligence contractor. Health plan is degrading yearly with less benefits and higher deductible prices. Talk of eliminating the pension plan is looming over everyone's head.

It's very easy to stand out in most areas--in many places you can 'stand out' by simply being mediocre if that's your thing! On the other hand, as such a very large company it is not easy to distinguish yourself on an exceptional level. Compensation and benefits are pretty good. They have a nice tuition assistance program if you'd like to get that Masters. It used to be much better but it's definitely something people should take advantage of if they can. Of course it depends on where you are, what you do, and what union you may be in but for the most part job security is very high. In fact, to get fired from Boeing you practically have to put a concentrated effort into it. As for layoffs, aerospace is very cyclic and you just need to be aware of your role and how it pertains to those cycles. Put some thought into what you do or want to do and how much it is a 'recurring' vs a 'non-recurring' requirement where you are. In the event that your job is 'phased' out Boeing does make an effort to find you work elsewhere if you're an engineer. It might be out of your own pocket and you might be moving to another state, but they will give you that option for the most part. They never will cut your pay, even if you move somewhere with a lower cost of living.","Well, number one and probably the most well known problem Boeing has is the 'age gap.' You have a growing, younger workforce in their late 20's to early 30's and then you have your over 50 crowd. There is a disturbing lack of many people that don't fall into either bucket. The reasons for that are layoffs based on seniority in the past primarily but there are other factors. It's not as bad as it was, of course, but the damage has been done. There have been plenty of opportunities to diminish this risk for a long time now and it's frequently just been talk and not action. We're at point that it's getting too late for even action. Boeing does not understand or acknowledge the technical and engineering skills they are going to lose en masse in 2016, and they can talk about it all they want but they haven't put any concentrated effort into mentoring or knowledge transfer from that 50+ to that 20-35 crowd. We'll see if they can 'weather the storm' as I have resigned myself to seeing as their 'solution' to this problem. The benefits, while decent, have consistently been cut and scaled down especially over the last few years. Even for union folks. New employees no longer get a pension and it's being actively phased out for all existing employees depending on their union status. I have no problem with this, but many do. Promotions are awful. As an engineer you are evaluated by a team of your peers called a ""skill team."" Many of these individuals aren't in a place to evaluate expertise in a given skill, and, for my job code at least, there are over 20 'skills' and you have to be at or above a certain level of proficiency in required number of skills for each 'level.' This is often very unfair because of the sheer number of these skills and how vague and pointless many of them are to your particular role--nobody is going to be able to realistically develop all of them or even need to for them to be an excellent engineer. The way it is currently structured you might have to do something entirely non value added and of no value to your organization or the company or yourself just so you can advance your 'skill matrix.' Unfortunately many folks have to get very creative and perhaps not entirely honest about these 'skills' and the 'examples' required to prove what level they're at and it just ends up being a completely meaningless and ultimately political process. Boeing hires way too many managers over technical or engineering people with little to no technical experience. That would be fine if they would stick to management and utilize their employees knowledge and expertise to make decisions. Unfortunately there are a lot of people with BA degrees that think directly managing engineers makes them one! Overtime, if that's your thing, isn't what it used to be. You may have heard the concept of nearly 'unlimited' overtime in Boeing. While that is still true in some places, don't structure your lifestyle around overtime. I hate overtime and have never run my life around it but many people do. That's standard advice for any employee, but it's especially prudent now. First level managers don't get paid for OT anymore as of this year and, what do you know, there's a massive effort to reduce OT so those guys don't have to draw the lottery to see who works that weekend (for free). As an engineer that works OT when necessary (no more than a few weekends a year if I can possibly avoid it), I have found all requests denied in lieu of flexing my time where it would never have been a problem whatsoever in the past. Flexing is a good option to have, but it's still a net loss in work necessary beyond regular time. Of course, as production rates increase and are poorly coordinated and planned the old ""unlimited OT"" might come back but keep it in mind if it's your thing.",Boeing

Boeing has been know for its pension and generous benefits. Although these benefits have vanished for new comers, those who have a pension and 2 or more decades at Boeing have a lot to lose especially when the cost cutting trend is now in full swing. Hanging on until eligibility is rather a complex game; trickier at the top than at the bottom. Employee surveys for instance can really affect a manager's retirement. Employee surveys measure engagement. Gallup studies have shown a strong correlation between Engagement an future earnings. A low employee engagement, meaning a low participation in the employee survey affect stock option and stock related bonuses: the type of bonus once get at the director and executive levels. Affect their bonuses and it trickles down to the managers. So what should Managers who have a pension to lose do? Be the advocate of their subordinates and risk losing their pension? That would go against human nature. Cowering is the logical answer as Chairman Jim McNerney pointed out right after an earning call with investors. The time could not have been more appropriate. The more benefits waiting their maturity date the more cowering. A negative feedback loop reinforced from the Chairman down to the hourly employee. Looking at demographics, the average age at Boeing is right around 46. Although a significant percentage of Boeing employees are now eligible to retire (first wave of baby boomers), most are not there yet, but close. During a cost cutting trend, one can only imagine how excruciating the wait might be for those directors and managers. cowering is a predictable consequence. cowering and fearing nurture discontent. fuel the fire with unions, and incidentally fuel the employee survey. Although the survey might show a high percentage of discontentment, the mere participation in an employee survey helps raise the engagement percentage up which in turns helps directors and executives stock option and retirement bonuses--cowering feeds the top layers. Based on baby boomer pension benefits and retirement waves still to come, the cowering at Boeing is bound to last another decade at least.

Experienced Baby Boomers (Craftsman) are jumping off the ship leaving the less qualified to build the aircraft. New Supervisors with less than 3 years experience on the shop floor, don't know much about the processes required to build an airplane. Company takes away more and more with each contract. Union and Non-union workers treated like cattle while upper management rake in large bonuses. Bias in pay for similar jobs, A Manufacturing Engineer working in the Interior Responsibility Center makes on average $20,000 less than a Manufacturing Engineer working in Finale Assembly. Work offloaded overseas needs continual audit and rework. Have witnessed employees being harassed and bullied. When reported Human Resources and Supervision turns a blind eye. Parking can be horrendous. Employees have already lost their pension, medical payment for co-pays and deductibles are increasing. Merit pools are decreasing. Pay for Performance is a joke. Boeing with the realization that Baby Boomers in the thousands will soon retire is hiring new employees at lower and lower salaries. The Baby Boomers with tons of experience also attain very high salaries. Those high salaries will soon disappear. By holding down new hires the company will receive a large boost in profits. Combine that with loss of a pension, increased deductibles, and higher co-pays the company will reap larger profits on the backs of the employees. As the profits increase the wealth I believe should be shared equally but it is not. The bonus pools for upper management in 2012 increased 54%. I believe McNerny's increase in compensation was $23 million dollars. If there are 25 people per supervisor, I would estimate that 4 are not needed. Many are looking to climb the ladder of success but not willing to learn the basics of the job before them. Others are allowed to escape work by attending Safety Meetings, Morale Boosting meetings, any function they can find outside of performing their given tasks, and a good share find they can carry a clip board and find people to socialize with in other areas of the building for hours. Lunch is 40 minutes for the Techs and Profs but 1/hr or more is the norm. Many including Supervisors arrive to work then disappear to eat breakfast in the cafeterias.

There are many great, talented people working here.","There is very little, if any space, to move up in the company. You're forced to job hop every few years if you want any career progression. Lower management typically doesn't listen to the technical staff; excepting the one manager I mentioned above, the rest of management doesn't seem to be good at aligning skill sets with tasking, or managing knowledge transfer. Most management is ineffective at best - a manager recently called a staff meeting at the last minute to say that there was no new or solid information on several rumors floating around. Schedules are unrealistic and people are expected to do increasingly more or multitask work for little reward in terms of promotion or better raises. There is very little carrot and a whole lot of stick. There is a serious lack of diversity here, both in people and ideas/innovation. There is a disconnect between Big Boeing Policy and what actually happens here. For an example, we had a huge Go For Zero Safety training initiative last year. Employee safety is supposed to be the number one priority. But during the great December ice storm of 2013, we were still required to go to work, even though weather personnel and emergency crews all advised people to stay at home. If employee safety was truly considered a top priority, employees would have been told to stay home, as opposed to choose between burning a vacation day/flex time or hazard the bad roads and weather to work in a mostly empty building.",Boeing

Management are scared of their own shadow. Every last one of them is afraid of making a call. They all just wait around for some other manager to make a decision so they cant be blamed if it turns out bad. But not to worry, you will get a new manager every few weeks or months. Then, this new manager that doesn't know you gets to write your performance review and blame your previous managers for anything negative in it. There are far to many non work related tasks that are asked of employees. Safety focal, tool focal, FOD focal, safety observations, 5S, etc. They always seem to have new and inventive policies for you to violate in order to give you a CAM. And of course, a CAM equals no pay raise that year. They are also prone to going into panic overtime mode due to not meeting poorly estimated timelines given to customers or contract bids. This panic overtime usually equal 12 hour shifts 7 days a week. But of course, managers ""aren't allowed"" to work overtime. If you need a tool or have an idea how to fix or make something better, be ready to fork over a TBBI, VSM, time study, cost analysis, etc. Then wait a few months or years. The quality assurance department is typically filled with very un-knowledgeable know it alls. Many of them seem to have been put there because they can't or wont fire them but want them off the aircraft in a maintenance capacity. As a whole the QA personal are very adversarial. If you give 110% your only reward is more being asked of you. This usually means you get to do all of your work and some of someone else's. It seems to me that there a far more ""support"" and ""overhead"" people than aircraft touch labor workers. I constantly see new people with grand sounding titles that seem to do little to nothing value added (that's some Boeing speak). In fact, the support usually wants you to do all the work for them. But of course they don't work overtime, nights, or weekends so good luck finding one to hand over the work you did for them.

If you go over, you can flex it, and no one will think any less of you - unless there's an impacting customer issue, of course. For younger hires, going to school while working at Boeing is pretty easy if you don't have a family. Boeing has a decent education reimbursement program to facilitate this. + Good Total Compensation: Many people complain that they aren't compensated well at Boeing. It's true they do not pay top salary for most job positions, however, they make it up in a comprehensive benefits package as well as a lot of off-time in the form of holiday, sick leave, AND vacation time. Salaried even gets over time. Also, union positions are in no position to complain about their salary. + A Position for Everyone: Boeing hires everything from aerospace engineers and accountants to firefighters and weathermen. If you want to do a career change, you don't have to leave the company to do it. + Job Security: You have to actively try to get fired. It's really obscene. I never saw someone get fired for poor job performance. You can only get fired if you do something really blatant like steal from the company, start a fight, bring a gun, intimidate someone - basically anything that can cause legal trouble for Boeing if they don't fire you. Boeing makes a lot of headlines when they do layoffs, but quite frankly, I didn't know anyone who got laid off who didn't see it coming. Boeing keeps programs going well after the point that they should have been killed off.","+ Slow Pace: Boeing, along with the rest of the airline industry, is obsessed with safety. As a result, the pace of innovation is very slow. Few people in the company get to really push boundaries and make a dent in the universe. Those that do have to stay with the company for years - it takes a long time to make/change an aircraft design. + Lazy Culture: Because of the obscenely high amount of job security, good compensation, and slow pace, the large portion of the population is complacent. Those who want to change the world and make a difference leave, leaving a bunch of B level performers. New ""As"" either turn back around and leave, or they themselves become complacent, having no reason to try hard. Even the best aerospace engineers typically leave and come back as a consultant, getting paid even more than what Boeing already offers the engineering union. + Ageism: There's a huge age gap in the company in all areas. This often manifests itself in impatient ""kids"" wanting to do something new, but are actively discouraged or ignored by the ""old timers"" who think they know the right way to do everything. Promotions are only partially merit based, and much of it requires a certain number of years at a certain level as per the ""process"". There are many 1st level managers who go their position solely because they've been at the company for decades with no excuse to let them go. Overall, I recommend Boeing for those who prioritize a stable job and good work life balance over anything else - it's a good family job. Also, engineers (those that can get a SPEEA union job) should go into Boeing. No brainer. The compensation and job security are stupidly high for SPEEA.

If you working for the company for less than 5 years there is always the threat of layoffs which you don't find out about until the day at work and you are handed a notice that in 60 days you maybe let go. The union that you are assigned to at times can be very aggressive and they create a stressful environment in the time of contract negations. Also, be prepared for a strike either by having another job lined up or having enough savings lined up so that you can survive on them while out of work during the strike. The management seems to support shift wars between the three shifts and this at times this causes issues where we have what appears to be work issues between what is being done and perception of what is being accomplished. The managers at time don't know how to lead and build a team, instead it is all about trying to do better than your fellow teams even on the same shift. Begin to accept that overtime although ""voluntary"" the reality is that it is actually mandatory with the threat of negative paperwork to HR if you chose not to show up and management designates you. Which only leads towards the use and abuse of benefits like vacation and sick leave to guarantee time off. At times upward mobility is restricted by unrealistic ""gatekeeping"" on internal job postings. I mean realistically for a level 2 or 3 engineering or management jobs you have postings asking for Master and PhD level educations in jobs that only pay 5-8k more than the entry level jobs.

Plus, once hired, it's pretty much a guaranteed job. The work can be very easy, so those with families can go home without anything on their mind.","In software, Boeing recruiting cannot compete with Amazon, Microsoft, Google and the other software giants with offices near Seattle. They start off with the leftovers, which luckily has some diamonds in the rough. These ""diamonds,"" along with any talent, leave the company within 1-3 years. It's a breath of fresh air to finally meet someone that knows what he is talking about, but then devastating to see him go 6 months later. Boeing isn't a software company, so an appropriate comparison is with Bank of America, with their 1 million lines of COBOL. Boeing has less COBOL, but it's common to see very, very, very old languages. Join this company if you like time travel. Boeing has a level hierarchy and believes anyone can transfer to completely different jobs while maintaining his or her level. Combined with the restriction from asking technical questions during an interview, this leaves unqualified individuals, with excellent flattery abilities, leading the organization. I had two software managers: one was formerly an HR manager and the other was a sales manager because, at Boeing, managers can move horizontally across completely unrelated business units. Managing is always the same right? It gets better when working with the software architect who is an English major. It's difficult, if not impossible, to do anything the right way. The decision makers and those advising the decision makers are usually the weakest technically. Plus, they can't expose their incompetence, so they never ask questions. No engineer want's to create a bad product though, so a lot of time is spent explaining things to these decision makers. This leads me to something I almost forgot: time tracking. Boeing has a modern version of the punch card; they added the ability to charge to different groups and an alert system to notify managers of ""noncompliance."" An example will explain how bothersome this is: You go to your manager asking to explain something. She asks you to pause as she switches her time card to reflect this informal meeting. Then asks you to do the same and you reply with what to charge to. Now, as you explain to her, you have to read her eyes to pry what she still doesn't understand. After that meeting, you go back to your desk and change the time card again, satisfied with the great explanation only to find an e-mail 5 minutes later asking for a summary of the meeting. Now you have to switch your time card again, write up the summary, and switch once again upon completion. I've described many cons, but overall, Boeing isn't a terrible company.",Boeing

And, annoyingly, every division and department within those divisions use their own - so when you move to a new position, you're essentially starting from scratch again.

The long hours and demands on employees to be available to respond outside of work do not make for much of a life outside the workplace. There is also a very strong bias toward young employees and a high degree of social stratification among the engineers. The worst part of BCAG is its elitist management, which is generally condescending and arrogant toward the employee. There is very poor interaction between the employees and management, except for the intense competition among employees for recognition which is how management stays in control; it is only their power to reward that engenders loyalty. Boeing is generally good for corporate governance, but it has no teeth to it in Everett. Also, the company has installed an RFID system to track employee movements with their badges.

This place is very baby-boomer heavy as other posters have mentioned. They are a few years away from retirement. Boeing is very good at making up its own terms and its own initiatives and never following industry trends for software engineering for example. Lots of processes need serious revamping. This company has an extremely change-resistant culture. People are very used to doing things the same way they did 20+ years ago and would rather never change it despite today's rapidly dynamic economy. Over the years, I have seen many people attempt to introduce recent industry trends into the particular group. It's all started but then dies out after a few months. Depending on where you work in the St. Louis facility, many of the facilities are just awful. You don't even have your own cube unless you're a manager. The area Boeing is at in St. Louis is just slummy and depressing. There are a ton of people in this place that shouldn't have a job here.

They've gotten more strict this past year so review the latest information if anything has changed. Outside of the LTP program, your group's training budget and support for professional certifications is very dependent on your manager.

Boeing says that they have a mentoring program, but in my experience it is mostly in name only. Mentors are ""highly encouraged"" to get mentorees but there's no structure or accountability to actually DO any mentoring, and there's no attempt to connect you with mentors in similar careers outside of your own little group.

There are a number of challenges available, but the culture tends to avoid change and fight ""out of the box"" thinking. If a person is allowed to be really creative, then, no pun intended, the sky is the limit. There is some REALLY neat technology being developed at Boeing. And there are some fabulous managers, in various divisions. In addition, the company uses, and encourages the use of, modern technology. Telecommuting, hoteling, etc. are all encouraged and financially supported by the Boeing.","Unfortunately, the Boeing culture does not reward 'new' thinking or even questions as to 'why?'. There are pockets of the company that truly does encourage divergent options, but those are rare. Senior Management tend to reward like thinking and overlook those who question the status quo....even when those questions are professional, appropriate, and highly thoughtful. The Boeing legacy is rich in developmental history, technology, and foresight, however, the current environment does not even recognize the value of contributions from acquired organizations (e.g. Hughes, North American, Rocketdyne, etc.). In truth, there is still exists quite a bit of the Boeing vs. Mac Dac/Hughes/etc. mentality. Additionally, the management emphasis is on cultural diversity, but it is defined in gender and ethnic terms and not by experience or professional background. There are other aerospace organizations that place a higher value on diversity of experience than Boeing. And that will ultimately be Boeing's downfall. Few if the senior managers ever get out and spend any time with the employees. They tend to be isolated and removed from day-to-day issues, pressures, problems and opportunities. For example, the head of the technology division did not speak to his 25,000 employees until he had been in the job for 18 months. And then the communication was via a one way web-cast. And finally, employees are rarely listened to. The words and music are good, but they are not backed up by actions. There is extensive talk about knowledge management, information access and sharing, and shared values/culture. In practice however, there is little sharing and a lot of information hording. One has to know to who to talk to in order to get information.",Boeing

By this I mean they will be so focused on meeting schedule that they will make decisions to complete a task poorly, to check it off their schedule, and that work will need to be redone later.

Layoffs are done via job description and not by effectiveness. My project manager does absolutely nothing, and apparently this is not uncommon. There are many people who have no idea what they are doing, but is nothing done about it. Promotions are apparently few and far between. Sick leave is ridiculous.

The stress of the job can stay at work, and rarely do projects invade the ""after work"" time of the average engineer. There is flexibility in your work schedule (at least in my experience) with virtual work and flex time as necessary. The education benefits are par excellence, and if you take advantage of them make the salaries competitive in the market; adjunct to this is the availability of training and conference attendance both of which are encouraged and funded. Also, if you like to keep your stress levels low, then--barring a few notable exceptions--Boeing is the perfect place to be. And lastly, if you adore the domain, Boeing is one of the few places where you get to fully experience the aerospace culture.","Software Development Knowledge Vacuum: From the perspective of a software engineer, Boeing lacks an understanding of what is necessary to produce top-notch software Because Boeing managers do not have to have experience in the domain of their employees, it is not uncommon to see software managers who have no software experience. As a software developer, chances are that you will not have any say in the specification and design of your system, because that job will likely be handed to functional analysts or external contractors. Standards and practices are routinely ignored in favor of whatever technologies developers are familiar with. Lack of Performance-Oriented Goals: If your project fails, you might get a raise. If your project succeeds, you might get nothing. There is often an unspoken understanding of who is dead weight in a group, and who pulls the majority of the load (the former group seems much larger than the latter), however, those two groups are treated no differently, and it's not uncommon to see one of the deadwood members promoted to PM or Principle because a manager does not know what else to do with them. Problem employees are not addressed - managers wait for them to leave. Compensation: As a software engineer in Seattle, you are paid about substantially less than a software developer at a large software company. Generally speaking, there is little drive to produce. Teams are given longer-than-necessary times to execute projects (for instance, we have one year to complete about 6 weeks worth of work, currently) and there is no real reward for finishing quickly or meeting customer expectations. This is supported by a very bloated infrastructure where getting the necessary tools for a project can take weeks or months.

Reasons included a) not being at the my current position long enough; b) there were other engineers who had been waiting for a promotion longer. 2) no technical excellence :: there is little or no technical excellence remaining at the company. much of the engineering work is done from the books, with engineers being reduced to highly paid librarians for customers 3) aerospace engineering trumps all :: even though one of degrees is in the primary domain of the company, being an engineer of that domain (aerospace) trumps everything else. as a person with other degrees in software and computational engineering; I often encountered aerospace engineers who could not pass data structures 101 yet were leads for very visible, externally facing software projects. 4) everyone is a widget :: management regularly shuffles people around to different jobs as the company constantly tries to restructure. instead of making employees accountable, management instead places people in areas where they have zero experience or education that qualifies them for the position. I have seen people with zero engineering background other than act as technical editors become promoted into engineering; only to see them a few years later move to another engineering position in a startup program that requires actual engineer. Note, people with B.As in English literature are designing your airplanes you ride on. 5) lethargic, slow :: decisions that take 1 hour to 1 day in my current job have traditionally taken 6-12 months at the Boeing company. 6) drowning in people :: Q: How many Boeing engineers does it take to screw in a light bulb? A: All of them. In my current position we are empowered to make business decisions and enact solutions on a regular basis. More so, many customer-facing initiatives are started and finished in a day. I have seen similar functionality started at Boeing with 6 or more engineers and take 12-18 months. 7) there is no IT :: With the exception of IDS (Boeing's Integrated Defense Systems), if you wish to do anything remotely involved with software then this is not a good company to work for. Programmers are not trained for the work they do, or have any formal training in computer science or software engineering.

The environment we work in doesn't foster that. As an engineer in the first 4-6 years of your career, it's particularly difficult. You are left to your own devices to gain knowledge and experience. It slows the skill acquisition process. On the other hand, if you are self motivated and have the ability to learn on your own, your efforts will be recognized and you'll advance.

The goal is normally to deliver a product that will do a better job for the customer, not just attempting to figure out how to make a component 3 cents cheaper without concern for whether or not it will do the job as well. In most areas, the input of even the newest and least experienced individual will receive a decent hearing. Although there are some obnoxious idiots (to use a polite phrase) in management, the majority of the people in lower management are intelligent and competent people with whom it is a pleasure to work. The focus is normally where it should properly be - getting the job done, and done well. As long as the job gets done, and your function is covered during your absence, there is no problem scheduling a dental appointment or visit to the doctor during working hours, or leaving the office early to get to a function at your child's school. There may be occasions when the job happens to necessitate working well beyond 8 hours in a day, but that comes with the territory in this business, and *very* few managers attempt to game the system to obtain 50 hours work for 40 hours pay.","Since about 1990 there has been an increasing emphasis on short-term profit at the expense of long-term stability and growth. Work has been outsourced to companies that lack the capability to deliver satisfactory components or subsystems, but submit extremely low bids. Boeing staff then have to be assigned to clean up the mess so the hardware works and production gets back on schedule. However, upper management fails to learn from experience, and the whole process repeats the next time they look for a supplier, or do a Make-or-Buy decision. This can be very frustrating to observe. Over a period longer than a year or two, a diagram of management assignments above the lower levels would look like a demonstration of Brownian motion in action. Managers spend more time working to obtain their next position than to do their assigned jobs. The general management philosophy seems to be to take some dramatic action that looks impressive and financially spectacular in the short term, and move on to another position elsewhere before it becomes obvious that the Emperor's new clothing is actually very drafty. Promising wonderful things while consciously ignoring reality appears to be the approved road to corporate advancement. Managment guru Peter Drucker created a variety of phrases such as ""Management by Objectives"" to describe various approaches that management can use to effectively perform their functions. On many occasions, the best description of upper and middle management behavior at Boeing is probably a phrase that Drucker never used - ""Management by Wishful Thinking"".

Boeing offers excellent health care, an impressive 401K matching, paid overtime, the best education assistance in the business, and very good job security. The aerospace/defense industry is definitely a niche industry to be in, however not all engineering jobs at Boeing have to do with aerospace. Boeing is definitely a massive company. There's a lot of interesting projects to work on, and some really cool technology to work with. One nice thing about Boeing is the ability to cross over into different careers and get exposure to the rest of the company. You can also work in many different cities which is a nice flexibility. The work history behind most long time Boeing employees is very impressive and interesting due the large amount of technical diversity in the company. Most engineers at Boeing can basically work how the want and dress any way they want. You're not bound to working specific hours, although this isn't always the case in all programs. Working virtual is allowed by some managers, but varies greatly depending on the group you're in. Many managers are very much engaged in fostering the development of their employees. You have annual meeting with you manager to measure your strengths and areas of improvement, and to chart your future goals within the company. If you're highly motivated to excel, your manager will help chart you a path to get where you want.","Well, there's a list actually. 1) The pay at Boeing is usually about 15-20% less than what you could get at Microsoft, Yahoo, or Google. Granted, you are paid for overtime, so at the end of the year you're really paid the same. Unless, of course, you're babysitting some old legacy software and never work an hour of overtime (there are people like that at Boeing). 2) Boeing is not a place to be at if you're trying to climb the corporate ladder quickly. This is an old style, industrial/military-orientated company. Your upward progression in this company will be at a snail pace, unless you're absolutely brilliant and solve world hunger. 3) Promotions and raises are flawed. Because of the Unions at Boeing, you're too protected and normalized with the rest of your peers. For example, there's people who cool their heels on their desk and are absolutely not productive at all and they get a 4% raise. However, if you bust your butt and work really hard, you'll manage to get a 4.5% raise. I swear I've seen many people sleeping at their desk at work. 4) The most irritating thing about Boeing Management is how they are decades behind current industry standards and modern concepts. It's definitely an old-man's company. Most of the engineers you see are gray, balding, and pushing retirement. There's not enough young blood to come in and take over the domain knowledge of the business. As such, there's a complete lack of respect and disregard for the younger talent. Young people coming out of college and grad school with fresh ideas and concepts are basically treated like idiots. Because of this, there's an enormous amount of young employee turnover, because there's better companies out there with a fresher and more vibrant corporate culture. If you can manage to stay at Boeing long enough for these dinosaurs to retire, you'll finally get a chance to bring processes up to the 21st century.",Boeing

I don't know if that's because the company itself is very old or because most of senior management is very old (in their sixties and seventies). But the end result, for the administrative staff, is not good. If you come in to Boeing as an Office Administrator (Boeing's term for an administrative assistant), it's a pretty safe bet that's all you will ever do there.

Sure there are some employees that are great performers, but the majority of employees seem to be content with doing as little as possible. Promotions at Boeing are based exclusively on seniority, and not based on actual performance. This may be what accounts for the laziness as employees know that even if they overachieve, they will not be rewarded for it. The age of the company as a whole is also extremely old with approximately 67% of the company eligible for full retirement benefits within the next 5-10 years.

Other factors include being complacent, we sometimes take too long to get projects completed and the customer is annoyed with us.",Boeing
7175,"""Boeing - Pick Your Poison""",3.0,"The best reasons to work for Boeing involve the nuumber of programs available to the engineering staff. Boeing is so large that an engineer can move to multiple programs at a site, can move to different sites locally, or move across the country and never leave the company. This is good for professional growth and experience. Because Boeing does so many different things (aircraft production, advanced avionics, large scale system integration, advanced weapon systems, satellites, UAVs, etc.) it's easy to get a broad range of experience just by moving around the company. Boeing is also very good about work life balance. In most instances, the 40 hour week is the norm and OT is on a voluntary basis. Also, at Boeing, you get paid for every hour you work. Even though exempt employees are on salery, all overtime is paid at your normal rate +$6.50/hour. Not a great overtime premium to be sure, but there is no working 50 hours a week and only getting paid for 40.","Boeing is a VERY big company. As such, all the problems that come with a big company infect Boeing. Boeing is VERY bureaucratic. Everything is ruled by ""processes"" and there are legions of deadwood employees who do nothing but sit around making up new ones. Then the company runs ""audits"" to make sure everyone is following the ""process"". Obviously no one does, but everyone lies to the auditors so that the reports come out right. This is typical at big companies, but it is systemic at Boeing, infecting every level. There is little chance of Boeing ever changing as they have started ""training"" every manager at what they call ""The Leadership Center"" but the managers call it ""The Plush Prison"". It was described to me by a manager as a very slick version of a communist reeducation camp. From sunup to sundown for a week managers are subjected to intense ""training"". It is intended to make better ""leaders"" but the net effect is to ensure that every manager is a carbon copy. Individual thought and unique approaches are actively discouraged. Sometimes this can make it a very challenging place to work.",Boeing
