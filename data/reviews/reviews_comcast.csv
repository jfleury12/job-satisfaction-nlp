325,"""Temporary Employment Until You Land Your Real Job""",1.0,"Good Benefits, Good Friends, Free Food","The OBSR Job itself. Spend 8 hours a day in an auto-dialer working tired, worn-out, unrefined leads...and sounding like a complete idiot on the majority of these calls while you're waiting for the computer screen to catch up to who you have on the phone. You will call about 100 businesses each day (or more) and most of them hang up on you the instant they hear the word ""Comcast"". Those that don't are likely already Comcast Business customers which shouldn't be in your list in the first place since the OBSR position's focus is NEW ACQUISITION. But...in spite of the company being keenly aware of this problem, they do NOTHING about it other than encourage you to sell whatever lines of business the customer doesn't already have, regardless of whether it's a service that will benefit the business or not. When I say worn out and tired leads, I'm also talking about the fact that the company recycles leads like crazy and changes the name of the list but not the leads in the list. Here's the basic formula for the OBSR department: spend as little on leads as humanly possible and keep constantly hiring more poor suckers to call through them over and over again...then, after the Marketing OBSRs are done with a list, send it over to the Qualified OBSRs and call all those poor souls that didn't get weeded out of the list a few more times. Also, you will call a TON of Home-Based Businesses that are already using Xfinity Residential Service and you're expected to flat out LIE to the customer about how much better Comcast Business service is to justify the much higher price point. The truth is that there are only a few differences between Xfinity and Comcast Business and those are rather minor differences at best. Additionally, Comcast has a TERRIBLE reputation in the industry and in spite of claiming that ""customer service should be our best product"" they are doing very little to back those words up with any sort of action. At least once every couple days you'll call someone the company has burned in the past and that person is going to let you have it. One other thing to be aware of is that the company does not work together. As a telemarketer, you'll fight to keep sales that the door-to-door guys will steal. Other phone jockeys even in your same call center will also try to poach your deals. Many of the technicians will tell your customers all kinds of crazy things to get out of doing their job. Other departments are set up as checks and balances and will reject deals you submit for all kinds of silly bureaucratic reasons...which means your customer has to wait while the company foolishly fights amongst itself. I could go on here all day listing cons...but these things above are the major issues. The bottom line is, if you don't mind making a total fool of yourself through no fault of your own, telling people outright lies in order to get deals, and working for a company that people truly hate...it's not a bad place to work, at least while you keep interviewing at other places where one can take pride in being an employee there. However, if you're any sort of decent salesperson who has ethics, integrity, and any sort of moral compass, you're not going to want to stay there long. Like me, you'll be looking for another job elsewhere where you won't be ashamed to tell people where you work.",Comcast

They pay higher because they have a hard time attracting people to Comcast.,"I was a target of a “workplace bully”. Google it! I was the new person on a small design team. I was enthusiastic and proactive in my daily activities. My team was impressed with my ability to handle many high stakes projects with ease and often I was told as much. I was the guy that the junior level designers came to for tips and tricks. The bully was the designer who had been there the longest and had the most to lose from my rapid growth in hindsight. When it came time to promote said bully I was supportive because I had always been impressed by his competencies. Once he was promoted he began to treat myself and another team member like rivals. The time came for me to lead another high stakes project and this time with a few other team members made up of an junior level designer, the bully and the bully’s intern. Yes, the bully had an intern that he not only hired but enlisted to bully me too. I was very excited for this opportunity to lead a team of designers at Comcast as it was a great growth opportunity. The bully undermined me almost everyday, even going as far as taking my team to another room in the building to generate concepts for my project without inviting me. My boss and the bully were buddies. So when I brought up my concerns my boss didn’t give any importance to my claims. I confronted the bully and tried to clear the air in hopes that we could work better together. I was very diplomatic and felt upon leaving that discussion that progress was made. But the bully later sent me an email on a Sunday without CC’ing my boss saying he was going to remove me from presenting a project and would do the presentation to the executive himself and that I would not be speaking, without any grounds to do so. I immediately forwarded the email to my boss asking for guidance. I really didn’t know what to do, I just wanted this to stop, because I enjoyed my job and wanted to get back to that. There was a study from 2012 that concluded that once you are a target of a workplace bully, you are 77.7% likely to be terminated or quit. Well I was terminated and one of my team members that was bullied too quit shortly after citing the bully as the reason. I was a Senior level Designer and my team member that quit was a Lead level designer. I carried about 40-45% of the teams total work load and the Lead Designer carried about 10-15%. Losing us decreased the capacity of that team to deliver that amount of productivity because of this bully. Before I started there we two other similar level designers on this team and I can only imagine that they may have really left for similar reasons. Comcast you have a problem on that team and it affected two designers, maybe four and potentially will affect future hires.",Comcast

There are plenty of other factors that tie into this metric system. A lot of them are somewhat impossible to avoid. Because of this, it does effect you in both getting a raise and moving up. But if you do your work right and you're not getting repeated at jobs, you'll do fine and you wont have a problem to both move up into another position and make more money....and gain more respect with your fellow techs and supervisor. In addition I do not like how things are always changing almost every week. It seems like were asked to do something new that can make our daily job more irritating. I get it that technology is always adapting, its just annoying that I, and most techs that I work with are always on a roller coaster of being comfortable and not being comfortable.",Comcast

I took advantage of the continued education benefit and am finishing my masters degree now... I also joined a couple of the employee resource groups which offer seminars and networking events that support your professional profile. Listen, I'm not a total nerd. The point of my post is that this isn't a company you join and just stay stale within. They encourage your growth, but it's up to you to make it happen. Not only this - it's pretty exciting. We're busy and we have big jobs to do. My salary is in the top percentile for my industry but not only this, I again get the continued education (which is ~$6K/year) plus free cable/internet, top health care benefits and a truly balanced lifestyle - which is rarely the case within the Tech industry.","Telling people you work at Comcast triggers 2 typical responses: 1) A big hatred rant on customer service 2) A how do I get my foot in the door? The reputation of the company is difficult, but the style of the company is to stay humble - I've never seen the company defend themselves against the harmful and discrediting news that exists. I personally think they should defend themselves a little more - they are between a rock and a hard place in many instances of service. I personally experienced visiting someone's home where the issues they were having with their connection was due to a tree root growing into the cable lines which had been their for over 20 years. Things like that cannot be diagnosed over a phone call. It's hard work in the field for sure. Being a part of the corporate side sometimes we're too disconnected from what's happening on the frontline.

605,"""Sounds good but doesn't fulfill promise - disrespectful""",1.0,"Co-workers - you meet a lot of very nice people, all in the same horrible situation. Free services.","Management and Corporate do not care abut Techs or similar level employees. Company has a conduct policy that only applies to non management workers. management is allowed to treat workers any way they please, up to lying about them to get them fired. Corporate cares less, and the company is always hiring because its always firing people because the Supervisors get rid of people according to crony-ism. When people move up, its because someone likes them - for any reason - rather than whether they qualified for the job or not. I was terminated, but if someone from Corporate decided they liked me today, I would be back working tomorrow. That's how they work on that end. So imagine if they DON'T like you... Their performance evaluation system is flawed, does not take in account sickness, time off, and punishes Techs for things out of their control, such as jobs they were not on or responsible for. The system is designed to just trust whatever a Supervisor says, so whether something is your fault or not, the Supervisor can just leave it on you and nobody will listen to your protest, valid or not. They have a system of appeal, called Comcast Listens. Its also corrupt because they snitch to your direct Supervisors when you report anything. After that, they do not look for the Management's errors or transgressions, the investigator who is supposed to be helping YOU will look for something to attack YOU with, because you are not part of management - you can be fired for reporting to Comcast Listens. They Listen - and then they fire you. knowing that Corporate is lazy and uncaring, Supervisors will just keep writing you up, keep lying on you, until they can just fire you. The training is a joke - but on top of that if you ask them they will warn you about trying to learn more on your own as if it's a violation. Techs are given no time to learn anything anyway, as they are worked to death, in a rush and no care about safety. They do the old ""You have to do all this, we know you have no time to do it... but that's on you to figure out"" game. or example, we were told we are not to do wall wishes anymore, but in an unclear manner. When you try to clarify it with a definitive yes or no, they won't give you that - instead they keep putting in a way that basically says ""The real answer is no - but we want you to just do it anyway AND DONT GET CAUGHT..."". All they care about is numbers. If the Supervisor is incompetent, he starts firing all the new or under performing people on his team. The refuse to change the companies expectations to be more realistic. Most other companies in this industry expect up to 5 jobs per day. (At&amp;T for example - who pays double the salary for half the work). Comcast wants you to do 11 - 15 jobs per day. They trivialize some of the jobs as ""only trouble calls"", but for one, they give you a shortage of ten minutes (20 minutes in an hour) of time to do them, and second, if the trouble call requires more work - which 80% fall in this category - they do not give you more time without punishment. They under time you and then punish you because of their mistake. Then they brow beat you, telling you it's your fault that your team-mates have more work to do, when in fact it is because they are slamming you with too much work and not making adjustments when the work becomes more than they thought it would be. The discipline system is designed to cycle through workers. HR , Management, Corporate - they have nice secure jobs, support and a quality appeal in times of unfairness. But the workers beneath them are fired for TWO UNRELATED OCCURRENCES! TWO??? And as I explained earlier - they don't care how they came about, or who wrote them. I had lies placed in my files, I protested them, they acknowledged them - and then LEFT THEM. Over a half a year later HR calls me in (they don't tell you why until you get there) and terminates me. The issues they wrote me up about were untrue - but despite going all the way up the ladder to Corporate about it, all they did was ask the same people who lied about me for more incidents, and then told me I did these ""other things"" so they are going to let the defamation stand and allow me to stay un-vindicated and unemployed. This is how they work! They rather keep corrupt Supervisors there, wasting money continuously training new hires than get rid of the rats sinking the ship. Oh and one more thing about training. Its barely enough. They rush you through training, and then they throw you out in the field. The Supervisor can pull you out of training and have you do jobs if he feels like it - even if you really don't know anything. They dont care if you get it or not - even the teachers complain how ridiculous the training is. If you speak out about the horrible experiment - which is what their training sessions are - they treat you like you have a learning disability and start working on firing you. They have little meetings about you behind your back so you cannot defend yourself and then come at you with a decision, often misrepresenting you. The real irony here is when they have meetings they ask workers and evry meeting - for YEARS, the workers bring up the ridiculous expectations. Management acknowledges it, offers some BS solutions, says they are working on it - but yet Techs are still getting fired behind it. They will not suspend the broken evaluation system even though they know it is antiquated and does not match up to the changes in the Tech's job. Furthermore, other supporting departments, like Dispatch, are given Carte Blanche to shift issue responsibility on to the Techs - when they mess up the scheduling, which they do every day - the Tech gets punished because they can't perform on time. Management once again lies, saying Dispatch is held responsible - but they never take the blame off of the Tech - no, you SHARE that punishment, even if it's totally not your fault. Comcast is a complete mess, and it's a shame because it doesn't have to be. You want to see why your shares are not performing well? Look at the way they handle the Tech responsibilities - it is bleeding money and it isn't the fault of the Tech - it's the management who could care less about Comcast or the workers. They know it is broken and have given up, so they just let the bad stuff just keep rolling.",Comcast

650,"""Comcast Business: Startup Tone""",4.0,"The best thing about Comcast Business is that sector of the business is relatively new and small compared to the overall Comcast Corporation and more top-of-mind Comcast Xfinity. This means you have the name-recognition, funding, and structure of an established and stable company. Structure means there's organization and hierarchy, if that's your thing. That in turn means the Vice President gets the big big picture vision and meets with directors to share. Directors are told the bigger picture goals, who then pass the overall action item to the managers, who then pass to the individual contributors to figure out together how best to implement...and then you implement. If you don't like the idea of hierarchy or bosses (or the possibility for this structure to lead to micromanaging and political sucking up), this might be tricky. Otherwise, this leads to a well-oiled and effective machine that gets work done. Because the Business sector is so new and small, you also have the 500-or-less employee size feel of a smaller company along with the feeling that you reallly do have the creativity and opportunity to flex outside your job responsibilities and dip into other voluntary projects purely for career growth. If you make the effort, you could theoretically know everyone in your office by sight or name. Senior Leadership is extremely accessible as they are often based out of the office and walking around. Comcast Cares is a good philanthropic initiative.","The problem is, many of the original or longer-tenured employees don't have that career growth or thought leadership mindset to dip outside their jobs. Much of the mindset is ""heads down, I'm going to do the minimal work to secure a paycheck, even if it means doing mediocre work."" This attitude and loose practice of integrity makes the ""customer experience"" push a real dicey one because at the end of the day, many employees are more focused on either making the sales numbers as inflated as possible or about clocking in and clocking out. Leaders are often promoted from within due to the ""who you know"" or ""how long you've been here"" versus true managerial knowledge. If you're faced with a leader who doesn't know what she or he is doing and has no true business being a leader of people and of craft...well, can't do anything about that other than watch that person get promoted again in a few years. The company and the overall industry is older, which means slightly old fashioned business practices and ways of management. Expect to play or hear about politics and who knows whom. Inappropriate behaviors and misconduct surrounding the treatments of race, diversity, and gender is a thing here, probably due to the ""old boys"" culture and nature of it being a more old fashioned industry. Cloud content management and digital tools haven't hit yet, so get used to old fashioned collaboration and file sharing practices. Forget about the tech company benefits you hear about at the Facebooks and Googles of Silicon Valley -- there are no snacks, no flexible work from home options, no unlimited PTO, no fitness reimbursements. If you're a normal human being, you're probably fine without the basketball hoops and free lunches.

People who are irrational in their emotions or demands, people who will pretend they can do their job better than you, hoarders, and so on. Management does not listen. Don't bother filling out surveys, the company plugs their ears and dodges the issues brought up. There is also a very fake atmosphere of faux-positivity that is tiring which ties into the corporate atmosphere. Brainwashing. You should not expect to be able to speak openly or honestly about your experiences, which is sadly the status quo in corporate America. Thankfully you are out in the field 90% of the time to avoid this. You will always be doubted or second-guessed when you bring up a concern about a job. Management has a tendency to insult a Technician's intelligence only to spend an hour of back and forth to come to the same conclusion. Metrics change often and need to be improved on. Other Telecom providers limit a 'Repeat' penalty for callbacks to two weeks. Comcast will penalize you for having another tech return to the same house you were in within a month.

Repeats have gotten worse! Every job whether its a small job where all u gotta do is work on the outside of the home still hurts your peformance if customer calls about something wrong in the inside. Time frames are the dumbest thing! (The customer agents from syria)-act like they are in a special needs group. Cant talk correctly, and they will put anything as the problem in the home, like telling customers you will come there and change all the equiptment for free. (Internet x the customers)- customers will complain because they pay for 400 mbps and they computer is only allowed to pull 200, so now u are there tryna convince a customer that they computer is the problem, it will clearly result in a Repeat, and its nothing you can do about it. (Raise)-You will never get a raise now with these new metrics they rolled out, they made its twice as hard now to move up, and its still just as long. Moving up takes 6 months to do, no matter how good you are or how much experience or awards you get. You will be in one title for years here, so if u com tech 2, get prepared to be that way for 2 years i guarantee it. (Vans)- you will drive the oldest vans ever, some of these vans were created when i was 8 years old and im 22 now so you do the math, it will be roaches in the vans. And you will break down a couple times as well. (Everybody is off at 6:30)-no matter what, jobs stop rolling normally around 5:50 but comcast wont let you sit and wait til 6:30, they will give you some crappy job to do at 6:10 or 6:15 right before its time to go home, and it will probably be a job where u gotta pull your ladder out and climb a pole.

We used to be able to no access a job if you cannot get into a yard to work on it, now they took that away and you have to just take a repeat if you cannot get back there. (Pht)- you cant even close your job because of this feature called pht, its a home check and it looks at everything, i mean everything, even things you cant even work on, so if you try to close your job and it has a red x on it, be prepared to spend another hour trying to fix a problem thats not even customer related. Most of the time it fails because of the network team yet you still gotta find a way to fix everything, aka your taking the blame! (Network team)- god forbid you have to call them to verify its an issue on there side, they will grill you, talk to you with no respect tell you that its your fault and make you do extra things just to prove to them that its not something you can fix. (Bonuses)-after like 4 months you get this taxed bonus check that is given to you based on how you peformed in a quarter, its also based on the whole office peformance, so if the office did bad, guess what!

Leadership can seem detached from the necessary day-to-day in terms of end results on a couple of fronts. First, you have a disconnect of resources and focus - a lot of resources all seemingly running in different directions rather than being a little more aligned. It's a typical symptom of larger companies, but always felt to be a little more disorganized within the DCOE than elsewhere. The second piece is that translates to brute forcing projects. While work life balance is definitely strong, that doesn't mean within work hours things can't routinely get stressful when ""war rooms"" are called on a frequent basis to chase something. Comcast, as an employer, has the scale to be inefficient like this, but more organized organizations would have a better way to be ahead of things rather than most random things turn into a fire.

1094,"""Technician""",4.0,"With the exception of a few techs which it doesn't matter where you go you'll run into those types in some fashion Comcast is a company that provides more benefits and tools to help it's employees in so many different aspects of not just work but home life as well at no cost. From financial advisors to serious discounts on Automobile purchases and insurance not to mention a nice 401k match and stock purchase program that gives employees stock at the lowest price for that quarter and a 15% discount on top which is accessible yearly. Employees basically receive TV, Internet and telephone for almost nothing. Roughly $300 services will run around $50-60 monthly. You're given Roughly 64 hrs in flex time, 3 float holidays and over a weeks vacation time after your 90 days. They allow 6 call outs before a general counsel is given that a verbal is next, written, final etc. Call outs are 1-2 days on 3rd a note is needed. Doing your job correctly and having good numbers will go further than any amount of favoritism as I've seen posted. You're supervisor will work with you through anything as long as you are keeping up your end. As far as tools not being provided, Comcast gives you everything you need including $300 Red wing boots yearly, $800 for uniform purchases and you're responsible for ordering everything else that you will go through daily. You'll also receive a new iPhone and tablet for work. I'm closing, you will take away from the basically 6 months of paid training what you put into it and your work ethic will determine your daily experience. Some days are beyond control but they're few and far. They also just added maternity leave for men up to 3 months I believe.","Rules vary from garage to garage like home garage. Currently I believe Amazon drivers make more than a technician who’s been employed for over 10yrs. Closest competitors Technicians make more than double of that 10+ year tech after 5yrs less if hired with experience. I've seen a lot of other negative things about training, tools and support. I find those statements to be as far from the truth as possible and most likely made by people working as sub contractors for Comcast like ""Aero communications Inc "". You do however have to consider the free services and benefits and what they might add to your check which is bi-weekly, I'm not a fan of that but that's more preference than con. If you for some reason don't have direct deposit you'll receive a pay card that will get loaded every pay. Doesn't bother me personally but most days it's tough to take a lunch or you might be scheduled for lunch at 9:45am. Not making an appointment on time is a big deal so if you're stuck on a job speak up as soon as possible. It's frustrating but once you work out a system and don't cry wolf every day it calms down.",Comcast

The job is very tough to stay in, but if you do, you will get excellent sales experience. co-workers are generally real cool. Company culture encourages each sales rep to associate and share techniques, which most will actually do.","Company culture is pretty negative. The longer you stay with this company, the more you will see they treat their customers horribly. Eventually, you will come to realize they their employees pretty similarly. So much of the initial training is to brainwash employees into not listening to all the negative comments they may have heard. Over time, an employee will come to realize the bad reputation is well deserved. An elite salesman does not depend on price to sell their product. But most people are not elites. Having reasonable prices to offer customers does help.

In the time that i was there in my opinion the corporate side was allowed to much say as to what happens in the field and it only ever got worse. When i started as a tech uniform was pants, such as, jeans with no hole, khakis, etc. as longs the were presentable and a company logo'd polo. which provided to us were at the time red, gray or black. Occasionally due to incentives for work progress and such the gave out different colored ones that stood for different things. by the time i was gone company policy, not only took away any and all incentives or awards recognition programs set in place but also changed uniform policy to a strict company provided khakis and company provided black polo. Which is obviously a decision that was made by a paper pusher who had never been in the field before or been in the sun in the midsummer with a black polo or up a pole on a ladder in tight khakis. just one example of the many things changed before i left",Comcast

Depending on the org/manager you are under, you’ll be working 40 hours max per week and can enjoy your life after work and the weekends to do what you want. Working from home is also okay once or twice a week which is great! - Benefits and perks are great. Insurance is top notch and out-of-pocket is quite low. 401(k) matching is 6% which is amazing. Cable/internet/home security is heavily discounted and pretty much free - Working with some of the brightest minds. Comcast tries it’s best to get some of the best engineers out there and it does show. Some of the people I work with have great ideas and can solve pretty much any problem. It’s great as an engineer still young in my career to take bits and pieces from how these people solve problems and make it my own. - Great working conditions (in the Philadelphia campus at least). I love working at the Comcast Center (and moving to the Comcast Technology Center soon). Working in the tallest buildings in the city and getting the amazing views is pretty breathtaking and is a nice distraction when you want a break from your work. There’s also a nice cafeteria that has a lot of options albeit quite expensive. - Comcast is quickly becoming a top-tier technology company that’s developing and using some of the latest trends in tech. Comcast encourages their employees to try to incorporate new tools or develop a piece of software if it doesn’t already exist. - Even though people are starting to cut cable, Comcast has shifted it’s focus to internet and home automation/IoT and other spaces. This is a great move to continue to be a major tech player for years to come as cable television starts to die out.","- Stigma working at Comcast. Many people outside of the company still view Comcast as an evil telecom corporation. Telling people I work here can sometimes start a long conversation on how much they hate Comcast. - A bit lower salary than other top tier tech companies. Even though Philadelphia cost of living is way lower than Silicon Valley/San Francisco, I wish Comcast paid a bit more base salary, but it’s not that bad. - A lot of contractors. Even though many contractors are amazing and super intelligent, a lot of them come in and leave and there is a constant rotation. This can leave gaps in knowledge. I wish Comcast converted more people to FTE that really earned it. - Promotions can take a long time depending on the org. Some orgs promote their top performing employees super quickly, others let their employees stagnate in the same role they’re in for years. - Things move SUPER slow at times due to how large the company is. To get a firewall request done could take up to a week which can be a little bit frustrating. Getting a new employee (especially contractors) set up with their laptop, desk, etc can sometimes take weeks after they start which is just ridiculous. - A lot of reorgs. Recently there has been some shift in upper management (in the Digital Home org) which has led to some changes downstream. This has worried some of the engineers if their team will continue to be around due to the shuffling.",Comcast

And they expect you to do all of this for just a couple of dollars over minimum wage while telling you they pay way more than the rest of the job market which is a lie. Programs and APPs to do you're day to day job go down daily making incredibly difficult to do your job. Sales staff steal commisions from technicians as well as making promises technicians can't keep that's if they just don't flat out lie to customers. Comcast says technicians are the most important part of the company but every other sales position or call center position has a higher starting wage and the metrics aren't nearly as difficult to make.

Weight room is a good outlet for frustration.,"Worker-Hostile: Orientation over two days (yes, two!) includes separate anti-union segments, including how some linemen in Maryland don't get discounted cable at home because they didn't include that in their negotiations. Orientation also worships Grandpa Roberts, the benevolent businessman. There is a rule that you must work there for one year before getting any sort of promotion, even if you have prior call center experience. Harsh 90 day no-tolerance policy for lateness, or even planned-in-advance absence. Saw a veteran who needed services from the VA get a ""verbal written warning"" which he was not allowed to keep a copy of, but would be counted as a strike against him towards a termination. He left before that happened, because the policy is so worker-hostile. The VA is only open government hours. Junior management took special pleasure in writing me up for being under three minutes late. Poor Training: It's clear the training program assumes high turnover, and so rushes to get value out of you. Training is the equivalent of having your skull opened and a jumble of information dropped onto it. Then stirred. It's too much at once. There is no use-what-you-learned live training, so you learn about three or four weeks of material then get dropped into taking live calls. They do not give you a limited area first to master, though this would be trivial with their ACD phone system. Cable TV troubleshooting is the easiest, but they don't let you do just that for a few days. General: Most of the support issues are around billing. Even the ""new and improved"" billing is every bit as convoluted as it has been. Multiply that by multiple billing systems for different regions. Their phone service is not mature. Most of the fixes involve power cycling the phone ""modem"". It's an open secret that they must staff to certain levels to keep the FCC happy. Location: The Hudson NH location is at the dead-end of a warehouse district, so there's no good food options nearby. The in-house cafeteria isn't great, but is priced higher than wages should allow.

There's a constant fear of losing your job at all levels. The supervisors, for the most part, only care about metrics. They make money off of you making money. My observation showed no ""open door"" policy despite what they may tell you. Don't ever let anyone know if you called the ""Listens Line"" to report something. Whatever you do, I cannot stress this enough, do not ever go to HR for anything; just don't.

I literally (possessed a higher degree bachelor's from a major US university than the majority of supervisors) and applied for numerous internal advanced positions related to my degree. After 3 years in this role I didn't receive one interview despite stellar reviews and metrics from supervisors/managers. It's almost like the call center is where you go to stay and they don't look at those who deal with front-line customers as anything but.

All Comcast cares about is money and if you have an issue, don't bother bringing it up because supervisors and management are trained to only talk positive about something that is not. Metrics are placed to make it impossible to get promoted. They say they care about military, they do not. I've been talked down on every time I get called out on orders. When I am gone, my numbers still count against me. It's impossible for someone in the military to get a raise when they are not here making the already impossible productivity to rework metrics. Overtime is forced on employees. Supervisors do not care nor help when really needed. Pay is awful for the type of work we do. I've been here for 3 years and still make the same as when I started. Customers yell at us even though it's not our fault the company lies to them, climb up sketchy poles and have to work in some of the most filthy cockroach infested houses for a merely 15 an hour. Insurance is expensive so it's like you get paid minimum wage, and the vehicles given to us are falling apart, but because Comcast only cares about saving money, deal with it. They get on your about productivity, but it's impossible when you have to sit and wait for a modem to boot up for 30 minutes or longer, then you have to wait for a pht test another 40 minutes for hopefully the devices to pass. If something doesn't pass, you're there even longer to figure out why and getting a phone call from the supervisor asking what's taking so long. You can't make your next job, too bad, they have no other tech to give it to and your getting a late which also affects your numbers. Oh and after every job, the customer gets a call to take a survey about how you did it how they feel about the company... They hit the wrong number or you don't get perfect 5's or 10's, don't even think about getting promoted for the rest of the year. This company is a joke and like I said, all they care about is money. They make you take a survey every month and scare you into giving great scores because it affects the supervisors, and if anyone does say anything negative, they don't bring it up. Not to mention that equipment never works. After waiting 30+ minutes for something to boot up, cross your fingers it works because you may have to go through another 30+ minutes after swapping out the first piece of equipment.

The medical bene's are good and a huge reason why I stick with the company. 401K 6% match is nice. And a good employee stock program. Free tickets to Universal is mute for me, I don't live near there nor will i pay a plane ticket to go there. Time off benefits are nice, you start with 80 hrs. of vacation and 40 hours of flex, plus 3 floating holidays. When you hit your 5th year, you get an extra 20 hours of vacation. But then sadly no more ever again.","My original job with Comcast was outsourced, and my and many other people's positions were eliminated. We were told we had 1 year to get back into the company and still maintain our standing with the company. My last day was august 17th 2017, and i was hired back in on October 15th 2017. My medical benefits did not automatically turn back on like i was told by HR they should. I spent 3 months being ignored by HRSS on getting my medical benefits reinstated. Big mess up on them having me in the system as a ""new hire"" which wasn't the case. The fact i was ignored for 3 months was the biggest of that issue. It was December 29th when they finally contacted me to tell me they messed up. I had been contacting them weekly since being rehired. I also expected the yearly merit raise when March 2018 rolled around, based on the 10 months I worked in 2017. But found out that because I was forcedly ""displaced"" for 8 weeks, it made me ineligible for a raise. How convenient for Comcast. This makes me furious, disappointed, discouraged, feeling unvalued and financially struggling currently with the lack of over time options at my new job and a $210/mo. rent hike. * Shame on you Comcast. I worked my butt off for 10/12 months in 2017, I worked harder than many, and I cared more than most. I'm one of the great employees this company prides itself on having, and they use a lousy loop whole to not honor my yearly raise? I did not LEAVE, I was forced out so they could save $$ by sending the jobs to another company who’ll do it cheaper. I'll be honest, that alone makes me care a whole lot less, and why should I care for a company that doesn't care for me? Their excuse was ""you were not with the company for those 8 weeks. My counter was ""but what about the 8 months leading up to that? That effort should have been acknowledged. And the 2 months after it when I re-hired? None of that is counted? My 8 months of back breaking labor doesn't matter to them. And their excuse for the 2 months after was ""new hires that start in October are not eligible for a merit raise"" ... Yes, I am aware of this. It is true because they are within a 90 day new hire trial period, so no they wouldn't get a merit raise for that calendar year. BUT I'M NOT A NEW HIRE! I’m a rehire, and I did work during the calendar year and I was NOT in a 90 trial period. How convenient you relabeled me just in this regard so as to not have to give me my well DESERVED and most certainly earned raise. Screwed me over is what you did. I'm sure all your employees with poor work ethic still got their raise. I owe the company at least 10 months of lack of effort, but it’s not my way, I just have too good of work ethic. I just need to be with a company that truly honors that and wants to retain the good employees. My raises have been anywhere from 4%-6.5%, (5% being the max we were told) I’m really that great of a worker. My entire management team gave me glowing letters of recommendation because they wanted to make sure the company retained me. And then the company slaps me in the face, again. What would a lousy minimum 2% for me have cost them really? I would have taken that over nothing. SHAME SHAME SHAME on Comcast. They offer poor chiropractic care in their medical package. Comcast is filled with people doing heavy lifting, bending, twisting, back hurting jobs, whether a tech, a warehouse employee, or someone sitting at a desk for 8 hours, real chiro care would be great but sadly we only get 12 visits. If you are unlucky enough to have to use any of those visits before you hit deductible you'll be paying about $45 a visit, and then after you use up 12.. You’ll be paying $45 a visit… So try to hit deductible before you need chiro-care. Another con is, sometimes management doesn't want to deal with, handle, manage, the troublemaker employees. Maybe they are scared to? But sometimes some management will make a martyr out of a good employee because they don't want to reprimand a bad one. It's sad, I’ve seen it a lot unfortunately. In the office setting there is a very cliché ""clique"" scene. I came from warehouse, and get some grief for having not been with in this building before getting hired in this position. As if I am any less capable of doing this job. And honestly, I do it better already than some of the old timers here who have gotten to the point of laziness and lack of care. After your 5th year you will not receive any more extra vacation time. Sad, I know lots of people who've been here for 20 years and get nothing for it, not even a real raise because they are ""capped"" I think they get a onetime bonus each year for time served. Speaking bonuses, they gave us all $1000 bonus after they got a HUGE tax break from Trump. That bonus was taxed so hard, that the government still got theirs, and Comcast got to save on theirs, and i didn't get a raise, and that lousy $450 bucks was pointless and did NOTHING to help the employees or the economy in which we live. Thanks for nothing on that front. Didn't even cover half of rent. Most of the places won't let you use your flex time as needed. It's your time and you get punished constantly for having to use it, Vacation should be scheduled, Flex should be able to use freely *within reason*. We fought for that at the warehouse and got it but now my new position is a big NOPE. All my work is finished for the day, even if there is plenty of coverage and we're all twiddling our thumbs, if you have to leave early, you're getting punished. Forget to log into the phone after lunch, get punished. Come in 3 minutes late, punished. I could have just gone to Tim Hortons, grabbed breakfast, been 2.5 hours late, and had the same punishment. I'll remember that next time if traffic is stupid and I’m not going to make it within that 1 minute 59 second grace period. It doesn't matter if you work through my breaks, I stay late if its needed, go above and beyond, get all of your work done, help others theirs done, you get punished right and left for using flex time, OUR TIME, without a 24 hour notice. Heck, I came into work and at 9am I asked to take the next day off because something came up last minute, (my shift starts at 8:30 mind you) the 23.5 hour notice wasn't a 24 hour notice.. I got punished. I needed to take a weekend off, but felt bad because of the already light coverage and didn't want the other ladies to be swamped, so I chose to come in for a couple hours anyways to help out. Had an issue in the morning, got there late, stayed later to make sure all the things were done, and got punished. Next time I’ll just take the whole day and not try to be nice. It only bit me in the behind in the long run. This is definitely getting old. I'm giving Career Opportunities a 1 star, because you could be perfectly qualified for a job and get denied without reason, and then the job will go back up on the board as open. Come to find out, I have been told multiple times “we don’t hire outside the building, you are a rare case” Why don’t you hire outside the building? Is this how all the establishments with in Comcast operate? How do we move up if all you see is Warehouse, or Driver and immediately assume we’re too stupid or unskilled. I’ve seen it happen too many, they get stuck in these entry level positions and it actually HURTS them. You think you are getting a foot in the door, but really you are getting stuck in the room. The ONLY reason I was even considered was because of being a great employee, and the right connection seeing it firsthand put a word in for me. They have this mentality of “if you didn’t start in this office there’s no way you could do this job”. Let’s be clear, this job is EASY. At least for myself it is, I see people who’ve been here for 20 years struggle with concepts or not catch on as fast to new content as I have. I have BFA, I am computer/tech savvy, I can learn any new software or program within a week or 2. I have common sense, and logic. I have experience in this kind of work. I’m smart, motivated, self-managed, and a shining example of good work ethic. But I was almost not even given the time of day because I wasn’t with in this building?

I was told by a recruiter that based on my education, my base pay would be a bit higher. A whopping 75 cents higher. Considering all the call center reps deal with, the long hours and the pathetic attendance policy, you’d think they would at least pay their employees a minimum of $18/hr to start. They’re a well known company, I think you can afford to pay your employees better than that. They try to sucker you in with the idea of “monthly incentives” and “sales goals” to help raise your pay, but it’s the most minuscule amount they could possibly give you. Also, you receive an annual bonus. But don’t expect to see that bonus if you have 1 unexcused absence. *Attendance policy is unrealistic - if you miss 10 minutes-50% of your shift you receive .5 UAP (unexcused absence). If you miss 51%-100% of your shift you receive 1 UAP. 3 UAPs total and you are fired (if you don’t have any vacation/flex/float time). It’s unrealistic to hold employees to this standard. Life happens, and this company needs to be aware of that. *Hours are ridiculous - You can either work 5 8 hours shifts or 4 10 hour shift. Saturdays are mandatory no matter what you choose. A call center should be open during regular business hours. There’s no need to be open past 5:00 pm, let alone on a Saturday. *Training is extensive and over the top - They put you through 6 weeks of training that consists of videos, readings, quizzes and practicing calls. Which doesn’t help you retain any information at all. It’s basically like you’re in school for 8 hours a day. They throw all of this information at you and expect you to remember every last detail about all of their services. Then have the nerve to tell you, “don’t get used to it because these will probably change in 6 months.” *Leaders give you the run around when it comes to asking for help - Asked a trainer a question regarding benefits information, she told me to reach out to a supervisor. So, I asked two of the supervisors (via email) for help. Both ignored me. Tried again with supervisor A and she told me to ask a peer to help me. You are a supervisor, YOU are the one who is supposed to help me. I reached out to supervisor B, and she finally assisted me.

There are customers that will flat out refuse to add video service and will refuse your sales pitch no matter how much you explain about the benefits, tie it to their needs, explain the features, etc but Comcast will keep pushing you to make people get video to meet the 75% minimum video attachment rate if you want to pass your scorecard and not get written up or fired. - Supervisors and Managers will constantly be pushing you to sell triple play packages and quad play packages to customers who may only want 1-2 services. - Not all the calls you receive are sales calls, only about 10% of the calls you receive are actual sales calls and the rest are people who dialed the wrong extention or just dialed any extension in the automated system to get to a live person when they were trying to reach a department like billing, tech support, or the disconnections department but here they are speaking to the sales department and each call you receive that you dont sell anything lowers your attachment rate (even if its not a sales call) so good luck making that 40% general attachment rate to pass scorecard. - Alot of people will call in just to ask for information about promotions or prices but have no intention of buying anything on the call and if you try to close the sale with them they will say things like ""I have to talk to my spouse before making a decision"", you offer to call their spouse and they will say that their not available, you offer to call them back at a later time and they wont pick up their phone at the time they agreed for you to call them back 99% of the time. - On top of the attachment rate goals there are also other metrics you have to meet to pass scorecard like revenue per call, total revenue sold, amount of security systems sold (need 2 minimum monthly to pass), Quality Analysts score (how good you follow a script), and their talking about adding more things to the scorecard as well. - If your not meeting your sales goals you will be constantly harassed every day you come into work by your supervisor and their manager asking what your doing to improve your numbers, trying to get you to compete against other agents, hinting that if you dont improve your sales you may be written up, put on a performance improvement plan that prevents you from switching to another department that might be a better fit for you, and letting you know every day that being on a performance improvement plan is 1 step away from getting fired, etc. - The Comcast commercials are deceptive because they advertise that you can get $19.99 internet but its really $24.99 and you receive a $5 discount if you sign up for automatic payments and bills via email if not you pay $24.99 and Comcast advertises that it ""comes with 5 lines of mobile already included"" but each mobile line is $45 a month for unlimited data or $12 per each GB of data (which is said in the small letters in the commercial that people dont read). - You have to constantly follow up on your orders to make sure nobody cancelled your sales order and re-entered it with their sales id because you only have 3 days to dispute it after the installation completes if not the person who stole your sale gets the credit for it. - 90 day chargebacks on your sales if the customer disconnects for any reason even if their moving to a new location within 90 days or if they installed in one address and then changed their apartment number or address within 90 days. - Sales department works all holidays - The script you have to follow is constantly changing and the Quality Analysts deduct points for petty things and knit pick your calls so that nobody has a perfect score. - The company is always changing and restructuring, I used to work in National Bilingual Retention for several years and then one day all of a sudden the company director comes in and tells everyone in the call center to go to a room for a meeting to make an announcement and they tell us that Spanish Retention is getting outsourced to Mexico, English Retention is going to be based out of Jacksonville, FL and the Philippines, and that our call center is getting converted to Regional Spanish only Sales which I thought wasnt so bad at first because I wouldnt have to deal with irate customers anymore from Bilingual Retention until I actually started working in Spanish only Sales and saw all the unrealistic sales goals they have to pass the scorecard and all the things agents have to deal with to make the company happy. - Commission isnt what it used to be, I used to make better money working in National Bilingual Retention than I do now working as a Regional Spanish only Sales agent. - Lack of positions to move to, I tried seeing if maybe there was another department that I could transfer to since im not happy in Spanish only sales but the company barely posts job openings for internal employees that want to switch departments, they would rather hire new people from outside to fill positions. - Comcast used to raffle out big prizes for selling like 50+ inch LED TV's, Xbox, Playstation, ipads, etc but that all stopped once our center became Spanish only Sales.",Comcast

Depending on the team you're on, you can get quite a different job experience. Comcast is still run as a mainly financials driven company despite their outward appearance as a new-age tech company. As such, some newer types of management styles and work culture norms (think Silicon Valley) may be frowned upon. This is hugely dependant on the team you're on. If you're more business facing, expect to get an old school approach on culture and management. If you're more IT, expect a more laid-back approach. At the department that I work at, certain higher up leadership monitor what time people come into work and leave the office. I think that is a huge mistake. Besides this, helicopter management or micromanaging is rampant in EBI. Good work gets done in EBI but it is lost in the political catfighting and power grabbing that's occurring.

From a sales and support stand point Comcast is entirely focused on getting the numbers, making the sale! As a sales employee you have no protected territory, massive internal competition, and very little support. The base pay is very low and the quota is very high. This leads to a very aggressively competitive and stressful environment. Sales teams are structured so that senior reps have full access to all territories and are encouraged through policy to hoard lead ownership.

Comcast were expected to be at work. We were later released around noon but by that time there was about 2 feet of snow.

2173,"""Great learning experience, in a negative sense.""",2.0,"Benefits are good, income potential good with uncapped bonus potential. Good hours with shift options.","1) training was a night mare. Not because the the knowledge base was not there but the changed where they were going to place us, not once but 3 times in the 2 week training period. Some of the possible options I had no experience in but that didn't seem to matter. In the end it came full circle to the orginal area we interviewed for, all that stress and confession for nothing. 2) transition was unorganized when walked to the floor still not knowing who our supervisor was, no one even knew where we where expected to sit. When finnally sat several times it was decided that it was a mistake. This went in for the entire week. Some of us left behind if the team was moved on their day off, finding no where to sit upon their return. This lead to us spread out randomly throughout the floor, not getting the help or attention needed as a new hire. This continued untill our supervisor was decided and moved to our finnal team. 3) management and employees have a huge disconnect supervisor teach change in service to wow the customer, to better their reputation. Their rating is in the negative below zero rating among customers, they hired an outside company with a multi year plan to change it, spending millions in training, marketing, and branding. I give them major props for this and there are some success and changes being made. Employees voice is being heard on some levels with positive results. But supervisors don't hold themselves to what they teach, example- the policy told to employees is if customers asks to speak to your manager to tell customer it will be 24-48 hrs for a return call. You then email the info to your supervisor. It's common knowledge if asked supvisors do not return customers calls. That customer will call in again and justifiedly so very upset and angry. Even more frustrating is when the agent gets scored by customer in s survey they get marked down for something prior out of their control. In a defense supervisors appear very over worked, always off floor away from their teams in meetings. They have no assistance with time consuming tasks that are not sensitive in nature, other call centers I worked have a team lead to do these tasks and assist with coaching, and driving the team. The supervisors need the tools to manage their time better, and get on board with what they teach to better the company. 4) supervisors are not in touch with how to handle HR issues or proper technical conversation of OSHA privacy. What can and can not be said or asked. I have experience myself or seen. A supervisor tell an employee that the supervisor had a family member who is a nurse, they said the illness was not serious. Not sure why they needed leave. I employee returning from leave without a activated badge or system access, the supervisor told employee that those were not his job, proceeded to do nothing to assist. Seen myself many employees and I myself have experienced problems with Sidwyck, the company who handles many of our leave benefits. They are flat a horrid company making many mistakes, then will deny you for their mistakes. Lost faxes , changed policies midway, short time frames even with their mistakes. It seems they are hired to protect Comcast bottom line, not as a benefit. Comcast to my knowledge has never investigated the claims or even questioned why employee's have so many problem. Supervisors do nothing to assist. Many employees seem to get lost and either quit or get fired on a tectinal issue I believe probably no fault of theirs, either way they are gone. I was once coached once just weeks out of training the entire session was spent showing me how much money I cost the supervisor pay check. If I had performed at the same level as the rest of team he would of made $x.xx but I dropped him to $x.xx . Then proceeded to explain how had he could get me fired. To forget HR and time lines. He would write me up everyday 1-2-3 strikes your out, gone in a week. He gave me a month, but in two weeks I was moved to another floor and department. He told me he was doing me a favor. Sups would talk loud in front of employee how they wish they could trade you for another... Very toxic enviroment at times.",Comcast

Our “training” for this new department consisted of one one-hour meeting of about 100 sales reps. As you can imagine, very little of what we were actually going to be doing was conveyed. The new department started in December when all of management was out on holiday vacation, so for the first month, we had no support from anyone in management. Poor execution. All of this created a hostile working environment in which you got chewed out on a daily basis by management and customers alike.

2553,"""Horrible Experience as a newer employee""",1.0,3 days off Learning / training Benefits Almost free employee services Veteran friendly,"- Does not honor promise of location close to home even when it is possible. Makes it difficult to change this situation even when it is obviously burdensome to employees. - Acts like they are promoting a fair and friendly workplace during the hiring process, but treats you like you are a grunt in the army after they hire you. There is no real management structure and anyone with a position can tell you what to do with little or no repercussions. The bad part of them hiring veterans is Comcasts encourages them to continue like they are in the military, treating employees as if they should have no life whatsoever, except what they are told to do. - Deceiving promotion of ""life to work balance"" and available overtime. What they don't tell you is you will be forced to do overtime whenever they feel like it. That overtime is not by CHOICE, it is by force - and therefore is not a ""benefit"", but they promote it as if it is. - Pay is cheap, especially for the work that is required of you, and the pay raises are minuscule at best. They call you a tech, but pay you peanuts and want you to thank them for it. - They promote employee fairness on one hand, but on the other treat certain classes like they aren't included. CommTechs, for example are routinely scapegoated, slammed with too many assignments, treated and disrespected by managers as their leisure. Nobody listens to them even though they are the people on the scene and their work process is constantly being overstuffed with anyone's ""ideas"", detrimental or not without any form of compensation or time relief. For the lower classes of workers there is no employee empowerment, despite Comcast edicts that constantly speak of it as if there is. Employees are weak and abuse is rampant. -Management is not required to know the skills of the people they are managing, creating a ""personality"" atmosphere where an employee gets by by learning how to appease an incompetent boss. There is also a lot of abuse and upper management doesn't seem to be concerned. -Insane work pace (which includes an undisclosed requirement to spend hours after your ""official"" work time). A system where those who are assigning jobs can abuse the ones who are working them - for example sending you to a job 60 miles away from the last one; or sending you to a job that will take 4-5 hours at the last hour of your shift (and Comcast forces you to do it, although they could either send someone else or find a solution that wouldn't negatively impact employees). They send Techs to two jobs per hour, and if you finish them they expect you to ask for more - like a monkey on a string. Note that just activating a new modem or box can take 20 minutes or more! You can cancel a job - but Comcast punishes you by de-marking you in their abusive metric system, that punishes people more the lower their job title is in the company. -Metric system - yes, their metric system is nothing more than a punishment device. What happens is you are given an impossible task, and if you cannot complete it a certain way you get negative points, which can negatively affect your measly salary. (Note that AT&T pays almost twice as much for the same position - despite having their own issues). Your process is constantly getting ""updated"", added to and delays to your strategy are added, with no adjustment to this system whatsoever. They act as though adding an hour extra to your hourly workload has no impact... which leads us to: - Employees cutting corners. Employees do not follow safety regulations. Not at all. Not even a little bit. The company doesn't actually help them either, unless you call Supervisors who know nothing showing up and yelling at you because your little cone isn't out ""helping""... Your equipment broke? Wait... wait... wait some more. Maybe there is a used belt somewhere they can find for you. Employees are supposed to be trained in safety and several disciplines - but their training is not taken seriously. They rush people through it and throw them in the field. They do not help the employee get experience but ASSUME they do. They set you up with a regular employee for a few weeks and ASSUME they are teaching you - but those workers are either not interested, under-skilled or could care less about you learning anything. The other assumption is that since these people are out in the field (slave terminology?) that they will run into all of the jobs they need to learn what they are required to learn - WRONG AGAIN. The training is handled like a lottery, betting on trainees getting every type of job they need to learn - but in actuality since there is no program when a trainee is in the field, you just become some Tech's side-kick, and there is no guarantee your needed assignment will ever come up. Guess who gets the blame for that? THE TRAINEE. You should have ""asked"" your trainer to teach you something that you have no idea that you should have know... its your fault, because you know - you helped put the training program together...So after the training phase is over your out in the field trying to figure it out by yourself, which is why so many Techs are breaking every OSHA regulation and risking their lives every day. When these employees are called out, it becomes ""Their fault"", management takes no responsibility for creating an abusive working atmosphere that breeds this kind of response. Over half of the jobs are repeats, but management doesn't seem to learn that crushing people in an unreasonable work pace, under threat of discipline is not efficient. It makes people rush through a job and make it ""look"" like it is done - just for the metrics. he fact is, when a tech knows that their shift is about over, they try like hell to not get stuck with one of those forced overtime situations - and who can blame them? - Wasted resources in a worker resource that nobody cares about, and has possible leaks. They tell you about this way to improve the company - go to comcastnow.com and submit an ""anonymous"" report. Next thing you know your getting some kind of punishment. It would be nice if they took it seriously , but employees are mostly afraid to say anything because they do not trust it. - Forced waiting periods in the promotion or lateral movement. They act like your locked in after you get hired. No matter how talented you are they tell you to wait for a year (or 6 months, or 3 months depending on who you ask) before you can move to another position. Say you want to work in Comcast Business - if you didn't get directly hired in that position in the first place you will have to wait a year - for no reason whatsoever. They will say they want you to have ""experience"" in another position - but if that's the case why does someone else walk off the street and get that position? Also, Supervisors can stop you from being promoted with little or no reason - like whether they like you personally or not. - Management has the attitude that people who haven't been promoted must not want to. It isn't like they ask people, they just assume that is the case and just leave people to burn. They even say this fondly as if those people are happy scratching out cheap pay and getting blamed for all Comcast's problems. The also act like new hires are getting some kind of welfare, as if they should all kiss Comcast's backside because Comcast is doing all this for them. Forget about qualifying with a resume, experience and evaluations - you just rolled up off the street and Comcast ""gave you"" this welfare benefit.",Comcast

Systems used by employees are outdated and poorly designed. The company is outsourcing much of their jobs as long as they are not customer facing. The only thing keeping this company afloat is their non-competition footprint where other cable providers agree not to offer competing services. If a fiber provider moves into their internet service area, they will lose their internet service customers because they cannot compete with a fiber offering. If a company develops an internet video package with comparable channel offerings, I believe that Comcast will fold. The company's internal communications are very disorganized. It is nearly impossible for customer support staff to contact dispatch to get any information on the status of field technicians, or contact the NOC to escalate network issues. Annual wage increases are so low that any significant increase in income requires promotion. Management makes little to no effort to promote their employees. The company gave no notice prior to laying off my team and my position was posted on their job board under a different management region (to avoid being sued) the same day.

Also, as of late, they are holding us to numbers that don't even begin to quantify my success as a representative (i.e. if a customer calls in to cancel, the first rep cancels it and then they call back to see where to return the equipment, the first and second rep who get that call take the hit for the cancellation).

I attempted to leave the field blank but was forced to input something.","My 16+ year experience at Comcast is bittersweet. I had such high-hopes at the beginning, expecting this to be a company which would want to develop, grow and empower its employees to reach their individual potentials. Sadly, this is not the case. There is no mentoring and there are no career paths. Management does not recognize the talents and gifting of its employees so they are rarely utilized. Everyone sitting in cubicles is under-utilized talent who are capable of so much more, but management is uninterested in encouraging personal development. As for the corporate culture, this took a drastic turn after the purchase of NBC Universal. Prior to purchasing NBCU, there are a fair amount of autonomy at individual locations and business practices had some flexibility to better serve the needs of customers. After purchasing NBCU, Comcast became overtly political and is now a company dominated by cultural relevance. Business practices are now top-down, one-size-fits all. The problem is, NOTHING is one-size-fits all and the customers suffer because of this. As an employee you will be exposed to, overwhelmed with and bullied by all of the cultural ""social justice"" issues of the day. Working at Comcast will not give you a personal sense of worth nor will it give you hope for your future. You will go to work each day and perform some tasks within a functional group however value will not be added to your life. The best you can hope for is to be blessed by a few personal relationships you are able to develop with some of your co-workers. This is what will sustain you. Over the last 4-5 yrs of my career at Comcast, my annual ""performance increases"" were a measly 2%. And I say ""performance increases"" because my annual reviews had nothing to do with my actual performance. Annual salary increases are determined during the annual budgeting process and understand that this company is ALWAYS looking for costs to cut. Costs associated with employees are always the first cuts made. Each year after the budget process is completed in Q3, headcount cuts are made in Q4. I was a witness to this the past 5-8 years. If you seek ""job security"" then you will likely be able to find that at Comcast as long as you have no dreams or career aspirations. If you are someone who wants to make a difference or you want your hard work to be appreciated and rewarded then Comcast is not the place for you. Your obvious question to me after reading this is, ""Why did you stay there for over 16 years then?!?!"" I worked in 5 different positions over the 16+ years, so changing roles kept me going and introduced me to new colleagues whom I would then develop relationships with.",Comcast

Working as a Xfinity Sales Associate, you are given the freedom to work your turf as you wish. Your schedule is also very flexible as long as you spend 6 hours in the field. Comcast also provide you with the tools (iPad, iPhone, SFA, Sales Support, Customer Account Access) that's needed in the field to escalation problems that may occur. Great benefits (courtesy service) also.","Since I started working for Comcast, I have seen multiple changes that affects our ability to close a sale, i.e., You cannot place customers deposits on the first bill any more, it's due at the time of sale. There is no way to schedule a job to meet most customer preference. Whatever dates and time-windows are available, that what you get. Before, you could schedule a customer for an 8am-8pm time window to get a better date. Now the biggest one, YOU CANNOT SELL SERVICE to MDUs. Outside of your turf most people will recognize you as a sales rep and most people want to know what types of deals you have. If that person lives in a MDU, you can call in the sale, but you won't get paid for it. So, it make you not want to market yourself like every sales person should. Most of the supervisor became supervisors after these changes took place so it very difficult to get them to understand why it's so hard to hit your quota consistently. To them, it's hit your quota or else, which makes it very difficult to trust that they will escalate the struggles we are having and it affect every reps motivation and confidence everyday.",Comcast

By the time you complete the job and return the vehicle to base, most of of the day has slipped you by. All you have time for is to go home for a quick rest before you have to go back and do it all over again.

If you take a rough call and need a minute before taking another, there's a good chance you'll be ""coached"" on time management. The amount of representatives that would straight up lie to customers about pricing to sell them a bundle including phone was absolutely mind blowing. If you sell a double play, two services (people typically want internet only or internet with cable) you'd get about 5 bucks in commission. If you were able to turn that sale into a triple play, you'd earn roughly 30 dollars in commission. And the elusive quad play with all 4 services would net you about 75 bucks in your pocket. Consequently, instead of selling a plan or bundle that the customer actually wanted, you'd hear reps just flat out lie about how the triple play or quad play was cheaper than the same exact plan without a phone or security.

Call Centers are always based off of Metrics & some of those metrics are unreasonable. Their call flow model is called S4. And it's scored by a 3rd party company that you CANNOT challenge unless it's obvious. And even at that point it's your supervisors decision. Each call can be challenged by your supervisor but some just don't. Bc they don't want to. I personally had a supervisor that did it on EVERY SINGLE CALL. And at the end of the day, I performed best on his team. Their attendance point system is the worst ever. You can be in trouble for missing work due to the WEATHER. Your supervisor can also fight for you. But that's like a hit and miss bc they have to ""want to fight for you"". I've seen people (yes, plural) get fired over scenarios like that. But personally my supervisor went to bat for me and saved my job. Also, They never close so you better perform real good for your metrics to ensure that you don't miss the holidays with your family.

If you want to be called nasty names that can't even be listed here, join Comcast. And management will not support you. Supervisors refuse to take customer calls because they don't want the abuse either. 20% of employees are on some form of FMLA to avoid going to work.

Comcast systems will have issues that cut into your commissions. If you bring it up your blackballed. But it takes away form your pay.

But it's the only reason I'm giving Comcast 2 stars instead of 1.","Front-line employee and supervisor-level positions are underpaid relative to comparable jobs both inside and outside the industry, resulting in lower-caliber employees/supervisors being recruited and retained, which in turns drives and sustains Comcast's notoriously poor customer service record. Supervisors are extremely overworked and overburdened with too many employees and administrative responsibilities to be effective at improving team performance, which in turn is used as a cudgel to justify low performance eval ratings and merit increases. Employees who over-achieve relative to their title and compensation are rewarded with more work and additional responsibilities, without any promotion or additional compensation, and often without adequate recognition. On the flip-side, chronically under-achieving supervisors and managers are allowed to keep their jobs seemingly in perpetuity, with almost zero accountability for their detrimental impact to team performance and morale, which is almost uniformly low throughout the front-line ranks, where employees quickly realize the reason their daily routines and processes are so broken and dysfunctional is that the same leadership that created those broken processes has been in place for years, if not decades.",Comcast

Employee surveys result in action and change which has blown me away. The culture at my center is all about learning, growth and delivering world class customer service. Want to be a leader? Learn to serve others. Want to be on the phone? We will help you be the best CSR ever. Want to explore other options/areas? We can make that happen. As long as you are showing up and putting up your best effort, leadership will bend over backwards for you. We are also making strides to simplify our processes and systems to make everyone's job (and the customer experience) easier. There is an obvious commitment to fixing what needs to be fixed - it's not just lip service. I have worked at other places that tout some new initiative or process and then let it fade away - that is not the case here. I am thankful to see follow through on implementation such as NPS. Expectations are reasonable and realistic (yet challenging) which makes it easy to focus more on the customer. Tangible benefits include highly competitive pay, pay for performance and decent benefits including one heck of a stock purchase plan.","While we are in the process of improving our systems and processes, they can still be a challenge. It is too easy to make a mistake in the billing systems which then end up impacting the customer experience. The stigma with working for Comcast.

I have taken advantage of the benefits they offer by going back to school, getting a degree, as well as taking internal training classes that Comcast offers. The leadership team that Comcast has worked to build is truly amazing. They are some of the strongest, smartest, and most caring people I have ever met. It is because of this leadership team that I was guided into opportunities to make a difference, and to move into a leadership role. Each and every leader I have had has taken time to coach me and help me find the tools necessary to get my career to where I wanted to be. Comcast cares about its employees and its customers. Every location I have worked at has felt like a family, they work together, and they help out when it's needed. Along with that, Comcast does so much around the communities that they service, a lot of which never gets recognized in the media, but Comcast does not boast about, which I think they probably should do more of.

For instance, the first day of training we received lots of GOOD swag, and invited to subscribe to all their services for a huge (almost free) discount. This is so employees can speak about the products knowledgeably. What a savings in a monthly budget! The training pay was $20.43 per hour, and then reduces to $12 per hour plus commission. The lowest earning expectation is $42,500 the first year (hourly plus commissions). This is a job that provided 8 weeks of training before even getting to the actual call center. Many companies don't offer training at all, so this is a great benefit. Also great health benefits, plus 401 K, options to purchase company stock at a discount. The company emphasis is on improving customer service these days... always a good thing. Also able to earn overtime pay quite easily.","My trainer spent too much time talking about her personal life, and then rushing through the day's training, which was stressful. Why not cut out all the small talk and go slower during training? Different trainers have different capabilities. some are better than others, so it's the luck of the draw who you get for your 8 weeks of training. There is ultra strict time-keeping... in training we learned the penalties for being even a minute late. Everything needs to be clocked, even going to the restroom. Plus the calls get monitored secretly, so you never know when you're being evaluated. There were hires that seemed to lack education, and their grammar in speaking was not good. This was surprising to me. As a customer, when I call into a call center, when a person can't use the English language appropriately, I'm uncomfortable with their degree of expertise about the product. The training facility rooms need improvement. Broken chairs that squeek LOUDLY every time you move, slow computers, only one screen to learn on when in fact the whole job relies on 2 computer screens. A lot of time is lost going back and forth between programs during training, losing information and time continually, adding to the stress and frustration. One trainer seemed much better than the one I had... I wasn't able to learn well with the trainer I was assigned. The whole training and job itself is very very regimented, so a person will have to learn to be compulsive in that way. I decided not to stay with the company eventually, because my strengths were not used working in a call center on the phone. My experience and past success has to do with person to person inter-action in real life, and so I can understand why the pay and earnings are better than average. It's a job that not everyone wants to do. Being in a call center all day is not for me, but some people obviously like it and do well.",Comcast

Customers are angry, all the time. I never talked to anyone who hadn't already called at least 3 times previously.

Metrics encourage a wham bam thank you ma'am approach under which your Average Handle Time will meet expectations but nothing actually get's fixed. You are offered plenty of Vacation time but being able to take it is a whole different problem. If you dont know about your vacation a year in advance then good luck. If you want to take a random Wed evening off sure thats not an issue... not never two days in a row. I never once in 4.5 years was able to take all the vacation time allotted to me. I was never able to move out of my position and into higher tierd support or even across departments due to my AHT being 10 seconds outside of Expectation. Bear in mind I consistently had some of the best Call Quality scores, exceeded Sales expectations regularly, had Multiple Manager recommend me for promotion, received more customer Kudo's than I can count, and never had to call escalations for assistance.

3895,"""Comcast has created the Perfect Prejudice Paradigm""",1.0,Good benefits package and company is provides entry level training.,"Comcast has created a method for which it can target employees, and eliminates them without the risk of being accused of wrongdoing. This method consists of pining its employees against each other, particularly the front-line employees against their own supervisors. Managers (the supervisors of supervisors) are tasked with holding meetings with front-line employees to solicit feedback on their supervisor's behavior. Of course, these meetings are sanctioned by HR and are held without the presence of supervisors. During the meetings, managers get the employees wound up to say anything, and will use this information to provide corrective action against the employees' supervisors. There is no need for the manager to have his own knowledge of the capacity of the supervisor. In fact, if the manager knows the supervisor well, he may be in a position to understand that the feedback provided by these meetings could be prejudiced, because of the ""gang up"" behavior produced when folks are free to talk without being held responsible for their words. If this personal knowledge were ever an issue (a liability in the process), they would rotate the managers to different work locations, eliminating any history between the manager and his supervisors. This way the managers will depend on the feedback provided by the front-line employees as the only source for corrective actions. This process is used against one supervisor at a time, and its main focus is to push unrealistic goals against all employees. The process is similar to what has been uncovered recently with the scandal related to Wells Fargo. Companies have to stay competitive, but some have found methods to boost their performance beyond the limits. What they do initially is create unrealistic goals for the employees. At first, the employees which are loyal to their own work ethics will be the first to go out the door. They will be dismissed for not meeting the goals. The ones that stay behind and survive realize that they can only do so by cheating. Although the company is squeezing the goals, it does not necessarily increase the level of ethics compliance. That is, it does not pursue ethics compliance as a hot potato, in the same way they pursue the goals watched by investors. The cheats then artificially increase the performance of the company, which is a win for the investors as well as the company, but not necessarily for the employees. Management understands that employees are cheating, although they act like managers are completely out of the picture, and they exhibit this extraordinary level of performance as a well planned, well executed, and natural occurrence. However, if they have a problem with an employee, all they have to do is expose the employee's ethics. I mean, at that level they could literally expose anyone and get rid of them. Unrealistic goals happen in many areas, but two of the critical ones are sales and quality. If the profits look unrealistic, it may very well be that the methods for obtaining these profits are also unrealistic, and primarily unethical. While I was working at the technical side of Comcast, the unrealistic goal was the repeat service call metrics (a quality measure that accounts for repeat service calls, within a 30 day period after a technician visits a customer's home). This metric was just below the 8%, and right now (a year after I left) it may be at 7% or less. Every year it was been dropped to a new and even more unrealistic level, with no sign of stopping, and every day you could increasingly hear the talk about how the cheaters made it happen. The team becomes divided between cheaters and non-cheaters. If a non-cheater tells a cheater; ""let's all be part of a team and tell us your methods, so we can improve our performance,"" the usual response is ""I'm not doing anything different than anyone else."" It's essential for employees to learn and improve their performance through other folks' experiences (although this sharing of information is not really promoted within the company), but there is no real magic bullet that anyone is willing to share. These unrealistic goals create a level of stress that can't be properly managed by the employees, and a great part of it ends up as the wrath generated against supervisors during these feedback meetings. Since the managers depend solely on the feedback of these meetings to make critical decisions about the supervisors, the whole exercise provides a means to target supervisors at will, while at the same time continuing to stage unrealistic levels of performance for their employees. This happens without Comcast, or its upper management, ever becoming responsible for any prejudice done. However, the prejudice is done with the targeted pinning of employees against themselves, as required by the needs of the business. It’s a business driven with fear that produces a very toxic environment, with false readings and performance, and where employees are stripped of their humanity.",Comcast

To find the truth, please review the cons. -During my first year, it was work at your own pace and sell to anyone and everyone. The job was everything you would want it to be just as long as you made your numbers/sales and were in compliance with company policies. -Employees received high recognition for their accomplishments. -Base salary plus commission, All company products were discounted to the employee, gas allowance, new uniforms and supplies provided, bonuses for high producers w/ the possibility to achieve a 6 figure income.","-Everything that was a PRO usually changed on an often basis because management was ever always shifting around after my first year. -Within the two years that I worked for Comcast, 7 direct and senior managers were either replaced, fired, or asked to resign. The shift in management is still ongoing from my understanding. -Always constant change with how the sales reps were able to make sales. One minute you might be paid for a sale, the next day, it might be taken away from the rep due to the area that it was sold in. The next week, the rep may be able to sell in that same area again with no penalties. -Comcast is in competition with itself. As a sales rep, I constantly had to not only sell against Direct TV, Dish Network, and AT&T U Verse, but also Comcast itself. I had clients who consistently found better deals through Comcast.com, a local retailer, 3rd party retailers, etc than I was able to offer them. The only way that I could insure a sale is by hoping to find the customer before they were able to find the lower sale price. -Your sales depend on many factors. 1. The call center has to key your sale in perfectly. 2. The technician who does the installation for the sale must show up for the job, do their installation up to standard and educate the customer on the products (to which sometimes a tech will blow off a job or work short cuts that will hinder the customer's experience). 3. The customer must stay happy with your product or you will be charged back. Most sales team managers will tell you that a customer must call 1-800-Comcast if he/she has a problem. The problem is that if you present yourself as the direct liaison (to which you are encouraged by the team leaders to do to get the sale) between the customer and Comcast, then the customer will be contacting you when there is a problem with their system. The answer the team leaders tell you to give to the customer is ""Call 1-800-COMCAST"". -1-800-COMCAST has the worst customer service in the world. You can be on hold for over 45 minutes and then your call is dropped. Calling back within the very next second will cause the caller to have to wait possibly just as long again. -Weekly meetings were always changed. Sometimes the meetings were just a few phone call meetings and one meeting as a team at the local Comcast office. My former team leader would have no regard for time and sometimes extend the meeting from late morning into the mid afternoon. Then we were made to attend daily meetings at the office for as short as 30 minutes. This would cause most sales reps to drive 30-60 mins to the office, just to turn around and drive 30-60 mins back to their designated turf areas. Comcast would only reimburse the rep for $300 (before taxes) of gas monthly. -When Comcast offered gift cards to close a sale between a sales rep and the customer, the company rarely ever delivered on giving the customer the gift card. When I was a rep, we had a chance to lure a customer away from their current television/internet provider by offering up to $400 in gift cards. Many clients never received their gift cards which left stress between the client and the sales rep. -If the sales rep makes a mistake with a customer's order, and the order is completed or closed out, the stress is left between the customer and the sales rep. The company will not try to repair the incident. -Team Leaders just want to keep their jobs. Team Leaders would rather fight for their own jobs instead for their team member's even when they know the decisions of the company's sales management are ethically questionable. -Turf management (the sales reps respected sales area) for sales reps was directed by upper management based on clients and addresses who have not had Comcast before. Most of those addresses designated by management were empty lots where there were unfinished subdivisions, or sometimes even Trailer parks that were no longer in existence. You cannot sell to a client or house that isn't there. -If you decide to leave the company, you will not be permitted to return. Even if you were a top producing employee with no disciplinary record and have left a two week notice, you will not be permitted to go back to work for Comcast. The inside word (from management) is that if an employee leaves the Comcast company then he/she will not be permitted to return due to the fact that since the former employee left Comcast in the first place, it shows a sign of non-commitment to Comcast. -Newer employees often felt disheartened toward coming into a job with shifting management",Comcast

Cord cutters, market saturation, major competition, popularity of online streaming originals etc. Comcast seems to be throwing things at a wall and seeing what sticks. Cannot apply for other internal opportunities for a year. It is ALL about your stats and metrics (Scorecard). To higher ups, you are just a number on a report. Pushed constantly to sell, sell, sell.

And it is REQUIRED of all reps. No benefits or time off while in training and residency (first 90 days) and very strict about time keeping and schedule adherence. Understandable, but life happens too. If you need schedule flexibility, tons of work/life balance – call center is NOT the job for you. Comcast University training does not prepare you fully in any way for everything you encounter when you really go out on the floor to take live calls. Not even close. Internal technology and trouble shooting system shockingly awful and difficult to manage. Constant glitches, bugs and crashes.

He merely advised you to reach out to someone else on all matters. Not to mention he never supplied all work tools.

Clueless/useless ""leadership"" who have no idea what they should be doing or what their employees should be or are doing. 7. Recognition can be non-existent or overly gratuitous to the point it's insulting. 8. Come review time, expect a lot of mental masturbation but an embarrassingly low increase in pay.

Manager: Yes, you did solve their issue and you did sell them on an additional line of service, completed in under 8 minutes and they asked to speak directly to me after the call to say how wonderfully helpful you were BUT your verbiage did not flow in the manner which is outlined according to the Comcast S4 Standard. This is the third review I've told you about this and if it continues I'll have to move forward with disciplinary actions. If the issue is still not resolved after that, then termination is the final step. Me: I quit. They provide 8 weeks paid training prior to start working.

You definitely get what you pay for. They expect you to handle any and every situation successfully within a few minutes. Follow-ups, due to excessive/escalated issues, to customers are looked down on. They have virtually impossible sales expectations but still want you to upsell products and services even when customers really don't need or want them. It's no wonder they have been in the Customer Service Hall of Shame top 5 slots for the most part of the last decade. It is completely pointless when filling out their internal surveys or participating in the focus groups (they claim to want to know your thoughts and opinions) because they never listen to their low level employees. If you happen to be a member of management, you are never wrong even when it can be proven that you were wrong. Non-management employees get blamed for everything and when you provide your evidence of their wrong doing or your innocence, you get labeled as some sort of a domestic terrorist. Therefore, don't look for any type of praise but definitely expect to be reprimanded. Also, don't look for any type of assistance from management. Some of them could care less about helping you and the others can't help you because they don't know what they are doing. There were very few supervisors/managers that actually knew the job and even fewer that cared. Any type of upward or lateral mobility is a struggle even when you have the education, work ethic, and experience. Plan on being stuck in that position of yours for a while. Communication between departments is a joke. The left hand never knows what the right hand is doing and vice versa.

When you ask for guidance, you don't get the policy, you get ""an opinion"".

For the laundry list of tasks that are expected of you, it is easy to make a mistake now and then.

Although they have been removing choices over the years, medical, dental, and other similar coverage tends to be fairly good. You typically get an extremely good discount on services. Working conditions tend to be pretty good unless you're one of the poor guys who happens to be out in the field on a horrible weather day (keep in mind 100 degrees can sometimes be worse than cold and wet). Good ability to move around to other positions and good ability to move to other parts of the country if desired (although more difficult to move up strictly by way of superior performance alone). While there are options to Comcast's services, at the moment they are typically poorer ones, resulting in fairly good job security so long as you're a fair to solid performer. More competition is on the horizon, however Comcast is often a step ahead.","Appearance of function is often more important than actual function, both internally and externally. Statistics are fairly easily manipulated if you know how. Too often localized management displays rather short term business behaviors in trying to shine for upper local or centralized senior corporate leadership (Philly). Those in higher positions of power often have little idea of how things really work locally and on the front line, but think they do and those under them are often either ignorant themselves or simply to scared to correct them, resulting in the implementation of negatively impacting policies as a result. Even if local or senior leadership do confer with local or front line employees they rarely listen and typically move forward with their ideas, or those of their superiors, regardless. It's hard to say if this is out of arrogance or a mistrust that the employees aren't being honest with them. Speaking up about such issues is often ignored outright or can result in someone being labeled a bad employee, even so far as being targeted to get rid of (and HR will often not have your back in such a case since it's that persons superiors who have their ear). Internal policy often drives negative employee behavior. Front line employees are often given conflicting goals. For example, in tech support our employee reviews are negatively impacted if we send a technician to a customers home as compared to correcting the issue over the phone, providing us with a reason to not help customers that need in-person support requiring a truck roll. Tech support reps often find ways to get the customer to call back rather than schedule an in-person service call in order to pass the known needed truck roll on to another tech support agent. This is one of the various reasons customers have to call multiple times to get the help they need. Outsourcing aspects of the service, sometimes even internal support, is causing problems that are being ignored too long for the sake of saving money on paper or, if money is actually being saved, it's only in the short term. Customer service suffers for the sake of saving a little money and in the long run money will be lost due to bad customer service. With the increase in cell phone usage and the advent of internet based entertainment this will become a bigger liability in the near future. Benefits, while still good, have been getting reduced over the years. Higher end medical plan options have repeatedly been done away with over the years and 401k match dropped a several years back. Yet Comcast makes higher (record) profits every single year. Perhaps this is why? You need to be a Yes-Man in order to move up. Even if your criticisms are legitimate there's rarely any point to voicing them. While middle management is somewhat to blame for this it can be argued the reason they don't try is because they are often stuck in the same situation with their local superiors. In most chains of command at Comcast you'll often run into someone who is afraid to rock the boat for the greater good of the company due to the fear of drawing attention to the fact that things aren't quite as rosy as people been painting them to be. As a result you will likely draw the, often silent, ire of your superiors by speaking up. Surprisingly, for one of the worlds largest communications companies in the world, Comcast needs to update their measuring stick for how the company is gauged. Television subscribers are still largely considered the primary focus, yet other services are more profitable. Unfortunately, none of this is all that unusual in a corporation as large as Comcast, however the problems seem more magnified at Comcast based on my knowledge of other companies.",Comcast

Even if you got enough sales, you still get reprimanded if they all didn't get installed in the 2 weeks, even if the factors are out of your control. I struggled for awhile but they let me go when I was getting 4-5 sales a week and mastered it. One time I got did sell everything but home security and despite doing selling well with tv, internet, and phone, I got scolded for not getting the XH installed which is total BS. Also, the sales ""success plan"" only hurts employees more than it helps. I got put on it during the winter time while working in area that had no solicitor permits left and right. Upper management doesn't take that into consideration. The area you work makes ALL the difference. I'd also like to say that people are already apprehensive about door to door sales reps. Some people may call the cops on you, just for doing your job. The most common complaint I got was ding ding, terrible customer service. It's so bad that we couldn't get them back if we offered it for free. Hearing some of the horror stories from customer service makes it difficult to even sell them.

They do pay mileage at federal rate but cap it at $100 per week....you will go through this in 1-2 days...the additional amount is ""cost of doing business"" and will come out of your pocket. Comp plan is decent. There are accelerators for the few that can hit them but also very steep detracters if you fall short of goal. (More reps miss there number than make it) You always know where you stand among your colleagues. Everyday a report is sent out to all sales employees in the region that shows everyone else's sales numbers month to date so you know how you stack up. Great if you are doing well, but demoralizing if you are not.","Think of all the perks that come with most sales jobs...freedom, flexible schedule, working remotely, etc. This has NONE of that!!! Regarding my brief 3 month experience on the Central Connecticut Team in WNE (Berlin, CT). Here, you will be required to check into the office everyday at 8AM but be out of the office before 9:30am to get in your car to drive back from where you came from (most salespeople live in the territory they cover). You will then go knock doors prospecting for business. At 3:00pm you are required to be back in the Berlin office to make phone calls till 5PM or submit orders, while the manager walks around to make sure people are making calls. At 5PM, there is a mandatory team conference call that will last between 30-45 minutes where you will explain what you did that day, how many sales you got, new opportunities found, number of appointments you sat on that day, number of appointments the following day, and your forecast for tomorrow. If you make a sale and it happened to contain voice and data, but the client did not want TV, you will need to explain why you they did not get TV and vice versa. If you sold a lower tier Internet speed, you will have to explain why it was not a 50Mbps or faster connection. In some instances the manager will insist going back to the client together and try to convince the client to get all 3 services or to increase their speed, because you as the sales professional, clearly did not listen to their needs the first time. If you leave before the call is over you will be labeled a ""non team player"", so hopefully you dont mind traffic. My commute was dificult, but not nearly as bad as the guy who lived in the springfield Massachusetts area (yes he had to be in the office twice everyday too...no exceptions) Tuesdays and Thursdays you will have in person huddles where they will teach you things such as top down selling, wedge statements, open ended questions, or practice role plays (great information if you have never had a sales job before). After the huddle you will have a 1 on 1 with your manager or a ride day where he shadows you and tells you what you did right or wrong in a condescending tone. In the event that you miss a team huddle for being sick or more than 5 minutes late, you will have to make it up later that week with the manager. On any given day, there can be no more than 2 people off due to ""business needs"", this includes holidays such as day before thanksgiving, black friday, Christmas eve, day after christmas, new years eve and new years day among others. I worked there for 3 months and went through velocity training and finished my ramp period. At the end of that time, my manager held a formal review and said that ""unfortunately it was not going to work out and that I did not have the attitude needed to be successful here"", so i was let go. Part of me felt bad being rejected and all, but I was also happy knowing that I would not have to endure this horrible and demeaning sales culture any longer. Had I known before hand what this job was all about, I never would have accepted it. I have had several sales jobs over my career, recently coming over from the online advertising industry and have never been treated like this before. Hope someone finds this information useful before making the same mistake I made.",Comcast

Comcast's products and services are often on bleeding edge and employees cannot help but be excited to sell or support them. Depending on regional leadership, Comcast fosters a super culture of collaboration. Washington state business services used to be this way.","Business Services Washington may have too many sales people considering how mature the market is. Comcast has a tendency to hire more people to get more sales, but this creates high employee churn. There are also numerous and significant operational obstacles that make it hard to focus on sales. The Seattle business services market has been at the very bottom of company performance ranking for 2.5 years. Numerous possible explanations exist for this but it may stem from the type of culture that has existed under the VP and his immediate team. The Washington state business services market leader has created a fairly fearful and exclusive culture. There are lots of politics. The VP has surrounded himself with ""yes"" people that he worked with from past jobs - most of whom are not particularly competent or stay employed places very long. None of these people appointed or hired by the VP have ever been fired despite the Seattle region being one of he worst regions in the company. Instead, anyone who isn't perceived as being part of the C.Y.A. Culture (usually tenured people hired by other leaders) are scapegoated and pushed out. HR and corporate leaders are either clueless or powerless to do anything about this. Advancement used to be common in the business service group but most leadership roles are usually hired from outside now ( cronies of VP or his people from Centurylink).",Comcast

It’s easier to manipulate metrics than it is to manage people, so management spends most of their time generating metrics that support that they are doing a good job, even when they are failing. Any time that they spend with their employees is usually spent cracking the whip. Comcast is known to be the worst company in America for 2015. This is not my opinion, this is according to the American Customer Satisfaction survey and the Consumerist (I wouldn’t have ranked us that low, I truly thought we were a better company). This isn’t just an anomaly for 2015, they frequently rank lowest or second to lowest for telecom, it’s just this year they scored low enough to be considered the worst across all industries. Congratulations, I guess. The company’s reputation was so bad that they had to rebrand its services as Xfinity, but they did nothing to improve the people experience, so the high cost of rebranding bought them nothing.

There are a lot of customers that love Comcast, but those people don't call in to tell you that. You only hear from 15% of their customers, and those 15% call A LOT. Even in this day in age, most people don't realize that their awesome promotional rates expires after 6-12 months. The majority of your calls are ""why did my bill go up""; and, 95% of the time in billing, there was nothing you could do to lower their package pricing down. Package pricing and why the billing increased are the majority of your calls. Those calls mixed with, ""why am I charged $50 for you to fix my outlet (obviously not free, call a local repair man next time and see what they charge"", ""I didn't order this movie, remove the charge"", ""no one told me there would be an install charge"", ""why did I lose channels"", and ""no one told me a DVR would cost more monthly"". I could do on and on but you get the gist and what I'm trying to get at is, you get yelled at a lot. Since most reps get yelled at all day, they in turn don't bring a lot of enthusiasm to work and then pass those feelings onto the next person they talk to. One of biggest issues as a billing representative is Comcast sales reps have a lot of pressure to make sales. It seemed to me and others that sales reps would neglect to mention details about how the pricing works, lie about install charges, when items increase etc and then we would have to try and fix the mess. Most new reps start with the late shift, when I was there it was 12:30 - 9PM, and you got split days off. Most people have to work Saturday. I got Thursdays and Sundays off (company is closed on Sundays) - There were trying to fix scheduling so I'm not sure where it's at now. Since Comcast has 30+ Million customers, there were a lot of out sourced reps from India taking calls as well and that can lead to communication issues internally and complaints from Comcast's customers.

It lower the average commission by around 1000 or more a month. They also increased sales goals for most months during what they call the busiest months but most saw no increase in sales but rather a decrease and a clear drastic loss of income. Also, management use to give some leeway towards bad periods and take into account your overall sales performance but not anymore. If you fail to perform in just one two week interval you are written up and in that first write up you have to keep your sales on track for 6 periods aka 3 months or you go to stage 2 and if you don't perform in the next 6 periods you go to stage 3 then the next failed period and their showing you the door. They will badger you until you quit which is their MO by the way. They do this to avoid having to pay your unemployment. If you resign they will deny you unemployment.

On top of this, Comcast does provide a lot of benefits such as complimentary services (cable, internet) and deeply discounted prices on rentals of equipment. You start off with two weeks vacation, then another week at 5 yrs and another week of vacation at 10 yrs; 4 weeks after 10 yrs. You are also paid for holidays and overtime holiday pay if worked. They recognize 7 federal holidays. They also provide more PTO called flex (personal day) for an additional 64 hrs and three floating holidays of your choice. So after 10 yrs, 4 weeks vacation +7 holiday's off + 64 hrs flex (PTO) + 24 hrs of floating holidays. That is all paid. You also get the other goodies too, health, dental insurance etc. I have learned A LOT working here and with the company being very large, you can always switch departments if something isn't working out. Also when calling off here, you don't have to fake that you are sick *cough *cough, or your great aunt is dead. You call in and tell your supervisor ""I'm not coming in today"" and that's it. No drawn out excuse or harassment about not coming in. I was told about the call-off policy day one. They explained to me ""We only need to know if you are coming in or not, your personal life is YOUR business not Comcast's"". I agreed completely. I wish other companies would adopt a similar policy.","While the benefits are great the pay doesn't feel very competitive, especially for top performers. You are typically mired at about an average 2.5% overall annual merit increase (4% if you are VERY lucky). The company does conduct an annual survey to get feedback, as a result Comcast has implemented certification programs that offer a small pay bump as well as quarterly bonuses. While these are still great additions, the certification programs still leave a bit to be desired.

Nobody likes efficiency because that means less busy work. As long as they look busy, the managers are so buried in their own troubles they don't know who is under performing. Also, they loom their amazing benefits over your head as justification for why we are paid so far below the industry average.",Comcast

I found that for a leading technology firm, our reporting system was outdated and didn't accurately reflect the sales we were capturing sometimes inflating them and other times understating them--which left our meetings ominous for detecting which sales approaches were effective and those which were not. Because the company is so large, it takes quite some time to get permission to make changes to a customary way of doing things even though the system is broken and doesn't serve the business in the long run. Though not always the case in other departments, I felt a very strong sense of micro-management--not my personal preference, but not to be taken personally as my directive preferred a hands-on approach and likes to know all aspects of the business. My biggest thing was that I was working for a capped commission which I was told was going to change the entire time I worked there without it ever changing--reducing my earnings potential substantially for my role.",Comcast

Rainy day money ! you get to drive the work truck home if you want. you get to stop and pee on the side of the road if you have ''to go''. you can speed and run lights in trucks, cops are pretty cool...just dont get crazy. free uniforms and boots. If you can figure out how to manage the system and numbers to stay off the radar then you could have a good run there. Its all about working the numbers.","pay is ok. youre just above poverty...and if you are the only income in your family then you will definitely need food stamps / govt. assistance. You'll probably need food stamps anyway, the pay is low compared to living. Management doesn't care. You are responsible even if it not anything you can control or fix. There are multiple formulas they use to grade you. repeat rate, service on install rate, on time rate, customer survey rate etc... Lets say you go to a customers house and the house is up to BRIS standards. The customer keeps having ongoing issues with the comcast phone service. You check everything and find no issues. you leave. customer calls back in a couple days to report issue is back again... guess what, YOU get penalized for that. These add up and determine your raise and promtions at the end of the year. Even though the customers house is up to BRIS standards and evertyhing checks out ok and you know the neighborhood is a constant problem that ends up being a system capacity issue GUESS WHAT, it's still your fault and you get dinged and those numbers affect your performance review, your pay, your status. Turnaround is pretty high. There is ALWAYS new hires coming in. This job is very misleading in the job description and interviews.... You think you will be going to people houses and showing them how to work the internet and tv and laugh and have a good time BUT you are really racing there because you are in a timed window and if youre late, youre in trouble with your numbers. Then you need to check the oustide for correct wiring, ground, fittings etc... then you need to check the split point for correct fittings and signal THEN you need to check Every outlet for fittings and issues THEN you fix the issue from the customer calling in. ..... hope you can figure out how to do all that fairly quickly and without error. You get two 16 ounce bottles of gatorade once a week to help keep you hydrated. The Corporate monkeys only care about numbers on paper.

It is to make the sale, then do everything you can to get a tech to actually install the customer. Techs will use every trick in the book to not connect a customer, the tech supervisor will back his techs, but your sales manager will not have your back. When you actually get a connect, but aren't paid correctly, it is your job to annoy your boss until you give up. It is also your job to knock doors, and someone in another state decides what addresses you will knock. Be prepared to knock tons of empty houses and addresses that have duplicates in the billing system so you get to look stupid when they already have a triple play. Unfortunately, even if you know they are active, you still have to knock that door. If you care about your reputation or about customer experience, do not get this job. It will only cause you stress. Trying to fix any problem will anger management, because you aren't getting more sales the more time you spend on an active customers account. If your supervisor loses your paperwork, you are expected to redo it. Management is never at fault for anything. The gas mileage allowance is taxed on your paycheck now, and won't cover half of your gas. If you ask question to find out how to do things correctly, you will only anger your boss. The training is a joke. Comcast will not teach you how to use any electronic system that you will have to use for work. They will constantly change rules without any internal communication. In March 2015, Comcast restructured the commissions and turf management. The majority of what reps were told were changed without letting any reps know. Expect quotas that are improbable to meet. Two home security sales every two weeks, yet the top ranking team had 1.5 home security per rep last fiscal month. Most reps will hardly ever sale a phone or a home security. Even if you do, charge backs will become the bane of your existence. Get 10 sales, maybe 5 get installed. Hopefully 2 won't charge back. Never sell to friends or family or neighbors. Either they will have problems or they will charge back on you. Be prepared to live on $27,000 a year, ruin a vehicle, be micromanaged, constant stress, and never have time with your family. This isn't a sales job. It is a constant dead end fight. Fight for your sales, your connects, your pay, and fight for the customer. Dead end at this job, because there isn't any career path. While fighting for the customer, you will learn that for a communication company, there isn't any communication between departments. Tech ops, direct sales, .com, etc are always at odds.

Supervisors approach to motivation is prehistoric and full of insinuated threats and poor cheap rhetoric. Last but never least, Sales competes with itself with different offers and pricing, and a brutal schizoid advertising investment, designed probably by 13 year old nincompoops. Comcast let you ""buy"" its continuously growing lines of business on Internet, Direct Mail, Telemarketing, Retail Boots, (its own) Stores, Direct Sales Reps, external Contractors and TV/Customer Service. So, good luck if you think there's something to do in a Sales position in this futuristic, yet retrograde company. Products, so far, are an enormous line-up of Cable Channels (where you can barely choose two or three to watch), Internet (their best product), Telephone, (nice features and reach), Home Security (that nobody understand how it works and less who can install it properly), Solar (per their own advertising) and probably Taxi Service and Pop Corn Delivery as the trend goes, …. in a few months.",Comcast

The second most common deception used by outsourcers and sales agents is that they will tell customers ""Oh the package is $99.99 with everything"" but they wont tell them that on top of that theres a $10 modem rental fee, each additional tv box is $9.95, HD is an extra $10, DVR is an extra $10, and taxes are extra and guess who has to fix the mess when the customer gets their bill? retention department. - By the time the customer gets to speak to the retention department they already spoke to at least 2-3 other departments who couldnt help them and each time they were screened by previous agents for adding more lines of business then handed off to another department like a hot potato if they cant get any sale from the customer which causes frustration and angry customers by the time they finally get to retention. - To add a little more to my previous comment, retention agents are also responsible for adding lines of business but the customer is screened by previous agents that they spoke to before getting to retention to see if they can get any line of business sales from the customer so only the customers that they couldnt get a sale from get transferred to retention and retention then has to try to upsell those customers or give them the smallest discount possible if they dont want to add a line of business or disconnect them. - Many agents refuse to help a customer at all if their account has Xfinity Home (home security) because they dont understand the product enough to help the customer so they usually just transfer them to Xfinity Home Retention even if all they needed was help with billing questions or if they wanted to make changes to their other services that werent home security. - Retention is seen by other departments as the dumping ground to resolve customer issues even when a call isnt really a retention call, ive gotten billing agents that transfer accounts that are already disconnected (how is that a retention call?) to place some credits on the customers accounts because of billing errors but that waste my time because we only get commission on calls where the account is still active so thats time spent that you could be helping someone else who has an active account with the company. - When an outsource agent or sales agent adds a line of business that the customer didnt want or ask for to their account the retention agent is responsible for removing that line of business but if the customer never agreed to add the service or was never informed that the agent was adding that service to their account how is that fair to the customer and the retention agent who takes a hit on their numbers? the most common cases right now are agents adding home phone or the cheapest home alarm package ($20 a month) via self install kit and the customer calls when they receive the equipment in the mail to ask why they received the equipment for a service that they werent aware they were getting then its the retention agents job to sell the value of the product that they never asked for or take a hit for the service and remove it from the account. - Retention agents have to deal with sneaky people within the company sabotaging their retention efforts in order to get a sale for example its often the case where a sales person will create a new account in the new address where a customer moved to but that same sales person will then transfer the customer to retention department to disconnect the account at the previous address and not tell the retention agent that they created another account for the customer, the correct process is for the agent to transfer the account from the old address to the new one and disconnect the old account before connecting the new one but sometimes they dont disconnect the old account so that they dont have to spend more time with the customer on the line. This can affect the retention agents numbers because since the sales person didnt do their job properly if you dont know that the customer has two accounts you will disconnect an account that someone else was suposed to disconnect hurting your numbers. - Sometimes sales agents will collaborate with customers telling them that they should disconnect their account and then speak to them to create an account under their spouses name to get a new customer promotion so that they can get a sale which is unethical because their manipulating the system for personal gain at the expense of the company and other employees.",Comcast

Good opportunities to earn lots of money if you knew how to sell products. Opportunity to earn overtime.,"Oh where to start... Management is a joke in some departments. To get a manager to take a escalated call is like pulling teeth at times. I went through multiple management changes in the almost 5 years I worked there. I have a few good managers and a few managers that I wanted to escalate every call I was on just to make her life difficult on purpose. The ability to grow in the company was extremely limited. You had to be either exceptional at your job or know someone to get promotions. The customers wear you down and down and down. You will get called names, cursed at, yelled at. They expect the worst customer service because that is what Comcast is known for but when you try to turn around their perceptions and over come their roadblocks it's like pulling teeth. So when it comes to call quality and their cqe's (listening to your call and getting reviewed by it) it feels almost impossible to meet all the expectations. Training is a JOKE! Yes, the initial training is good but once your on the floor trying to keep up with everything feels impossible so sometimes your calls take longer than they should because you're digging through information making sure that this customer is eligible or that the information you know is correct. When I was there every few months they would announce they would set aside training hours but then never would follow through. The mandatory overtime wears you down, an 8 hour shift getting turned into 9 or a 10 into 11 wouldn't seem like much but it can add up. There is really no significant raises after you're hired. It's based on your performance but I believe the cap is .30 cents. You are somewhat micromanaged if you aren't meeting goals in what ever they are pushing you can get into trouble pretty quickly. Coaching is non existent though. Managers will be the first to pipe up if you're doing something wrong but rather than give helpful hints or anything to help you grow they kinda leave it at that. I worked there for quite some time and I didn't meet my sales goal ONCE and my manager had the audacity to say to me why are we hiring you if you can't do the job. Managers play favorites with staff. Also I HATED rate increases and explaining them to the customer was extremely hard at times.

Job can be stressful especially when dealing with Irate customers almost every day which can set your tone for the day. They don't really specifically train you in those situations just generalizations of de-escalation. It is mentally draining sometimes days in a row. It is a 40 hr week job which if your on an 8hr day shift your there for 8.5 hours because lunch is not paid. I know that many businesses do make an 8hr day be an 8hr day. Many times, time off requests can be denied or you get put on waiting list. Its amazing how often comcast outages occur on the network every day, very fragile system it seems. They put business customers services over a very old residential infrastructure and the business network should have its own network instead of trying to buyout other companies they should pour the money into the network build out and make these outages go away. Its 2015 and as mature as cable is more than 30 years you would think they got this down pat and reliability.

Things just keep getting worse. More clueless directors, middle and upper management. No wonder customers hate Comcast. Everything has become so disjointed, and inconsistent. There has been WAY too much outsourcing. The company has outsourced so many job functions, that it has lost direction. Departments are often working at cross-purposes. Pay is WELL below industry peers. All management knows how to do is micro-manage and change direction. Every new VP or upper management member that comes in drastically changes our direction and organization, just so they can look like they're trying to improve things. All this does is disrupt employees' lives by either a layoff or quintupling commutes! All for no real benefit. The micro-managing is done by middle and upper management trying to control things they have never done or have any idea about whatsoever. Different departments are at odds with each other. Management will not even consider letting employees, whose whole jobs are on the PC, work from home. I believe this is more of their micro-management. Pay is different for employees doing the exact same job. Those of us who are motivated and work hard are given more work, while those who slack are left alone to slack off some more, even spending their day on IM with their love interest. . Upper management has enacted pay caps, basically eliminating employee motivation. I'm sure management hasn't capped their pay, have they? Great behavior for a multi-billion dollar company. So much of customer service has been outsourced, both in and out of country, that the customer frustration factor has increased exponentially. Management needs to realize that you get what you pay for. Since removing motivation for long-term employees, it seems the drive is to try to get rid of those of us who have been here long-term in favor of new employees they can pay less. Also, HR is completely useless; merely a mouthpiece for upper management. Their employee retention policy is to tell us ""be happy you have a job."" WOW, there's a motivator.....to look elsewhere. Upper management is so disconnected from reality. They really have no idea what is going on beyond our stock price. You let the bean counters make WAY too many of the decisions. Employee morale is is so low, as to be nonexistent. We all hate our jobs. The only thing keeping us coming in is our paycheck. This used to be a career for me, but since 2010, its just a paycheck. Employee morale is so low because we all know things will NEVER get better. Management needs to realize that their smoke and mirrors attempts (Credo-speak survey, Credo-Pulse survey) to give the impression that they are trying to improve things don't fool us. Local management does what they can. Unfortunately any real power to improve things has been taken away",Comcast

I love that you can be truly be yourself at Comcast. They love families so you can work side by side with your daughter, son, spouse, aunt, cousin, friend, uncle, etc. As a gay male I have felt nothing but fully accepted and loved that a lot of the leadership was openly gay also, it certainly is a family environment and everyone is very supportive and helpful. I would have to say the good eggs certainly overshadow the bad ones. Comcast is a conglomerate and I love that they're are a variety of entities within the organization so do NOT limit yourself to just one position. You qualify for a transfer after just 6 months which is just amazing. Comcast truly is an exceptional service being that I have had them all, so you do get what you pay for. They do train the new hires properly, and even if you don't know everything (which you won't) it is okay just ask your peers they are more than helpful. Oh, and you will never go hungry at Comcast for sure so don't worry about lunch money because they will always feed you, every time you look up there is pizza, cake, donuts, ice cream, pasta, chicken, ribs, steak, sandwiches, chinese food, etc.","Work-life balance is difficult especially if you are commission based because you will be basically forced to do overtime to maintain the level pay you have become accustom to. Customers really do determine your pay structure, you can be the best salesman available, however during months when college kids call to discontinue their service because they are going back home for the winter, you lose money from your pocket. When customers call to discontinue service because it is at their second home or vacation home, you lose money. Certain things that are out of your control you take a hit for it and are just told to OWN IT! Recently Comcast has made a decision to convert their system over to CSG database which has caused a huge headache for many agents across the country because not only were we poorly trained on the new system but the system was flawed during its release which caused customers accounts to screwed up but we could not fix the accounts because we did not have the tools to fix the job. So we were simply told to lie to the customer to get them off the phone and write down the account and hope that you remember to fix that one account after handling over 40 accounts a day 5 - 6 days a week if you worked OT or not. Vacation, flex, floating, and sick days are okay but if you are working in the call center with this high level stress you are going to use them up faster than you got them. And if you live in an area where the weather does potentially get bad around the winter season you are advised to save your flex just for those days which is unrealistic because sometimes you do need to take some time off just to recoup from all the negative energy you encounter with the customers over the phone. At the beginning of 2015 many co-workers suffered from heart attacks and even died because of the high level of stressing following the launch of the CSG conversion.",Comcast

Accolade health assistance is an amazing service that will locate doctors and specialists for you, and they even offer your own personal nurse to offer advice on medical issues. Free cable and internet is nice, but you're still required to pay for the equipment.","First: In regards to the free cable and internet. Because you are an employee of Comcast and no longer considered a customer, any repair requests or changes that you may have, even if it's equipment related, which you are required to pay for can take several weeks to complete. Courtesy Services does not work quickly at all when it comes to employee repair issues. Second: In regards to the job itself. I was hired for video repair. Now, I'm not idiot, so I assumed being a multiple service provider, some upselling and upgrading would probably be required, however, this is not the case. You don't find out until your SECOND day of employment (first day is orientation), which is your first official day of training that your primary goal is sales. It doesn't matter how mad the customer is, how many missed appointments they've had, or how many times they've flat out been lied to by other reps, you're still required to try to get a new line of service on them. An elderly lady calls you because her DTA ($1.99 basic cable box) doesn't work and says there's an interruption in service (more so than not, this means the box is bad and needs to be replaced), and while discussing the situation she happens to state she's on a limited income and can't afford a technician to come out and replace the box (free if it's the equipment, $39.95 if it's ANYTHING else), if you don't want it get scolded by management, you better try to sell her digital voice, or internet. She has a DTA? Better try to get her up to either a Digital set top box so she can get On Demand, or better yet, Just get her into an HD Triple Play package. I feel absolutely mislead about the job I interviewed and was eventually hired for. Had I known it was a driven primarily by sales, I never would have accepted the position in the first place. Third: Career Advance Path (or, how to keep you in one spot until you can be replaced by trainees, because they trainees will be paid $11.00 USD per hour starting and can be easily replaced). This path was setup as a way to ""promote"" from within based on how hard you want to work and prove your worth to the company. You have 6 months from your hire date to go from CAE: Level 1 Representative to CAE: Level 2 Associate. This comes with a $1.00 USD pay increase. The problem with this are the metrics involved. While you are required to meet four of the metrics for promotion, I will focus on the three that are almost impossible. The first is TSRs, those are your sales, but not just sales. They have to be new lines of service. That means if someone only has cable, you better sell them internet, or phone. If you can sell a triple play, then you get 2 TSRs. You have to meet a percentage of 0.58% (absolute bare minimum) of sales on all of your total calls. On average, you can take 600 or more calls per fiscal month. 0.58% doesn't sound like much at all, especially over the course of 600 or more calls, right? Well that's 34.8 new lines of service. Now 600 is a high number. That would be on a very high call volume month. More accurately, you're probably going to take between 400 and 500 calls, so the number of TSRs required will raise or drop based on the number of calls you take per week, per month. The next metric that really matters is called VOC: Voice of the Customer. Ever call Comcast and while you're waiting for a rep, the recording asks you if they can call you back to take a brief survey about your experience? That's what VOC is to employees. By default, you start at 100% monthly. Now, if you can maintain 100% per month, that pretty much just means that out of all of your calls, everyone opted out of that survey, so there was nothing to bring it down. While this survey is meant to be a way of the customer to give their opinion as to how I the representative helped you, most look at it as a reflection of the company, and oddly enough, we have a running slogan at Comcast, ""No one is calling to tell you how happy they are with the service"" and that's the truth. Unless during the survey, when given the opportunity, the customer actually records a voice message stating the rep they spoke to did an amazing job, anything negative that they report about Comcast directly reflects on the rep themselves, even if we successfully helped you. The customer is never made aware of this. The final metric I want to discuss is called FCR: First Call Resolution. What this means to the rep is as follows. Say you're a Comcast customer and you're having issues with your video (since I only worked in video) and you call in and select the video option and get me. I have two options at my disposal. First and foremost, I want to troubleshoot the problem, because in most situations, the problem can be resolved by sending a refresh signal to your defective box (unless you have a DTA with a blinking light. If that light is blinking, you need your box replaced 9 times out of 10). After sending the refresh signal, we will ask you to disconnect the power to your faulty box for about 20 to 30 seconds then plug it back in. After a reboot process from the box, in most circumstances, your services will be restored. If these steps do not work, we have on other option, we send a technician out to your house. Now, we will tell you that if the problem is with the equipment, the service call is free, and this is true, however, the technicians have quotas to meet as well and more so than not, a tech will tell you there is a wiring problem and tell you that you either need to add a Service Protection Plan (Insurance for your cable lines that runs between $3.95 USD and $4.95 USD per month based on whatever market you're in) to prevent you from having to pay the $39.95 USD technician fee. If you don't want that option, we can then tell you to return the faulty box to a local service center (expect about a two hour wait) to replace the equipment, but if you bring that box home and it doesn't work, guess what? You now have something called a Failed Self Install, and regardless of your protection plan, it will not cost you $39.95 USD to have the tech come out and fix it. Assume that I did fix your problem though, but you call back in 4 days later over a billing issue, if you either just hit 0 to talk to someone quickly in hopes of not waiting, you will get routed back to a repair department, if you happen to get video (we have a 7 day window before our FCRs are considered good and we're credited for them), but tell me on the phone that you need to get to billing. Through no fault of your own, other than wanting a rep quickly, you just caused me to get a negative mark on my FCR, simply because you came through on the video queue instead of going through the billing queue. Then, as an added bonus, I'm slapped with a negative transfer rate, because we're not supposed to transfer calls. When you combine just these three of the four metrics that we are required to meet for advancement to level 2 (you're terminated after six months if you've not attained three consecutive months of meeting and exceeding the four primary metrics. UNLESS of course, you have good sales and don't really do anything else. Then they're more than happy to break that rule for you and keep you on the phones with the promise of having you restart the Career Advance Path again for another six months. Your shifts are not determined by seniority either. They are determined by sales alone. Those with low sales work the worst shifts, which basically means there is no such thing as ever seeing your family again if you wish to stay employed in a Comcast call center. Also...those metrics have to be met in order for you to even transfer to another department like Com tech, or dispatch. ONE MORE VERY IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE: If you are a Comcast customer reading this and you demand to speak to a supervisor, there are two things you should know. We are required to do our best to prevent that transfer, even if it means telling you that they can't do anything different than we can. We are REQUIRED to de-escalate the call at all costs, even if that means lying to you to do so. Also, if you are one of the lucky ones that gets to a speak to a a supervisor, (this happens generally when someone has had several missed appointments by technicians, which by the way, get cancelled for no reason at all. Sometimes, they're cancelled, strictly because the tech didn't want to do the job that day, or could get something else done more quickly. When they tell you that you will receive a call 30 minutes prior to their arrival, you probably won't, but if they do call and you somehow miss the call, but call them back, they will not answer and they will move on to the next job. Your account will be marked as ""Cust Not Home""), you're probably not talking to a supervisor. More than likely you just got transferred to a rep just like me who tells you that he's a supervisor and then repeats the exact same thing that I just told you before the transfer. Supervisors do take calls from time to time, but it's only at designated times and only for a limited amount of time. Normally about an hour to an hour and a half. Just know, that if you're asking for a supervisor, more than likely the rep just put you on hold, leaned over to his neighbor (providing that the neighbor is authorized to take those calls) and says ""Hey, can you jump in iChat for a second, they need a supervisor"". Then we'll discuss over the partition everything that I just told you, so he knows what to say to you.",Comcast

You need to bring in 30,000.00 monthly revenue in order to receive your commission.

IMO if a person is sick or has a legitimate reason to miss work a company that size needs to address it without threatening termination. The truth is that in most states a person can be fired at any time for any or no reason. So when a manager says that it is usually with the intent of coercively controlling you.

Some leaders are not held to the same expectations as we are as reps and it's frustrating to see reps written up or let go for things that we see leaders do out on the floor, (such as full blown tantrums, insubordination to their leader, defiance, etc.) Need to be given designated time to complete online courses we sign up for ourselves and not just given time to complete the mandatory ones or the suggested ones in our learning plan.

The benefits are decent.,"It now takes 6 months to a year to move up each level to get more money as oppose to the 1-6 months it use to take to move up each level. The metrics you have to meet to move up have become very high as well plus your supervisor has to like you enough to feel you are ready to move up. They are still in the business of rushing their technicians to make time frames and have high production with ""good"" quality which leads to a lot of skipped breaks and sometimes even a half lunch if we get one at all. If you do work there, gain the favor of the boss and just mimic what they do if they were a technician even if it is not with the best interest of the customer. Its about finishing out jobs quickly here, not so much customer satisfaction.You don't have days off as well since if someone calls in on you for whatever reason, even if not cable related, you get a bad mark on your metrics therefore making it harder for you to move up. They claim they do not count it against you, if it is not workmanship, but they do. This makes it harder for you to make your metrics and in turn harder to get paid more. When you reach your higher amount of money as a technician you have to befriend management to keep your job long enough to get fired before retirement which I have seen them do to older technicians. Tech's are just numbers to them, literally. We have technician numbers with metrics beside them. The technicians that I have heard of that did that were actually good were let go for whatever reason they may have seen fit. Good tech's, good people. Just not up to the speed of what the company wanted. If you look up Comcast under Forbes, they are the worst known for customer satisfaction in 2014 and being a tech there, I can see why unfortunately. Everyone in the middle are less stressed, but underpaid for the work they do so if they are ok with the smaller pay then it is a little more stressful than the worst or the best technicians. Management looks at the poor customer satisfaction and lack of quality work done on the first visit as ""job security"". Not really customer driven at all unless a customer complains, especially on You Tube. I only stay here because the money is good enough, but the customer loyalty and the opportunity for growth for good tech's are lacking.

Work load is really large within the time constraints given by the company. Communication is rather slow from the field upwards. Advancement is weird.

The company stopped putting any faith into troubleshooting abilities of their agents and mandated use of a line-of-questioning as the only way we were allowed to help customers. Essentially you become an interactive script and even if you can see in your notes or diagnostics what the customer's issue is, you are not allowed to simply take the proper step to fix it, you must ask the customer irrelevant questions and fill out the ticket. You are no longer able to even send a simple refresh signal to a piece of equipment without ""permission,"" from their line-of-questions system. This system was full of bugs and feedback and bug-reporting were ignored for months at a time, only then to receive a stock reply of ""we are working on it,"" or the ticket being rejected as a ""duplicate,"" but with no resolution. Despite the amount of time you were forced to waste in this system, the metric of how long you can have a customer on the phone for was never adjusted to compensate. The system essentially nullified any need for training as anything you learned in training was no longer useful - you could only say and do what was on your screen. You essentially become an automated system with slightly better voice recognition. I truly believe the overall goal of this is to reduce training costs. Before this system, new agents spent six weeks in training. Comcast call centers have a huge turnover rate, so the cost of training is fairly significant. Eliminating the need for training, even at the cost of a far, far, inferior customer experience seems to be preferable. This will make employees more expendable and help with costs related to the turnover rate. No competent person stays at Comcast long because the pay is not worth the environment and the way you are treated. I think it's very sad Comcast thinks this is a better solution than fixing the things that make people quit and hiring competent people who can troubleshoot effectively without literally being told what to do, step-by-step, real-time. While paid time off seemed generous, the fact that an unscheduled absence for *any reason,* was considered ""unacceptable,"" offset that significantly. T-Boned on your lunchbreak? Unacceptable; point. Death of a close family member who does not meet their strict criteria of ""immediate?"" Unacceptable; point for any time missed as a result. They give you what they call ""flex-waives,"" which, in reality, are what other companies call ""personal days."" The difference is they are used as excuses to not waive any absence for any reason beyond those 4 ""flex-waives, regardless of what documentation and you may have and regardless of the situation. It is normal to take the unfavored shift when starting with an employer, but at Comcast, I was stuck with it. 1-Midnight, including weekends. Despite the fact that their was a shift bid 5 months after we started, we were not allowed to participate. My numbers were good and I looked forward to getting a more manageable shift. They were using 3 months of scorecard data to calculate rank. While we had 3 months of data, the range they defined included one month for which we were not on the phone. It would have been very easy to slide that date range to let us participate in the bid. There were a number of ways to let us participate, but they chose not too. Seniority is only 30% of the bid, it is supposed to be based on performance but despite being a top-performer I was stuck for a year working 1pm-Midnight because it was easier for them logistically. Benefits were quite expensive compared to other Fortune 500s and for slightly worse coverage. Many promised benefits were not possible to take advantage of. They supposedly have a system where Comcast will pay for certain IT courses and you pay for the testing to get a certificate. This was a key point for me in my interview, and it was glorified during training when they indoctrinate about how amazing Comcast is. For 3 months I tried to coordinate taking advantage of this program, I involved multiple supervisors, a manager, and they worked with HR. Supervisor and manager had never heard of it, I sent screenshots of the company intranet discussing exactly how to take advantage of it, they worked with HR, and nothing ever happened. I was emailing often to check on progress and simply getting the run-around, it was completely impossible to use.",Comcast

What's worse is this is the worst communicating company I've ever worked for bar none. So with this combination Comcast across the board spends a disproportionate amount of time and resources misfiring causing customer aggravation, constant employee churn, and they unnecessarily burn through resources and customers like they have them to spare. As an employee it's ungodly frustrating to work for a company that has no interest in providing you (the employee) the tools and resources you need on a daily basis to create a positive experience for your internal and external customers. I have to literally fight my employer (Comcast) DAILY to get what I need to service their customers. Training is entirely inadequate for company employees. This is the reason when you call Comcast it depends on who you get as to what kind of service quality you receive. It's basically up to the person to train themselves, or don't. Comcast doesn't care and they won't fire anyone for poor performance (no accountability). That … and the fact that there are more contract workers here than there are actual company employees and the contract workers have zero accountability. The further up the leadership chain you go, the more disconnected they are from what's going on at your level. The problem is this is where all the decisions are made and handed down to your level.

The companies sales process is so extremely dysfunctional that it takes hours and hours out of your day instead of selling. This truly creates a 60-70 hour work week. On top of that, the front end sales numbers (I.e., prospecting and cold calling) is enormous (25 initial appointments per month with clients you have never met with before). This is Enterprise also, so the MAJORITY of people you contact would not have a need for Enterprise-level products. Management is high pressure and in my experience uses bullying tactics and fear mongering in order for people to work harder. The reality is in the numbers. When I was there (18 month tenure), there was only around 4-5 out of 27 reps that were at quota (!!!). That is a terribly low number of reps making quota, considering that the sales force is comprised of very smart people, most of whom has 10++ years of sales experience. Simply not acceptable. Comcast is so huge that they lost their eyes completely on customer service. They create issues with their horrific\bizarre\dysfunctional sales process and stick their customers in the middle of it.

I'm not at all surprised. I was so embarrassed by the company's consistently ill treatment of it's customers, that I left after just a few short months. Comcast's callous disregard is not reserved only for the welfare of it's customers, but extends to the sales force as well. New employees at my location were given impossible territories while veterans were allowed to cherry pick and use banned selling tactics. Shady business practices are overlooked by management as long as results are achieved, all the while being constantly reminded via memos and meetings that such practices are not allowed. This is done so that any time one of these shady deals goes wrong, the sales person can be thrown under the bus and management can claim they didn't know what was happening. Customer service is absolutely embarrassing. You're told to promise customers the moon to get them to sign a contract and tell them they can call you if they have any problems. When they do inevitably have problems, the company won't help the customer. The customer calls you for help. As their sales person, you call the customer service on their behalf to find that they won't help you either! You're usually referred back to your manager who is busy selling himself, and has no interest at all in helping your customer. Worse than that, my manager would say it was taken care of - which I would pass on to the customer, and then nothing would change. The net effect is that you look like a big liar. You tell your customer you're taking care of their issues, and then it doesn't happen even though you've gone through all the proper channels --- over, and over and over. While you're wrestling with that mess and trying to keep from having all your sales cancelled, you're expected to be out selling new contracts all day.

Comcast pays a lot more than other telecommunication companies for the direct sales position. I My love my immediate supervisor and really like my team members. It is a very relaxed atmosphere and great place to make a career. Great benefits package (Health, Dental, Vision, Prescription, Short term/Long term disability, Supplemental insurance, life insurance, 401 k, discounted stock options, multiple stock options, discounted cable, discounts towards Universal Studios tickets, etc.) They match your 401 k contributions up to 4.5% of your income which is outstanding. Also, very generous holiday, vacation, flex, floating holiday and other time off schedule. Full time employees start with 1 week of paid vacation (based on your previous years earnings to calculate your hourly) after the first 90 days of probation. After 5 years of employment, it will increase to 2 weeks and up to three weeks after ten. Also, in my experience race, gender, etc. does not play a part as most of the my team members and immediate higher ups are considered to be minority. I believe that Comcast genuinely cares about its employees. They are always asking, surveying how they are doing and what can be done to foster a better atmosphere. There is an open door policy and all employees have access to HR and Comcast Listens which allows for anonymous whistle blowing or sharing of other concerns.","Comcast is too big for its own good. The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. Even though each department has put emphasis on their own teams, they do not communicate and cooperate effectively with other departments to streamline the processes and offer better internal/external customer service experience. Even though are sales channel is paid generously, the same cannot be said of other departments which could lead to low employee morale and performance. This explains why Comcast consistently ranks on the bottom of JD Power customer service rankings for telecom providers. Also, most of Comcast's training is via Comcast University which is done online by the employee. Even though virtual setting has its advantages (cost/resources), it fails to adequately prepare some employees for their specific job. For example, in the sales arena, there are a million online modules that will teach an employee about tech., brand, etc. but fail to teach actual sales training.

A LOT of red tape if you want to help a customer out. Customer service is a joke. I deal with customers everyday who say the exact same thing - call center support is of very little help.

If you aren't up for lots of knocks on doors, lots of rejection and being watched--walk away from this job, it just isn't for you. Super high pressure sales job. Two months of not meeting quota=no more job. Upper management is completely disconnected with the sales force. Expect to work in all weather--management will. Unless there is a weather emergency, you are expected to work. (Outdoors, knocking on residential houses for new business.) Micromanagement to the max. GPS tracking on your company supplied Ipad, all company supplied phone calls recorded, all customer contacts expected to be recorded. If you don't like being monitored, this definitely isn't for you. Expect the whole office to know if you haven't made your numbers. Management loves to shame those who are having difficulty. Customer service for the purpose of referrals used to be expected. Now it is forbidden. The turn of the new year (to 2014) has shown lots of changes. No more good promotions (incentives for the customers to buy from you vs. the call center where you don't get credit for the sale). Higher deposits for new customers. Cut in pay if you get a referral (not worth as much to the company, apparently)...so another reason to pay you less. Commissions are frequently wrong. More time out of your week to make sure you get paid correctly--expect it to be a battle. The finance people look for reasons to pay you less, and they will if you let them. Overall--used to be a great job a year ago. Not so much anymore. My personal opinion--Comcast is getting ready to end this division through two ways: 1.) Make it impossible for reps to reach quota, thus they didn't do their job. Zero cost to eliminate that employee. 2.) Make the reps want to quit. Even better for Comcast.",Comcast

The agents I worked with really cared about getting customers' equipment/services working, but Comcast corporate does not share that same outlook. Comcast pushes their repair agents to sell, sell, sell, and that is where the other 10% comes in - to meet the unrealistic metrics of their repair center, some agents feel the pressure to add services to customer's accounts without their knowledge. Comcast does nothing about this - just as long as you are selling. You are given very little repair training in their 6-week training course, which is a joke. During training, Comcast brings in Supervisors from the floor to talk about their great Comcast experiences. They come in all smiles, helpful, friendly - but when you get on the floor - no more smiles or helpfulness. You are informed in training that if you EVER need to go to the bathroom go - but once on the floor - you get an IM from several Supervisors asking you to take your bathroom breaks on your own time. Which if you start work at 1pm and your first break isn't until 3:45pm makes it a bit difficult to hold. You get consistently scolded for going to the bathroom or helping out another agent because ""Aux"" time is way more important (FCC rules - so they say) than your well being or helping a co-worker. There is no consistency on the floor. Some agents get by with sleeping at their desks and then others like me, just wanting to go to bathroom - gets a written warning. Also, they give you 10 minutes to start your computer and all of the necessary programs to do your job. This takes a full 10 minutes. Then Comcast does not give you the opt. to review emails, service updates, trending logs, important information to do your job effectively. Instead, they demand you do this on ""YOUR OWN TIME"", so basically you are working overtime, without the pay - the last I remember, this was ""illegal"". I brought this to the attention of the director & vp of Comcast - was told to ""read quickly"". Once I informed Comcast of this, is when I began receiving IMs from Supervisors about going to the bathroom. They pushed me out the door with their harassment.

7395,"""Great company that lost site of its employees""",3.0,"Very good benefits, reduced rates for cable products, offices everywhere if relocation is an issue","Over the past 5 years Comcast has looked at the bottom line regardless of facts. A couple of examples: Customer Service agents have their phone calls monitored for time and count. Supervisors look at these (among other) numbers to determine if employee is meeting the days numbers. No where does it record if problems are actually solved. WAY too often the agents rushes people off the phone without correcting a problem that would have taken them beyond the expected time limit. This infuriates customers as anyone who has Comcast can attest. The agents who take the time to make sure the problems are corrected go over the limit, don't get as many calls completed and, without recourse, get denied a raise. The Technicians have it much the same way. A tech is given an average of 60 minutes to go to a house, identify the problem and correct it. Oh yes, and check everything else in the house to make sure the customer does not have to call again for a repeat trouble call. In a new construction home, this is fine. In a 50 year old home with old wires that need replacing, the job could take four hours. Do it right.....no raise. Do it fast, customer calls back and the Tech gets a repeat....no raise. Comcast recently had many long time employees in Customer Care ( many supervisors) have to re-apply for their jobs. Many did not get re-hired. The environment is one that, even most supervisors, feel that every day could be their last. It is an extremely stressful job at every level. A few years ago the numbers guy in our office actually asked the technicians how long it took to walk from their morning meetings to their trucks. Really?????

There is a revolving door mentality in management. There is NO job security. From the day that job training is completed, there is the constant threat of termination, even for washroom usage. Stress comes not only from management but customers as well, who constantly complain about the companies business practices. Employees can't even make plans w/family because of the system set in place for scheduled time off. In most cases, you don't know until the day OF whether requested time off was approved or not. Employees are REQUIRED on every call to promote & sell additional products & services to customers but the company keeps changing the employee commission structure so employees are required to sell morre & more with less & less commission compensation.",Comcast

I put about 20k in 6 months. When i worked out the math i saw that i was basically spending over $1,000 in gas per month for work expenses, not to mention car depreciation etc etc. I calculated it to about subtracting $10k to $15k from your total earnings to accommodate gas and wear and tear, which when i made $70k, 55k to 60k wasn't worth the difficulty of the position during the winter when people come home at 5pm and it gets dark at 6pm. you have to knock doors in the cold and in the dark untill about 7 or 8 pm, the cold you can deal with, but people in general are not receptive at door to door sales people, and in the dark it is a completely different animal. you may find an occasional person, but it is brutal going through neighborhoods in the dark knocking on their doors selling them cable. And if you don't then you have very little chance of making any commission. The summer time i found to be amazing, it got dark later, you had more time to make sales then, so my advice is summers you need to give it everything you have and then some, and plan your vaca's during the winter to give yourself some breaks during the toughest part of the year.

Customer assistance fell by the wayside when we would no longer support half the equipment that we provided subscribers (ie routers, gateway systems and phone products). The same time the training for the job was getting less and less for any new products, it would get so bad that you would be asked by the customer how a certain new product worked and it would be something that you hadn't even heard about. When training was offered it was months after the fact, and rushed also to get a whole days training into a 45 min session. Last year my former tech support department was dissolved locally and moved to a different city so I was offered to reskill to stay local or commute. I reskilled, the reskill training was no better, anyone coming from tech department to the retention department previously would go throught a 6 week training program going over all types of things, we were given a week training and most of the time it was making posters and different signs not doing any real sales training or anything really pertinent to the job. After this for about 2 months I was sat with a supervisor that did nothing to help me to transition to this new position that I feel was forced on me. All around me people who know their job are being replaced by people who do not, and are giving out false and incorrect information. Now I am being told that the new people off the street are getting the sales training that was denied to me and others. Wouldn't it make sence to invest in your long time employees since they know the products like the back of thier hand. My voice of the customer rating is constistently at or around 100% and that means absolutely nothing now since now matter how happy they are with me if I dont sell them something else on top of what they have then I get knocked down regardless. If someone calls in now to lower ther bill and you are able to keep the services they have and RETAIN them as a customer it still means nothing since you didn't up their bill with another service that they don't want. Most people who get on my phone called a few days before and were charged something that they don't need or want to get a rep's commision higher and then I have to remove it to keep a customer or they will cancel. So at that point my stats go down lower so I can maintain my own ethical morals to help someone. I am currently looking for another place of employment so that I am not forced to undermine my own credibility by continually lying to the customer about not being able to help them save moeny when I see a lower price but giving this to them means cutting my nose off. To top it off with my seniority at the company my pay rate was cut down from around 18$ to 12$ so that I could stay local in a new department and seniority here means next to nothing anymore since restructuring the more sales you push the more say you have, leaving me and others like me just wallowing in the shadows.",Comcast

There are many great people to work and interact with, and most make an effort to be a part of the many company sponsored events like baseball outings, bowling, trivia nights, summer picnics and catered lunches which make for a fun and interactive culture. The open door policy also allows for direct interaction and conversations with executive team who encourage feedback and new ideas.","While the focus on product development makes for an exciting environment, it can often lead to a complicated set of system dependencies, tight deadlines, and choosing new features over the stability of a product. There is also a tendency to overcommit to customers in terms of timelines and cost which often leads to constantly changing priorities as well as emergency fixes and deployments that might otherwise have been avoided. Quite often large initiatives get implemented in parallel without a good understanding of the resources needed to bring them to market in a way that's sustainable.

In the call center there was a clear and achievable path to move up levels and get very good raises. That became non-existant as the goals become unattainable. Retaliatory actions by supervisory and management staff to subordinates is just horrific. If a supervisor or management staff member doesn't like you for whatever reason, there is a good chance they will do whatever they can to fire you or at the very least, make your life a living hell. They hire people with no business serving customers which is why their support can be so awful for customers. Every singe phone rep is now required to sell and troubleshoot every service even though most were only brought in and trained to do one. Dispatch is a nightmare and the good field techs are far outweighed by contractors who do a piss-poor job most of the time. Hours are horrible to start and even as you go up in tenure, they still have crap schedules for all but the most seasoned of front line employees. Entire departments are let go without any warning or notice. They will fight every single unemployment claim no matter what the reason of job loss. They have replaced every HR rep that cared about the employees with ones that work to protect the company. A monopoly in so many areas. I loved this job when I began in 2003 and in the first few years it was a great place to work. The community was strong and management cared about their staff. Once they required all supervisors and management to put in 60 hour work weeks minimum (once you go salary you become their slave) that all changed. Every supervisor who actually cared about their team and questioned the horrible decisions made by upper management were either fired or their jobs become a living hell due to the aforementioned retaliatory actions.

This is a job where literally every second of your day at work can be and is electronically monitored -- this is because you ""punch in"" to the work day by logging in to your telephone headset. Computers track in real time not just for your immediate supervisor but across the call center how long you are on a call with every single customer (if you go over a certain time while helping a customer and your supervisor arbitrarily decides today is the day to crack down on that you will receive an IM about it in real time to get off). Your breaks thus are logged and monitored in real time down to the second. The calls are back-to-back from the time of your first phone call to the last. There are people who do not believe there are such Orwellian jobs or technology yet where an employee's ""productivity"" can be monitored in real time by the second and acted on, but anyone in service-industry type jobs just above the fast-food level or big-box-store level knows this is very much the reality (warehouse employees for online sellers, for example, also are tracked for their productivity from the moment they electronically check in through every single item they scan and package and how many seconds it takes them to reach another bin, etc.). All of this is before you even get to the ridiculous quotas, also monitored and tracked in real time electronically, but many other posters already have hit on that. Your corporate identity is 100 percent numbers 100 percent of the time. But at least it's a job. The single most frustrating thing is that Comcast issues deliberately contradictory pricing information to call center employees and that it provides a single day of training on troubleshooting and resolving issues that 99 percent of customers calling into the call center are trying to resolve (one day out of two months of training is devoted to troubleshooting; the rest is devoted to sales). The contradictory pricing information and constantly changing basic Comcast corporate policies are not just bad communications -- they are deliberate. The contradictory information means that any given customer calling in will get a different answer on pricing from every single person he/she speaks to, and it's totally a crapshoot whether the person seeking help with the service will actually have the issue resolved. The contradictory information often flies in the face of what even the supervisors of the front-line call center employees might have repeatedly said is the policy over the course of a year -- literally overnight front-line call center employees and their supervisors will learn that what they've been doing all along to follow the rules and keep their jobs isn't just a little bit different than what the corporate policy really is but 100 percent the opposite, and a bunch of coworkers in one fell swoop in one day will be fired to underscore the seriousness of their infraction. I don't know why upper management operates in such a way -- there will always be a few longtime devoted great employees caught in the mass firings -- but it almost has to be budgetary (the call center needs to make its own quotas) and arbitrarily overnight changing policies and saying that's been the policy all along allow the company to cite a reason for an abrupt mass firing. The employees really are just endless set of numbers and mathematical calculations on a computer screen. So. Welcome to Comcast.",Comcast

The complimentary services (extended basic video and basic high speed internet) are great if you live in a Comcast serviced area. You save money since you will not have to pay for services for which you are probably already using.","Comcast production jobs: field technician support, general customer service, billing, retention, dispatch, telephony order management, and collections all had quotas which require the Comcast employees to process a certain minimum number of inbound calls, outbound calls, or repair trouble tickets within 5-8 minutes which can be unrealistic depending on the nature of the trouble or customer issue. The call center sales reps have only five minutes to sell video, telephony, and high speed internet services to each customer. Now, how can anyone explain the features and prices for three products in less than five minutes to customers who may not want to switch their telephone and internet services? When I was a telephony day of install agent, many times I had to wait for the EMTA (Embedded Multimedia Terminal Adapter), aka Comcast telephone box, to boot-up which could take 2-3 minutes thus cutting into my call quota time. Sometimes, I had to upgrade the firmware for the installed EMTA and that took 6-minutes. I know many of my co-workers would would perform incomplete installations to maintain their call quota times and production numbers thus many field technicians had to call back 2-3 times for troubleshooting help to complete their installations. Due to the nature of Comcast's services, customer service related and field technician support related work is seven-days a week so forget about Saturday and Sundays off. Do not count on job security. Comcast has outsourced telephony installation support work to the Philippines and they have transferred collections work from Livermore, CA to somewhere in Utah. The transferring of work outside California or outside the United States does not lower the cost of services to consumers or increase Comcast employee wages, rather the management decisions are to help increase investment returns to stockholders.",Comcast

For those of you who don't know what this means in real terms, the translation is eliminated jobs. All the media sees (and therefore the bulk of the population) is that we are adding heads . . . not across the board but only in call centers, and many of those aren't even in our own country where we could use them. With every efficiency achieved re-orgs have been taking place. Many people who have been folded into new teams now feel like the communication is non-existant, deemed unessential or dictatorial. Their suggestions as to how to improve the processes or performance now fall on deaf ears. Politics plays a role in these reorgs, geographic areas are staked out and the race is on to see who can build the biggest empire. Meanwhile employee enthusiasm and the can-do spirit has been squelched.

The communication level of this company is laughable. I get at least a few calls a week from customers asking about a new product or promotion that they've seen commercials about or received a mailer about that none of us in the call center has even heard of. The front-line representatives always seem to be the last to know about many things in this company. Just a day or two ago, a couple of co-workers of mine and I were getting calls about one of the service centers being boarded up... none of us had any idea what was going on or why the store was closed. A FULL day later, we get a hastily put together e-mail stating that the store was closed for business... then a day after that another email was sent with the date that the store would be reopening. Really? What am I supposed to tell my customer? Make something up so that I can get them off of the phone within the 6 minutes we're allotted for each call before our ""numbers"" are affected? The expectations and goals set by the higher-ups are ridiculous... and the crazy thing is that they wouldn't be completely ridiculous if we were provided with the correct tools to handle our customers. But instead, Comcast just drops their front-line employees in a rowboat with no paddles, in the middle of the ocean. We don't even have estimated time of resolution 98% of the time when an outage occurs. And what takes the cake... in the past year or so, someone came up with the great idea of adding customer surveys that call the customer back after ending the call.. and these surveys make up part of the scorecard that grades your overall performance. In theory, this would be a good idea... but when you don't provide your employees with the correct tools to assist your customers, it's a recipe for disaster. Most of the people choose ratings on the survey based on how upset they are with Comcast.. not because their interaction with the representative was unsatisfactory. But that doesn't matter... your score is in the toilet because Comcast can't get their act together. Supervisors don't want to take calls when a customer requests to speak with a supervisor... instead they halfway listen to you explain what the issue is and then tell you what to say to the customer. WHAT? You can only imagine the position this puts the representative in... you already have someone on the phone who no longer wants to speak with you, but NOW.. you have the audacity to not honor their simple request... and keep feeding them BS.

In all the companies I have worked for not one of them offers paid time off for when you are sick without it ALWAYS taking away from your Vacation time, and few have offered two weeks vacation in your first year. Comcast does not penalize you for having multiple children, no matter how many kids you have your insurance remains the same. People tend to get angry because they use all their flex (sick) time for pleasure and then get written up because they actually get sick and have no time left. I personally have needed to call out with zero notice twice since I've been with the company, and in neither case have I been written up. I think that the policy of calling out once in any rolling 30 days is completely rational, and of course if you don't agree with it you're tied to no contract so pack your desk and get out. Be greatful you have a job, you weren't guaranteed today, wake up glad you've got at least a few breaths left and take the call, that all be it miserable, is your call; look at the bright side you're getting complained to, or about, but knowing you did your best should be enough to satisfy you. Is it frustrating at times to work here, sure, but they call it work for a reason, I don't look at my wife and say ""I'm off to fun sweetheart,"" I say I'm off to work. So to wrap it up I'll say this is the job at times miserable, absolutely, but the main catalyst of this misery is employees that refuse to recognize a good thing when they have it. Comcast offers a great tuition reimbursment program, haven't seen much about that, two weeks PAID vacation in your first year, 8 PAID flex/sick days, and people complain, why, well simply put it's because they can't get their priorities straight. If you use a flex day for a hangover that's your ignorance, you knew you had to work the next day when you took that first drink, or stayed up late just to hang out and were too tired to work.

People call in and hang up, call from the wrong market, unauthorized people call in to ask misc questions, your own collection, billing and repair reps call you to ask questions, people that are having a missed install date and time, people that just want to talk to a live person that have a billing or repair issue call you… all of these calls count against you and if you work later in the day (after 7:00pm) they become the majority of the calls. If you don’t make close rate or revenue for a month, but you destroy the production numbers (phone Tv (D1) and internet) then you still get written up and threaten to be fired. This means they are going to get rid of you in 2 months. The company has to go through all checks and balances to show that they give everyone an opportunity. I understand this concept, its something we learned about at college. You don’t want to pay full time employees, so you add in metrics that don’t mean anything so you can turn them. The new employees wont have bennies for 90 days and it saves the company money because they can higher at the lowest wage. I was encouraged by two supervisors to stay off the phone as much as possible after 7:00 pm because it hurt my close rate. Or to stay on an individual call as long as possible. This tells me that they know the system is flawed.

There are always internal feuds going on throughout all levels of management with different branches of the organization fighting for control. Major re-orgs happen once a year, which only adds to the chaos. No matter what you may think, Comcast is not a software company, and not even an engineering company. They are an operations company first and foremost. This trait is something you see throughout the cable industry because most people who work there came from support and operations and have little to no experience with engineering, architecture, and software projects. Because of the operations mentality the company has a very rigid culture of blame and shifting responsibility. When there is a problem, the first question is always not ""how do we fix it?"" but rather ""who can we blame for this?"" Additionally, because they are an operations-minded shop everyone is very resistive to change and it usually takes weeks to agree on anything or get anything done. Much of the management at this company make your average DBA look like a risk-taker. The pay was crap, but I also know people who made good money there. The one common thing was that once you accept a job you don't get good raises or promotions, other than nominal title changes, and even those are hard to come by.

They offer over 5500$ per year in tuition reimbursement but how do you go to college if you never know when you will be out of work. Kind of tough to schedule classes around that. Big disconnect between what is taught in training and what goes on in the field. Almost everything they told us not to do in training is being done in the field so that people can try to get off somewhere near on time. Also, they spend a lot of time in training telling us how to smile , tuck our shirts in and things like that, but some portions of training were way to short. Internet installs are a big part of the job but we get about 2 days of training on that. Not nearly enough.

From its routes as a family owned monopoly cable company, Comcast has grown to become a multi-product communication and entertainment company with strong competition in every facet of its business. Unfortunately, the company leadership failed to recognize the need to become customer focused or customer friendly. And in some ways, Comcast remains a family company - albeit a dysfunctional one. There is a core group of ""in"" people ""the family"" and if you are not part of that group it can be difficult to advance. And once somebody acheives ""in status"" they become barriers to change working very hard to make sure they and their friends do not get tarnished with bad news. The few who do tell the truth - competition is growing or customer satisfaction is non existent - run the risk of being alienated. Unfortunately, this has lead to a culture of ""no bad news"" or ""figure out how to blame someone else"". We sometimes wondered if Brian Roberts was getting the whole truth.",Comcast

I know that Comcast is filled with a lot of dedicated, passionate great people and that is another reason it is Comcastic!!!","Some of the downsides of working for Comcast is what draws a lot of people to the company, their size. Comcast is a huge nationwide employeer with vast opportunities for growth and movement within the company. Because of that, a lot of people have been employed there for a long time and therefore, advancement opportunities don't come around as often as you might hope.

Comcast Supervisors avoid assisting customers and discourage seeking a supervisor for escalated issues. Their practice was to have the rep log a supervisor ticket to return the customers call and no one would get back to the customers. This only made matters worse and resulted in customers repeatedly calling back angry. The call metrics are completely unattainable across the board and the system almost guarantees failure, atleast for those who are not favorites. There are about 20-25 different metrics reps need to reach but its not possible due to various uncontrollable factors. If you resolve a difficult issue your call time will go up which is a negative, if your call time is too low this is also a negative. Even if a call goes well and the customer is satisfied but later calls back because they had an unrelated question or simply wanted to make a payment etc this too will count as a negative as it is considered a repeat call. The metric system is inherently flawed because if you excel in some areas you will not be reaching metrics in other areas due to the system and uncontrollable factors. The environment is very oppressive and extremely restrictive. I understand having controls in place, however, the environment handcuffs your ability to do a great job for the customer.

There does not seem to be a clearly defined IT department to maintain the PCs at the call center, only one desktop tech is at the call center to repair the PCs.

8525,"""Comcast""",4.0,"The upper upper management-- in Philly- knows how to run a business. Comcast is no-nonsense: they intend to make money and see that the employees share in the rewards to a reasonable degree. Best quality is it has risen rapidly enough that it still has a small-company, family-business mind-set even though it has mushroomed into a giant corporation. Brian Roberts, son of legendary founder, Ralph Roberts, runs it, and his top man is Steve Burke. Both are superb leaders and businessmen. Their business philosophy has been company decentralization, with the various systems and regional divisions across the country left to figure out their own approach to a significant degree. This has slowed down bureaucratization and sameness, and has fostered a relative of diversity styles and approaches. The benefit for the employee is a relative lack of stifling generalities rolling mindlessly down from a peak populated by a bland egocentric corporate kingpin. There is something still amateurish , naive, and sincere about the company, stemming from its closeness to its roots, its Philly-spirit, the inspiring story of its founding fathers, and its talented and well-intentioned leaders, that is endearing and really works.","In growing and becoming so successful by practicing and embodying all the Pro's described above, Comcast is increasingly acquiring the absurdities of all large bureaucracies -- the useless layering of management being the most notable one. Supervisors don't 'have time to supervise, coach, or lead their people, because they have to be performing endless chores for, and being present in non-stop conference calls with, middle layer management. They do this,presumably, so their managers, in turn, can carry out the things the people they report task them with. The people most out of touch with reality in this arrangement are at the top, while those most in touch are at the bottom. The hierarchy is structured to ensure everyone from the top down focuses on the needs and imperatives of the person above him. Thus, the management ensure that its needs are placed ahead of those of the customers. (Comcast may not be alone in this faulty deployment of resources.) Comcast does not realize it has decimated its supervisory core with this ineffective from-the-top-down management strategy. It wonders why it continues to have difficulties with customer satisfaction, when it has much to do with the fact that the employees are not supervised. The supervisors are all away at meetings, learning more and more about managing. For Comcast to provide top-notch service, the management needs to be largely dispensed with, so the supervisors can be with their people, coaching them more and more on how to succeed in their job.",Comcast

Consequences for poor business decisions (and/or execution) are only received by technicians, customer service, and customers. - After entry level training, further training is difficult to receive. - technicians are not viewed with respect (more often as a scape goat), consequently promotion opportunities are limited. - Work load and time constraints are, at times, unreasonable; as well as inconsistent with customer service goals/mission statements. - Politics and favoritism are common place",Comcast

8549,"""Comcast Customer Account Executive""",1.0,Comcast gives its employees free cable and internet and the phone service for a small fee. That is definitely a plus because those are three bills you don't have to worry about paying. Also another thing I liked at Comcast was the paid vacation days you accumulated. It was a very reasonable amount of days I didn't complain about.,"The biggest downside I found working at Comcast was their scheduling process. The people that had been there the longest got first pick on the good schedules. That was totally understandable but when it was time for the newer employees to pick, we got stuck working late evenings and weekends. There has to be a better way to do the scheduling. No one wants to get stuck working late evenings and every weekend especially when you have children or things to do. Another thing I disliked while at Comcast was too many productivity levels and quotas to meet. I understand there has to be some sort of quality assurance but it seemed a little extreme to me. For example there were already specific numbers set in place as fas as how long you should stay on the phone with a customer for a billing issue, how long your hold time should be, and your sales upgrade rate. Every customer's situation is different and there should not be specific numbers to go by. Who knows how long it will take you to take care of that customer and you shouldn't have to worry about specific numbers to abide by.",Comcast

Good medical & dental insurance, however the monthly employee cost has increased. co-workers are great.","Taking incoming customer calls is extremely stressful. As with most call centers, phone agents are given certain ""metrics"" (call handle time, sales, etc) which must be met; if they are not, the rep will be ""written up"" which can result in termination. If reps are on a phone call with a customer longer than 10 min they receive messages from management telling them to wrap up the call & get on to the next one. Many employees do not last past their first year. There is little incentive to resolve the customers' problem over the phone, however there are a lot of incentives to sell products/services. Employee morale is low- some reasons are: daily verbal abuse from customers, constant threat of loosing employment if metrics are not met. Policies and procedures can change daily & if employees don't bother to read their email then they give customers incorrect information.",Comcast
