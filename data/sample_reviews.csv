,title,rating,pros,cons,company
0,good environment,5.0,positive work environment lots of room for growth.,can be lots of pressure from management at times.,Google
1,moving at the speed of light burn out is inevitable,4.0,"1 food food food.  15 cafes on main campus mtv alone.  minikitchens snacks drinks free breakfastlunchdinner all day errrday.

2 benefitsperks.  free 247 gym access on mtv campus.  free self service laundry washerdryer available.  bowling alley.  volley ball pit.  custombuilt and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park mtv.  free healthfitness assessments.  dogfriendly.  etc. etc. etc.

3 compensation.  in 2010 or 2011 google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.  

4 for the size of the organization 30k it has remained relatively innovative nimble and fastpaced and open with communication but that is definitely changing for the worse.

5 with so many departments focus areas and products in theory you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career horizontally or vertically.  in practice not true.  

6  you get to work with some of the brightest most innovative and hardworkingdiligent minds in the industry.  theres a con to that too see below.","1 worklife balance.  what balance  all those perks and benefits are an illusion.  they keep you at work and they help you to be more productive.  ive never met anybody at google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations.  you may not hear management say you have to work on weekendsvacations but they set the culture by doing so  and it inevitably trickles down.  i dont know if google inadvertently hires the workaholics or if they create workaholics in us.  regardless i have seen way too many of the following marriages fall apart colleagues choosing work and projects over family colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress colleagues crying while at work because of the stress colleagues shooting out emails at midnight 1am 2am 3am.  it is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.

2 poor management.  i think the issue is that a majority of people love google because they get to work on interesting technical problems  and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence.  perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too difficult.  people are promoted into management positions  not because they actually know how to leadmanage but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into.  so there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders.  yet there is no value system to actually do anything about that because emotional intelligence or adaptive leadership are not taken seriously.

3 jerks.  sure there are a lot of brilliant people  but sadly there are also a lot of jerks and many times they are one and the same.  years ago that wasnt the case.  i dont know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left or maybe people are getting burned out and its wearing on their personality and patience.  ive heard stories of managers straightup cussing out their employees and intimidatingscaring their employees into compliance.

4 its a giant company now and inevitably it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy.  so many political battles empire building territory grabbing.  google says dont be evil.  but that practice doesnt seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices.  ",Google
2,great balance between bigcompany security and fun fastmoving projects,5.0," if youre a software engineer youre among the kings of the hill at google. its an engineerdriven company without a doubt that is changing but its still very engineerfocused.
 the perks are amazing. yes free breakfast lunch an dinner every weekday. aaaaaamazing holiday parties at waldorf astoria ny public library moma etc. overnight ski trips to vermont overnight nature trips to the poconos in the summer summer picnics at chelsea piers and on and on and on. i dont see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.
 speaking of which the company is doing quite well which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.
 there a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide google project shield to crisis response during disasters see maps during hurricane sandy or tsunamis to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world to more mundane revenuedriving projects in advertising theres really something for everybody.
 its easy to move around within the company as long as youre in good standing the vast majority of engineers are.
 the company is amazingly open every week larry page and sergey brin host whats called tgif where food beer wine etc. is served a new project is presented and afterward theres an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. its truly fair game to ask anything no matter how controversial and frequently the executives will be responsive.
 no nobody cares if you use an iphone facebook shop with amazon stream using spotify or refuse to use google. the company is amazingly open and flexible.

neither pro nor con but general information on worklife balance promotions and advancement.
 work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time  but very few of them. if you do whats expected youll be fine at least for a handful of years. working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible and many people do it. there are also people who are hypermotived and work like crazy just because they love it or because theyre competitive or they want to get a promotion. if you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra youll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still  and maybe that doesnt matter so it works out for everybody. but at least know where you would realistically stand.
 if you excel and work your butt off youll be compensated and promoted. if you let yourself be a code monkey and just sit coding with your head down all day youll be fine but wont advance. a big complaint from some googlers is about not being able to advance even at google with pure coding. sure if youre the uber genius who created mapreduce and bigtable youre going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding but if youre like most engineers at google  smarter than average but just average compared to other googlers  youre just a good coder and not revolutionary. code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer its the minimum requirement but code monkeys wont advance because theyre not leaders and theyre easy to replace. to get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. there are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead so this isnt actually that hard so the real point is just that you cant just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance."," it is becoming larger and with it comes growing pains bureaucracy slow to respond to market threats bloated teams crossdivisional tension though nothing remotely approaching that of microsofts internal tension.
 the quality of the engineers is possibly dropping but possibly not. its hard to get real metrics because as the absolute number of people grows naturally the number of bad apples grows as a percentage its supposedly the same as it ever was but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just feels like things might be changing for the worse.
 also with growth means more internalconfidential data leaks again because of the raw numbers of people  product announcements being ruined etc. that means the company has to be tighterlipped internally to avoid leaks which makes things less open. its still an amazingly open place but less so than it was even a couple years ago. the good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.",Google
3,the best place ive worked and also the most demanding.,5.0,"you cant find a more wellregarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.

youll work on cutting edge projects  solve important issues that impact your community and the world

youll meet interesting people who are your colleagues managers and senior management.

youll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day and read about projects youre working on which is a cool thing

youll see larry and sergey at tgif and youll admire how they lead the company. they are brilliant goofy low key but intense and likeable. 

there are 22 cafes more or less the food is excellent and its free.

your pay will typically be competitive though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.

google cares about how it treats its employees.

the campus is like an academic campus in many ways.

there are tons of activities on campus like authors speaking about their books films after work and gyms where you can work out  but youll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.

youll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think youre smart and rich because you work there even if youre not rich and youre as smart when you didnt work at google.

if and when you leave youll never regret having that company on your resume. it opens doors. 

the company is flexible  if youre lucky you wont have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work  but dont get me wrong  youll work a lot. but you dont have to do all of it chained to your desk.","i live in sf so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle  sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. that means being on the bus for 34 hours per day. its a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to mountain view. but it can feel brutal.

your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at google and they affect how youre viewed and your ability to be promoted. you should always ask to work on high profile projects. if you dont get them dont expect to get high ratings or get promoted. always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure and then work hard at those things.

youll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what youre working on even if youre super quick at learning.  no one has time to train you or teach you what youre doing  which is kind of hard.

after two or three years people you started out with at google start to get promoted. if youre not one of them youll wonder why and how it happened and that process is somewhat political and not always clear. 

its a big company now. and super political. so dont be naive. expect some people to be catty some people to be territorial and be prepared to be mentally tough. dont let people see your vulnerableness. its a darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing  theyre not. theyre driven. if youre not driven youre not going to fit in.

when you start at google it seems like peer reviews are super important  they are but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. the important thing is that your direct manager knows your work likes your work and likes you and then you can get promoted. if your boss doesnt like you all the positive peer reviews in the world wont help you.  make sure you know what your boss wants and give it to them. you will have weekly one on ones and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one asking if they have questions how you can improve can you work on cross functional projects etc.

its really hard to find work life balance at google. the workload is huge.   i hardly have time to work out. the commute is brutal. my family sometimes needs more from me and i cant give it. im still trying to find the balance. i think i need more down time than most people so i have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things i want into my day so a lot of things slip like working out.",Google

30,google boulder is the place to be,5.0,unlike previous tech companies i have worked for i rarely feel overworked at google.  managers and team mates are respectful of worklife balance and even promote flexible work hours.  the colleagues that i work with are all such nice people and i attribute that to the emphasis that the company puts on only hiring people that are googley and how performance is partially measured on how well you work with others to accomplish a goal.  google boulder in particular is fantastic with new office facilities high quality free food and a laidback office atmosphere.,compared to my previous employers the purse strings at google are extremely tight when it comes to tampe.   many teams only have the budget to see their noncolocated managers and coworkers facetoface one a year which is a real shame and can be a huge productivity hindrance.  this does not seem to be getting better yoy.,Google
