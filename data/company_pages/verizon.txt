The Verizon commitment is to put our customers first by providing excellent service and
great communications experiences. This is what we do and this is why we exist. By
focusing on our customers and being responsible members of our communities, we will
produce a solid return for our shareowners, create meaningful work for ourselves and
provide something of lasting value for society. As a result, Verizon will be recognized as a
great company.
In order to keep this commitment, we need to always honor our core values:
 INTEGRITY
Integrity is at the heart of everything we do. We are honest, ethical and upfront because
trust is at the foundation of our relationships with our customers, our communities, our
stakeholders and each other.
 RESPECT
We know it is critical that we respect everyone at every level of our business. We champion
diversity, embrace individuality and listen carefully when others speak.
 PERFORMANCE EXCELLENCE
We hold ourselves to a very high standard of performance. We prize innovative ideas and
the teamwork it takes to make them realities. We never stop asking ourselves how we can
make the customer experience better, and every day we find an answer.
 ACCOUNTABILITY
We take responsibility for our actions as individuals, as team members, and as an
organization. We work together, support one another and never let the customer — or our
coworkers — down.
Great companies are judged by what they do, not by what they say. To be the best, we’re
going to keep pushing ourselves in new and exciting directions. These values will guide our
every action.
