Live true.
Do the right thing, no compromise.
This underpins all our other values, and it begins with how we treat our customers and each other. None of us is perfect. But when we make a mistake, we have the character and courage to make it right and learn from it. 

Think big.
Innovate and get there first.
AT&T is where people come to invent the future. That’s been our legacy since the very beginning. In everything we do, we aim to set the pace for everyone else.

Pursue excellence.
In everything, every time.
We work tirelessly to make sure that everything we deliver represents our very best. We may not be perfect, but we always learn from our experiences and constantly improve.

Inspire imagination.
Give people what they don't expect.
Each day is an opportunity to create something that changes the way people see the world. And no one does that better than AT&T, from the stories created by WarnerMedia and throughout every other part of our company. We deliver the unexpected.

Be there.
When customers & colleagues need you most.
That’s when we’re at our best. Whether it’s restoring service during a natural disaster, helping a community recover from hardship or reporting the news from dangerous locations, our people rise to the occasion.

Stand for equality.
Speak with your actions.
Whatever a person’s race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, physical ability or other characteristic, we respect and value them. We know that building a greater understanding of our differences makes us stronger.

Embrace freedom.
Press, speech, beliefs.
Free speech, a free press and freedom of beliefs are vital to a healthy democracy. That’s why we commit our full weight and resources to support our reporters wherever they operate.

Make a difference.
Impact your world.
This defines who we are, both as a company and as individuals. We can each make a difference in our communities and for the people around us.
