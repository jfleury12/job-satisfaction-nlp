Accessibility
Technology is most powerful when it empowers everyone.
We want everyone to enjoy the everyday moments that technology helps make possible, so we work to make every Apple product accessible from the very start. Because the true value of a device isn’t measured by how powerful it is, but by how much it empowers you.
Education
Giving products, support, and opportunities to schools that need them most.
Apple has been part of the ConnectED initiative since 2014, pledging $100 million of teaching and learning solutions to 114 underserved schools across the country. We’ve donated an iPad to every student, a Mac and iPad to every teacher, and an Apple TV to every classroom. And we’ve implemented a process that provides planning, professional learning, and ongoing guidance so every school can experience the transformational power of technology.
Environment
Truly innovative products leave their mark on the world instead of the planet.
Low impact.
The new standard of high performance.
Just as much innovation goes into the materials your Apple products are made of — and how they’re made — as into what they do. You can see that in the new MacBook Air and Mac mini. Their enclosures are made from 100% recycled aluminum, without compromising strength or finish. In so many ways, the most advanced products are the ones that make the least environmental impact.
Inclusion & Diversity
Different together.
At Apple, we’re not all the same. And that’s our greatest strength. We draw on the differences in who we are, what we’ve experienced, and how we think. Because to create products that serve everyone, we believe in including everyone.
Privacy
Privacy is a fundamental human right. At Apple, it’s also one of our core values. Your devices are important to so many parts of your life. What you share from those experiences, and who you share it with, should be up to you. We design Apple products to protect your privacy and give you control over your information. It’s not always easy. But that’s the kind of innovation we believe in.
Supplier Responsibility
People come first.
In everything we do.
We care deeply about the people who build our products, and the planet we all share. So we hold ourselves and our suppliers to the highest standards to ensure everyone is treated with dignity and respect. And we share our work openly so others can follow our lead.
