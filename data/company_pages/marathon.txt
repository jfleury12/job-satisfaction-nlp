Enhancing Life’s Possibilities

Safety & Environmental Stewardship
Protecting our people and the world we all share has been and remains a priority to MPC.

We aim for an accident-free, incident-free workplace to ensure everyone goes home safely, every day. We are committed to safe and environmentally responsible operations to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors, and communities.

Integrity
Integrity at MPC is more than the business conduct policies and procedures we follow.

We set high expectations for ourselves and build trust in each other, with business partners, shareholders and the communities where we work and live. We say what we’re going to do – and then do it.

Respect
Respect is built upon the principle that every one of us is valuable and contributes toward achieving our Vision.

We treat everyone professionally, with courtesy, honesty and trust. We consider how other people’s ideas can improve what we do and we encourage everyone to openly share their perspectives, ideas and concerns.

Inclusion
We value diversity in culture, background, perspective and experiences.

We strive to provide our employees with a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment where they can maximize their full potential for personal and business success. This happens when our employees, contractors, and other stakeholders feel valued themselves, and value others for who they are.

Collaboration
We are a company of driven, accomplished professionals who are more than the sum of their training and experience.

We actively partner with our communities, governments, and business partners to find and create shared values, making a positive difference together. We foster constructive, solution-oriented dialogues; we genuinely listen to one another and see out perspectives different from our own.
